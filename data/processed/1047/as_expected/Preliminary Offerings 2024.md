U.S. dollars.

The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after, 2027, at the redemption prices set forth in
this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date. The Issuer may also redeem up to % of the Notes prior to, 2027, at a redemption price equal to % of the
principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to, 2027, the Issuer may
redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount, plus a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Upon the

The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by GFL Environmental Inc. (“GFL”) and GFL’s
other existing and future Material Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined below) that, together with other entities, guarantee the Term
Facility (as defined below) and the Existing Unsecured Notes (as defined below). The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior unsecured
obligations and will rank equally in right of payment to all of its existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to all
of the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ (as defined below) future subordinated debt (if any). The Notes will be effectively subordinated to
all of the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, including
its obligations under the Credit Facilities (as defined below) and the Existing Notes. The Note Guarantees (as defined below) will
rank equally in right of payment with all of the Guarantors’ existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of
the Guarantors’ future subordinated debt (if any). In addition, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any nonguarantor subsidiaries, including, the subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes but do not
guarantee the Notes.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), or the
securities laws of any other place. We do not intend to register the Notes for an exchange offer under the 1933 Act. Unless they are
registered, the Notes may be offered only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the 1933 Act and applicable state
securities laws. We and the initial purchasers named below are offering the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be
qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. in reliance on Regulation S under the 1933
Act. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Transfer Restrictions.”


The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors in book-entry form through The Depository Trust
Company (“DTC”) on or about, 2024.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

Neither we nor the initial purchasers have authorized any person to provide you with information
different from that contained in or incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. Neither we nor
the initial purchasers take any responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any
other information that others may give to you. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are making an offer to
sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume the
information appearing, or incorporated by reference, in this Offering Memorandum is accurate only as of
the date on the front cover of this Offering Memorandum unless otherwise stated herein and is subject to
change, completion or amendment without notice. Unless required by applicable law, we assume no obligation
to publicly update any of the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum. Neither the delivery of this Offering Memorandum at any time, nor any subsequent
commitment to enter into any financing shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there
has been no change in the information set forth in this Offering Memorandum, or in our affairs, since the date
of this Offering Memorandum. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may
have changed since such dates.

We are relying on an exemption from registration under the 1933 Act for offers and sales of securities
that do not involve a public offering. Further, this offering has not been and will not be qualified for
distribution to the public under applicable Canadian securities laws and, accordingly, any distribution of
the Notes will be made on a basis which is exempt from, or not subject to, the prospectus requirements of such
securities laws. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made the acknowledgments,
representations, warranties and agreements set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions” in this
Offering Memorandum. You should understand that you may be required to bear the financial risks of
your investment for an indefinite period of time. The initial purchasers are relying on exemptions from the
provisions of Section 5 of the 1933 Act provided by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the 1933 Act and
certain registration and prospectus exemptions provided under Canadian securities law in connection
with the initial resale of the Notes. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and
may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws
and Canadian securities laws pursuant to a registration statement or an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, registration requirements of the 1933 Act and any applicable state securities laws and the
prospectus requirements of any applicable Canadian securities laws.

We have submitted this Offering Memorandum confidentially to a limited number of institutional
investors that we reasonably believe to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the
1933 Act or to persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the 1933 Act, in
any case so they can consider a purchase of the Notes. We have not authorized its use for any other purpose.
This Offering Memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part. It may be distributed,
and its contents disclosed, only to the prospective investors to whom it is provided. By accepting delivery of
this Offering Memorandum, you agree to these restrictions. By accepting delivery, you also acknowledge
that this Offering Memorandum contains confidential information and you agree that the use of this
information for any purpose other than considering a purchase of the Notes is strictly prohibited. You
should promptly return this Offering Memorandum, as well as other materials we may subsequently provide
to you, if you decide not to participate in this offering or if we terminate this offering. These undertakings
and prohibitions are intended for our benefit and may be enforced by us.

This Offering Memorandum is based on information provided by us and other sources we believe are
reliable. The initial purchasers are not making any promise, representation or warranty that this information
is accurate or complete and are not responsible for this information. We have summarized certain documents
and other information in a manner we believe to be accurate, but we refer you to the actual documents for a
more complete understanding of what we discuss in this Offering Memorandum. In making an investment
decision, you must rely on your own examination of our business and the terms of this offering and the Notes,
including, without limitation, the merits and risks involved.

This offering is being made on the basis of this Offering Memorandum. Any decision to purchase the
Notes in this offering must be based on the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this


-----

Offering Memorandum. You should contact us or the initial purchasers with any questions about this
offering or if you require additional information to verify the information contained in or incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum.

We and the initial purchasers reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the Notes at any time. We
and the initial purchasers also reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part
for any reason and to allot to any prospective investor less than the full amount of the Notes sought by it.

Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the offer
and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum or any of the Notes are
delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions. Each prospective purchaser of the
Notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction in which it purchases,
offers or sells the Notes or possesses or distributes this document and must obtain any consent, approval
or permission required under any regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it
makes such purchases, offers or sales, and neither we nor the initial purchasers shall have any responsibility
therefor.

**THE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH, RECOMMENDED BY OR APPROVED**
**BY THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”), ANY SECURITIES**
**COMMISSION OR SIMILAR REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF ANY PROVINCE OR TERRITORY**
**OF CANADA, OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY COUNTRY**
**OR AUTHORITY. NEITHER THE SEC, NOR ANY SECURITIES COMMISSION OR SIMILAR**
**REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF ANY PROVINCE OR TERRITORY OF CANADA OR ANY OTHER**
**REGULATORY COMMISSION OR AUTHORITY HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF**
**THESE SECURITIES OR DETERMINED IF THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM IS TRUTHFUL**
**OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.**

The U.S. federal securities laws and applicable provincial securities and corporate laws prohibit
trading in our securities while in possession of material non-public information with respect to us.

The global notes representing beneficial interests sold in reliance on Rule 144A, or the Rule 144A global
notes, and the global notes representing beneficial interests sold in reliance on Regulation S, or the Regulation S
global notes, will each be deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
the nominee of DTC. Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A global notes and in the Regulation S global notes
will be held only through DTC and any of its participants. After initial issuance of the global notes, notes
in certificated form may be issued in exchange for the global notes only in the limited circumstances set forth
in the Indenture. The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of US$2,000 and
integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form” for further discussion
of these matters.

By accepting delivery of this Offering Memorandum, you acknowledge that: (1) you have been
afforded an opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be
necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in or incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum; (2) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person
affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the accuracy of such information
or your investment decision; (3) this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from
registration under the 1933 Act; and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to make any
representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum, other than
as contained in or incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum and information given by our
duly authorized officers in connection with an investor’s examination of us and the terms of this offering.

Investors subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or
Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, should consult with their advisors as
to the appropriateness of their investment in the Notes.

Some persons participating in this offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or
otherwise affect the price of the Notes, at levels that might not otherwise prevail in the open market. This
stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see “Plan of
_Distribution.”_


-----

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about,
2024, which is the business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as
“T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“1934 Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on
any day prior to the initial T+ settlement will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes
initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery
hereunder should consult their own advisors.

**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors.” Prospective purchasers should conduct their own**
**investigation and analysis of the business, data and transactions described herein. Neither the Company nor**
**any of the initial purchasers are providing any legal, business, tax or other advice in this Offering Memorandum.**
**Each prospective purchaser should consult with its own advisors as needed to assist in making an investment**
**decision regarding the Notes and to advise whether the investment in the Notes is legally permitted by it.**

The head office of the Issuer is located at 26999 Central Park Blvd., Suite 200, Southfield,
Michigan 48076, United States. The head office of GFL is located at 100 New Park Place, Suite 500,

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements and
forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking information”) within the meaning of Section 27A
of the 1933 Act, Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable
securities laws in Canada. Forward-looking information includes all statements that do not relate solely to
historical or current facts, may relate to anticipated events or results and may include statements regarding our
objectives, plans, goals, strategies, outlook, results of operations, financial and operating performance,
prospects and opportunities. Particularly, statements regarding our expectations of future results,
performance, achievements, prospects or opportunities or the markets in which we operate are forwardlooking information. In some cases, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as “plans”, “targets”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “an
opportunity exists”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “outlook”, “forecasts”, “projection”, “prospects”,
“strategy”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “does not anticipate”, “believes”, or variations of such words and
phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might”, “will”, “will
be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved”, although not all forward-looking information includes those words
or phrases. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, intentions, projections or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances contain forward-looking information. Statements
containing forward-looking information are not historical facts nor assurances of future performance but
instead represent management’s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events or
circumstances.

Discussions containing forward-looking information may be found, among other places, under
(i) “Summary”, “Risk Factors” and “Use of Proceeds” included in this Offering Memorandum and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the
three months and year ended December 31, 2023”, “Description of the Business”, and “Risk Factors”
included in the Form 40-F (as defined herein) and incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum
and (ii) the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for
the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024” filed as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company’s Form 6-K filed with the
SEC on May 2, 2024, and incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

   - expectations regarding seasonality, industry trends, overall market growth rates and our growth rates
and growth strategies;

   - our business plans and strategies; and

   - our competitive position in our industry.

These forward-looking statements and other forward-looking information are based on our opinions,
estimates and assumptions in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions
and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we currently believe are appropriate and
reasonable in the circumstances. Despite a careful process to prepare and review the forward-looking
information, there can be no assurance that the underlying opinions, estimates and assumptions will prove
to be correct. Certain assumptions in respect of our ability to build our market share; our ability to retain key
personnel; our ability to maintain and expand geographic scope; our ability to continue to grow our
revenue and improve operating margins; our ability to maintain good relationships with our customers; our
ability to execute on our expansion plans; our ability to respond to changing customer and legal

acquisition opportunities and successfully integrate acquired businesses; our ability to continue investing in
infrastructure to support our growth; our ability to obtain and maintain existing financing on acceptable
terms; our ability to implement price increases or offset increasing costs; currency exchange and interest rates;
the impact of competition; our potential liability, if any, in connection with environmental matters; the
changes and trends in our industry or the global economy; and the changes in laws, rules, regulations, and
global standards are material factors made in preparing forward-looking information and management’s
expectations.

Forward-looking information is necessarily based on a number of opinions, estimates and assumptions
that we considered appropriate and reasonable as of the date such information is stated and is subject to
known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results,
level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by
such forward-looking information, including but not limited to the following:

   - substantial governmental regulation, changes thereto and risks associated with failure to comply,
including regulations with respect to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances;

   - liabilities in connection with environmental matters;

   - public health emergencies or pandemics have and could continue to adversely impact our business;

us that we will achieve such operating results;

   - dependence on third-party facilities;

   - our access to equity or debt capital markets is not assured;

   - increases in labour, disposal, and related transportation costs;

   - fuel supply and fuel price fluctuations;

instruments;

- potential inability to obtain performance or surety bonds, letters of credit, other financial assurances
or insurance;

- operational, health, safety and environmental risks;

- dependence on our key personnel;

- natural disasters, weather conditions and seasonality;

- increasing dependence on technology and risk of technology failure;

- cybersecurity incidents or issues;

- damage to our reputation or our brand;

- increases in insurance costs;

- climate change regulations that could increase our costs to operate;

- failure to achieve our sustainability goals;

- failure to comply with U.S., Canadian or foreign anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws or regulations;

- we incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company;

- risks associated with our internal control over financial reporting;

- efforts by labour unions could divert management attention;

- landfill site closure and post-closure costs and contamination-related costs;

disclosure requirements and governance standards applicable to domestic U.S. issuers;

- GFL’s loss of foreign private issuer status;

- volatility of the market price of our subordinate voting shares;

- subordinate voting shares are equity interests and are subordinate to our existing and future
indebtedness and preferred shares;

- our substantial indebtedness outstanding;

- increased indebtedness may reduce our financial flexibility;

- ability to maintain our credit rating;


-----

   - ability to meet our debt obligations depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and the ability
to utilize the cash flows from our subsidiaries;

   - any adverse rating action with respect to the Notes may cause their trading price to fall;

   - we may spend the proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which
may not yield a return;

   - an active, liquid and orderly trading market for the Notes failing to develop;

   - we are only responsible for the information contained, or incorporated by reference, in this Offering
Memorandum;

   - ability to enforce civil liabilities against us and our directors and officers;

   - governing laws of GFL in Ontario, Canada could, in some cases, have a different effect on
shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware, United States;

   - derivative actions, actions relating to breach of fiduciary duties and other matters relating to our
internal affairs will be required to be litigated in Canada, which could limit shareholders’ ability to
obtain a favourable judicial forum for disputes with us;

   - claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy
successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of insurance coverage available
to us;

   - provisions of Canadian law may delay, prevent or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a
significant portion of the GFL’s shares or assets; and

   - other factors that may be beyond our control.

The opinions, estimates or assumptions referred to above and described in greater detail in “Risk
_Factors” in the Form 40-F (as defined herein) should be considered carefully by readers._

These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with other cautionary
statements contained, or incorporated by reference, in this Offering Memorandum. Although we have
attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in forward-looking information, there may be other risk factors not currently known to us or that
we currently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially
from those expressed in such forward-looking information. Accordingly, readers should not place undue
reliance on forward-looking information. The forward-looking information contained in or incorporated
by reference in this Offering Memorandum represents our expectations as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum (or as the date it is otherwise stated as of) and is subject to change after such date. However,
we disclaim any intention or obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking information
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable laws.

All of the forward-looking information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum is expressly qualified by the foregoing cautionary statements. Investors should read this
entire Offering Memorandum and consult their own professional advisors to ascertain and assess the income
tax, legal, risk factors and other aspects of their investment in the Notes.

**GENERAL MATTERS**

While GFL US is a Delaware corporation, GFL is incorporated under the laws of the Province of
Ontario. Some of the controlling persons of GFL are residents of Canada, and certain of its directors and
officers, as well as certain of the experts named in this Offering Memorandum, are residents of Canada, and
all or a substantial portion of their assets and a substantial portion of GFL’s assets are located outside of
the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for holders of the Notes to effect service of process within
the United States upon our directors, officers and experts who are not residents of the United States or to
realize in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liability
under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the United States. There are defenses that can be
raised to the enforceability, in original actions in Canadian courts, of liabilities based upon the U.S. federal


-----

securities laws and to the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions
based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws, such that the enforcement in Canada
of such liabilities and judgments is not certain. Therefore, it may not be possible to enforce those actions
against us, our directors and officers or the experts named in this Offering Memorandum.

The information in this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from the registration
requirements under the 1933 Act. The information included in, and incorporated by reference in, this Offering
Memorandum is not intended to, and does not, comply with all of the disclosure requirements of the SEC
that would apply if this offering were being made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC.
Compliance with such requirements could require the modification or exclusion of certain financial
measures, and the presentation of certain other information not included, or incorporated by reference, in
this Offering Memorandum or the exclusion of certain information included herein. There are no SEC
registration rights associated with the Notes, and we have no intention to offer to exchange the Notes
pursuant to a registration statement to be filed with the SEC. The Indenture will not be qualified under the
U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Except as otherwise provided, our financial statements
incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which for us are International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which differ from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), in certain material respects,
and thus are not comparable to financial statements and financial information of companies reporting under
U.S. GAAP.

This Offering Memorandum does not contain, nor does it purport to contain, a summary of all of the
terms and conditions of the Notes. Any reference in this Offering Memorandum to the terms and conditions
of the Notes is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Indenture. See “Description of
_Notes.” Information in this Offering Memorandum has not been prepared with respect to matters which may_
be of particular concern to Canadian investors and, accordingly, should be read with this in mind. This
Offering Memorandum does not contain all of the information that would normally be contained or
incorporated by reference in a prospectus prepared in accordance with Canadian securities laws. No securities
commission in Canada has reviewed this Offering Memorandum. The Notes have not been and will not be
qualified for sale to the public under applicable Canadian securities laws.

**Currency and Exchange Rate Information**

GFL presents its financial statements in Canadian dollars. Unless otherwise specifically stated,
references to “C$,” “dollars” or “$” in this Offering Memorandum mean Canadian dollars. References to
“USD,” “US$” and “U.S. dollars” mean U.S. dollars.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the average, high, low and end-of-period

**NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES**

The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in other public disclosures of
“non-GAAP financial measures,” which include, among others described below, Adjusted EBITDA and the
ratios related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance
with GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented
and require, among other things:

   - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or
measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and

   - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-GAAP
financial measure.

The rules prohibit, among other things:

   - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement
absent an ability to settle in another manner from non-GAAP liquidity measures; and

  - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as
non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably
likely to occur.

With respect to foreign private issuers whose primary financial statements are prepared in accordance
with IFRS or a home-country GAAP, references to “GAAP” in the definition of the “non-GAAP financial
measure” discussed above refer to the principles under which those primary financial statements are
prepared, which in our case is IFRS.

We refer to the terms Acquisition EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA
(each as defined below and together, the “Non-IFRS Measures”) in various places in this Offering
Memorandum and in the information incorporated by reference herein. These are supplemental financial
measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP. Any analysis of non-IFRS Measures
should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP.

The Non-IFRS Measures are not recognized terms under IFRS or U.S. GAAP. Certain of the
adjustments used to derive these Non-IFRS Measures would not be allowed under Regulation S-X. In
addition, our measurements of the Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to those of other companies.
Please see “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information” for a discussion of our
use of the Non-IFRS Measures in this Offering Memorandum, including the reasons that we believe this
information is useful to management and to investors, and a reconciliation of the relevant Non-IFRS
Measures to the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS or U.S.
GAAP.

These Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than,
net income (loss), cash flow from operating activities and other measures of financial performance as
determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of performance, but we believe these measures are
useful to both our management and to investors in providing relative performance and measuring change.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.

“Acquisition EBITDA” represents, for the applicable period, management’s estimates of the annual
Adjusted EBITDA of an acquired business, based on its most recently available historical financial


-----

information at the time of acquisition, as adjusted to give effect to (a) the elimination of expenses related to
the prior owners and certain other costs and expenses that are not indicative of the underlying business
performance, if any, as if such business had been acquired on the first day of such period and (b) contract
and acquisition annualization for contracts entered into and acquisitions completed by such acquired business
prior to our acquisition (collectively, “Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments”). Further adjustments are made
to such annual Adjusted EBITDA to reflect estimated operating cost savings and synergies, if any, anticipated
to be realized upon acquisition and integration of the business into our operations. Acquisition EBITDA
is calculated net of divestitures. We use Acquisition EBITDA for the acquired businesses to adjust our
Adjusted EBITDA to include a proportional amount of the Acquisition EBITDA of the acquired businesses
based upon the respective number of months of operation for such period prior to the date of our
acquisition of each such business.

Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments are based on detailed financial due diligence in respect of the target
business and account for (a) any known changes to the target business that are not yet fully reflected in the
historical financial records and (b) planned cost saving initiatives to be implemented following the acquisition.
Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments are intended to eliminate costs, expenses and benefits, that are not
indicative of the underlying business performance of the acquired business, such as (i) one time revenues
earned prior to our acquisition of the business, (ii) costs related to prior ownership, which generally reflect
the elimination of compensation and other payments to the prior owners that are not considered necessary to
operate the acquired business, and (iii) other costs and expenses such as temporary truck rentals, relocation
expenses, bad debt expense and certain professional fees. Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments also reflect
adjustments such as (i) contract annualization, which generally includes the incremental EBITDA that a
particular contract commenced during the applicable period would have generated if such contract had
commenced on the first day of the applicable fiscal period, (ii) acquisition annualization, which generally
reflects the incremental revenue that a particular acquisition consummated by an acquired entity, but
before we acquired such entity, during the applicable fiscal period would have generated if such acquisition
had been consummated on the first day of the applicable fiscal period, and (iii) cost synergies anticipated to be
realized in the near-term, which generally reflects estimated vehicle operating, administrative, labour and
disposal cost savings anticipated to be realized upon the integration of an acquired business as if such cost
savings were realized at the beginning of the period, each adjusted to Adjusted EBITDA.

“Adjusted EBITDA” is a supplemental measure used by management and other users of our financial
statements, including our lenders and investors, to assess the financial performance of our business without
regard to financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA is also a key metric that management
uses prior to execution of any strategic investing or financing opportunity. For example, management uses
Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions, expansion opportunities, and
dispositions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is utilized by financial institutions to measure borrowing
capacity. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding and deducting, as applicable from EBITDA, certain
expenses, costs, charges or benefits incurred in such period which in management’s view are either not
indicative of underlying business performance or impact the ability to assess the operating performance of
our business, including: (a) (gain) loss on foreign exchange, (b) (gain) loss on sale of property and equipment,
(c) mark-to-market (gain) loss on Purchase Contracts, (d) share of net (income) loss of investments
accounted for using the equity method for associates, (e) share-based payments, (f) (gain) loss on divestiture,
(g) transaction costs, (h) acquisition, rebranding and other integration costs (included in cost of sales
related to acquisition activity) and (i) other. We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of our
operating performance on a consistent basis reflecting factors and trends affecting our business. As we
continue to grow our business, we may be faced with new events or circumstances that are not indicative of
our underlying business performance or that impact the ability to assess our operating performance.

“EBITDA” represents, for the applicable period, net income (loss) from continuing operations plus
(a) interest and other finance costs, plus (b) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment,
landfill assets and intangible assets, plus (less) (c) the provision (recovery) for income taxes, in each case to
the extent deducted from or added to/from net income (loss) from continuing operations. We present EBITDA
to assist readers in understanding the mathematical development of Adjusted EBITDA. Management
does not use EBITDA as a financial performance metric.

“Run-Rate EBITDA” represents Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable period as adjusted to give effect
to management’s estimates of (a) Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments and (b) the impact of annualization of


-----

certain new municipal and disposal contracts and cost savings initiatives, entered into, commenced or
implemented, as applicable, in such period, as if such contracts or costs savings initiatives had been entered
into, commenced or implemented, as applicable, on the first day of such period ((a) and (b), collectively,
“Run-Rate EBITDA Adjustments”). Run-Rate EBITDA has not been adjusted to take into account the impact
of the cancellation of contracts and cost increases associated with these contracts. These adjustments
reflect monthly allocations of Acquisition EBITDA for the acquired businesses based on straight line
proration. As a result, these estimates do not take into account the seasonality of a particular acquired
business. While we do not believe the seasonality of any one acquired business is material when aggregated
with other acquired businesses, the estimates may result in a higher or lower adjustment to our Run-Rate
EBITDA than would have resulted had we adjusted for the actual results of each of the acquired businesses
for the period prior to our acquisition. We primarily use Run-Rate EBITDA to show how GFL would have
performed if each of the acquired businesses had been consummated at the start of the period as well as
to show the impact of the annualization of certain new municipal and disposal contracts and cost savings
initiatives. We also believe that Run-Rate EBITDA is useful to investors and creditors to monitor and evaluate
our borrowing capacity and compliance with certain of our debt covenants. Run-Rate EBITDA as presented
herein is calculated in accordance with the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement.

an inherent commitment to sustainability and investing in our employees and communities.

We operate in the large and stable North American environmental services industry. Key characteristics
of our industry include relative recession resistance, high visibility of waste volumes, a stringent regulatory
framework, high capital intensity to achieve scale and significant fragmentation which, in turn, has led to
strong consolidation activity.

approach to meeting all of our customers’ environmental service needs, including the increasing demand for
sustainable solutions. Our diversified offerings consist of solid waste management and liquid waste
management and soil remediation services, including collection, transportation, transfer, recycling and

(1) Total capital expenditures represents purchases of property and equipment as reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the relevant period, including maintenance capital expenditures.
Total capital expenditures excludes asset acquisitions financed through capital leases, as disclosed in
the audited annual consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum.

(2) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA are not measures of performance in accordance
with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/loss or operating cash flows
determined in accordance with IFRS. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Run-Rate EBITDA in this Offering Memorandum is appropriate to provide additional information to
investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-IFRS financial
measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the
relative risk of an investment in our securities. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” Each of EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of
these limitations are:

   - although amortization is a non-cash charge, the assets being amortized will often have to be replaced
in the future and none of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA nor Run-Rate EBITDA reflects any cash
requirements for such replacements;

   - none of them reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

   - none of them reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;


-----

- none of them reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments, on our significant amount of indebtedness; and

- none of them reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to
be indicative of our ongoing operations but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of
operations.

In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations of EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies, including companies in our industry. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and RunRate EBITDA should not be taken as representative of our future results of operations or financial
position. For example, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may not
_be able to achieve management’s estimate of the annualized Run-Rate EBITDA of the acquired businesses_
_outlined under ‘Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information’”._

Run-Rate EBITDA is not a measurement of our historical financial performance under IFRS and
should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of
our liquidity.

We present Run-Rate EBITDA because we believe it represents an estimate of the potential of our
ongoing operations to generate recurring revenue and Adjusted EBITDA if the acquisitions referred to
below had closed on the dates noted. These “as if” estimates of potential operating results were not
prepared in accordance with IFRS or the pro forma rules of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.
The presentation of Run-Rate EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future
results will be consistent with these “as if” estimates. Furthermore, while Run-Rate EBITDA gives
effect to management’s estimate of a full year of Acquisition EBITDA in respect of acquisitions
completed in the applicable period, Run-Rate EBITDA does not give effect to any Acquisition EBITDA
in respect of such acquisitions for any period prior to such applicable period. As a result, the RunRate EBITDA across different periods may not necessarily be comparable.

In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Run-Rate
EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies
in our industry. In addition, as described in more detail in notes to the tables set forth in this “Summary
_Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information,” our Run-Rate EBITDA is based on a number of_
assumptions and estimates. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results of operations for
each of the periods presented are significantly different from our Run-Rate EBITDA for those same
periods as a result of the actual achievement of estimated revenues from new municipal and disposal
contracts and cost saving initiatives, seasonality or otherwise. For more information regarding risk factors
that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations, see “Risk Factors.”

Because of these limitations, Run-Rate EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by
relying primarily on our actual historical results and using Run-Rate EBITDA only for supplemental
purposes. For a description of risks related to Run-Rate EBITDA, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_our Business—Our Run-Rate EBITDA is based on certain estimates and assumptions and should not be_
_regarded as a representation by us or any other person that we will achieve such operating results. Prospective_
_investors should not place undue reliance on our Run-Rate EBITDA and should make their own_
_independent assessment of our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.”_

The following table reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA to our net loss for
the periods indicated:

Standard & Poor’s, provided at such time no default or event of
default has occurred and is continuing. See “Description of Notes.”

redemption of the 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes will be made solely
pursuant to a redemption notice delivered in accordance with the
indenture governing the 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes. Nothing
contained in this Offering Memorandum constitutes a notice of
redemption of the 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes.

**Transfer Restrictions: . . . . . . . .** The Notes have not been registered under the 1933 Act or any other
applicable securities laws. Unless they are registered, the Notes

1933 Act and applicable state securities laws. In addition, we have
not filed and will not file a prospectus in any province or territory of
Canada with respect to the Notes. Unless qualified by a prospectus,
the Notes may not be offered or sold in Canada except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. See
_“Transfer Restrictions,” “Plan of Distribution” and “ Risk Factors—_

established market. We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be
listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for any quotation
system to quote them. There can be no assurance that a market for
the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, it may not provide
adequate liquidity. Although the initial purchasers have advised us
that they intend to make a market for the Notes, they are not obligated
to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes
will develop or be maintained.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the Notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with_
_the other information contained in and incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum, including (i) the_
_risks and uncertainties discussed under the section “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted_
_Financial Information” included in this Offering Memorandum, the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to Our Business and Industry” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition_
_and Results of Operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023” and the audited financial_
_statements and the notes thereto each included in the Form 40-F and incorporated by reference herein and (ii) the_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for the Three_
_Months ended March 31, 2024” and the unaudited financial statements and the related notes thereto filed as_
_exhibits to the Company’s 6-K filed with the SEC on May 2, 2024 and incorporated by reference herein before_
_you decide to purchase the Notes. The risks and uncertainties incorporated by reference and described below are_
_not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we_
_currently believe are immaterial may also adversely impact our business operations. If any of the following risks_
_actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In such case, the_
_trading price of the Notes on the secondary market could fall, we may not be able to meet our obligations under_
_the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment._

_Our operations are affected by a number of underlying risks, both internal and external to the Company._
_Our financial position and results of operations are directly impacted by these factors. A potential purchaser_
_should consult its own financial and legal advisors before deciding whether to purchase the Notes._

**Risks Related to our Business and Industry (in addition to the risks set forth under “Risk Factors—Risks**
**_Related to Our Business and Industry” included in our Form 40-F and incorporated by reference herein)_**

**_We may not be able to achieve management’s estimate of the annualized Run-Rate EBITDA of the acquired_**
**_businesses outlined under “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information.”_**

We have prepared estimates of Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments, contract annualization, cost savings
and other adjustments and Acquisition EBITDA of businesses that we acquired that are reflected in our RunRate EBITDA and set forth under “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information.”
These estimates, including our estimates, of Acquisition EBITDA for each of the businesses we have
acquired, have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, the requirements of Regulation S-X
or any other accounting or securities regulations relating to the presentation of pro forma financial
information. In particular, the adjustments set forth under “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted
_Financial Information” do not account for seasonality and are not a guarantee that such results will_
actually be realized. While we do not believe the seasonality of any one acquired business is material when
aggregated with other acquired businesses, the estimates may result in a higher or lower adjustment to our RunRate EBITDA than would have resulted had we adjusted for the actual results of each of the acquired
businesses for the period prior to our acquisition.

Our failure to achieve the expected Adjusted EBITDA contributions could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our Run-Rate EBITDA is based on certain estimates and assumptions and should not be regarded as a_**
**_representation by us or any other person that we will achieve such operating results. Prospective investors_**
**_should not place undue reliance on our Run-Rate EBITDA and should make their own independent assessment_**
**_of our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition._**

Our Run-Rate EBITDA set forth under “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial
_Information” represents our estimate of our anticipated annual operating results, including, without_
limitation, our estimates of (i) the contribution of acquired businesses in the periods prior to our acquisition,
and (ii) the contribution of certain contracts and agreements that we entered into during or after completion
of the applicable period as if they had commenced at the beginning of the applicable period as further
described in “Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” Our Run-Rate EBITDA is based on certain estimates and
assumptions, some or all of which may not materialize. Unanticipated events may occur that could have a
material adverse effect on the actual results achieved by us during the periods to which these estimates relate.


-----

Those assumptions are summarized under “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial
_Information” and “Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” Presentation of Run-Rate EBITDA excludes certain_
expense items, such as the impact of non-cash compensation, and such presentation is not intended to be a
substitute for historical IFRS measures of operating performance or liquidity. See “Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures,”“General Matters—Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and “Summary—_
_Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information” for a discussion of the limitations of non-IFRS_
financial measures and the Run-Rate calculations included in this Offering Memorandum.

Our Run-Rate EBITDA is subject to material risks, uncertainties and contingencies. We do not intend
to update or otherwise revise our Run-Rate EBITDA to reflect circumstances existing or arising after the
date of this Offering Memorandum, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Prospective investors
should make their own independent assessments of our ability to make principal and interest payments on
the Notes. Our Run-Rate EBITDA should not be relied upon for any purpose following the consummation of
this offering. No assurance can be given that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to pay, when
due, the principal of and interest on the Notes. The inclusion of our Run-Rate EBITDA should not be
regarded as a representation by us or any other person that we will achieve such operating results or revenues.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations under the Notes._**

We currently have, and after the completion of this offering will continue to have, a significant amount
of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds
therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” we would have had approximately $9,191.4 million of Total
Funded Debt (including the Notes), $5,807.2 million of secured indebtedness, including $276.1 million of
borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility (excluding $217.4 million of letters of credit
under the Revolving Credit Facility). We would have had availability for revolving borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility of $813.2 million (including $182.6 million in letters of credit under the Revolving
Credit Facility).

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of the Notes. For example:

   - it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and other
indebtedness;

   - our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate
purposes or acquisitions may be limited;

   - we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments
on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;

   - it could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry
in which we operate;

   - it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

   - it could expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including
certain of our borrowings under the Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;

   - it could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

   - our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing
our indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a
significant adverse effect on us; and

   - it could increase our cost of borrowing.

Although the terms of the Credit Facilities, Existing Indentures and the Indenture contain or will
contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, debt incurrence in compliance with these


-----

restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries’ current debt levels, the
related risks that we or our subsidiaries now face could be magnified.

In addition, the terms of the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture contain or
will contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term
best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured
or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our obligations, including our obligations_**
**_relating to the Notes, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness,_**
**_which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the indebtedness
incurred under the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the Notes, and to fund planned capital
expenditures and expansion efforts, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a
certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors
that are beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities
sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the
Notes.

There can be no guarantee that our business will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations,
or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility, in amounts sufficient
to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the Existing Notes and the Notes, as such indebtedness
matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this is the case, we will need to refinance all or a portion of
our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the Notes, on or before maturity,
and we cannot assure holders of Notes that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the
Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the Notes, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may
have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures,
selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners.
These financing strategies may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and, even if
successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our
ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing and/or to do so on commercially
reasonable terms will depend on, among other things:

   - our financial condition at the time;

   - restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the
Existing Indentures;

   - the Indenture; and

   - other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the environmental services
industry.

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or
proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our
obligations, including payments due on the Notes. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we
will be in default and holders of the Notes and the Existing Notes could declare all outstanding principal and
interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all borrowings thereunder
due and payable and/or terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders under the Credit Facilities
could foreclose or otherwise enforce their security interests against the assets securing their borrowings and
we could be forced into receivership, bankruptcy or liquidation. In order to avoid a liquidation, we could
commence an insolvency proceeding in an attempt to compromise, restructure or reorganize our debt. These
events could result in your losing or compromising all or a portion of your investment in the Notes.

**_The Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture contain or will contain covenants that restrict_**
**_our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and_**
**_economic conditions._**

The Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture contain or will contain covenants that
restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may limit our ability


-----

to respond to changing business and economic conditions or engage in acts that may be in our long-term
best interest. These covenants include limitations on, among other things, the ability to:

   - incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock;

   - pay dividends or make distributions and payments on other indebtedness;

   - prepay, redeem or repurchase stock;

   - issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;

   - make certain investments and acquisitions;

   - create liens;

   - engage in transactions with affiliates;

  - merge, amalgamate, consolidate or make other fundamental changes;

   - sell or dispose of assets;

   - engage in certain types of businesses; and

   - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants. Future
indebtedness or other contracts could contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those
contained in the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures or the Indenture.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political
decisions, regulations, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot
assure holders of the Notes that we will be able to comply with the covenants in the Credit Facilities, the
Existing Indentures and the Indenture. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Credit
Facilities, the Existing Indentures or the Indenture, including failure as a result of events beyond our control,
could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and
financial condition.

If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments, the holders of the defaulted debt
could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which
may cause cross-default to other debt. In addition, an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility
would permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further
credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the
Credit Facilities, those lenders, as applicable, could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure
that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and
our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions,
we may be:

   - limited in how we conduct our business;

   - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate; or

   - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our
financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability
and terms of our financing.

We cannot assure holders of Notes that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay
borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we
would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt instruments.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur substantially more_**
**_debt and make restricted payments. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described_**
**_above._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured
indebtedness, in the future as well as make dividends, distributions, stock and subordinated debt repurchases


-----

and investments. Although the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture contain or will
contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the making of restricted payments, these
restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness
incurred and restricted payments made in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The
Indenture will permit us to calculate our capacity to make restricted payments in a manner similar to our
Existing Indentures. As of March 31, 2024, we had restricted payment build-up capacity of $6,869.3 million.
If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements,
the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with you in any proceeds distributed in connection
with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company. This may
have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. These restrictions also will not prevent us
from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, after giving
effect to the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds”,
we would have had availability for revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $813.2
million (after giving effect to utilization of $217.4 million of letters of credit). All of those borrowings would
likely be secured indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels or cash is used to make
restricted payments, the related risks that the Issuer and the Guarantors now face could intensify. See
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the three months_
_and year ended December 31, 2023—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Available Sources of Liquidity”_
included in our Form 40-F and incorporated by reference herein and “Description of Notes.”

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities include interest rate options that are at variable rates of interest
and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable
rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net
income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, assuming all loans are fully drawn, each quarter point
change in interest rates would result in a $3.3 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness
under the Revolving Credit Facility and $2.5 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness
under the Term Facility. We have in the past and in the future we may enter into interest rate hedges, including
interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce
interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate hedges or swaps with respect to all of our
variable rate indebtedness, and any hedges or swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate
risk.

**_The Notes will not be secured by any of our assets, and a Noteholder’s right to enforce remedies is limited by_**
**_the rights of holders of our secured debt and the rights of the Guarantors’ secured creditors and may be limited_**
**_by other persons enjoying liens._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be unsecured obligations, and in the event of receivership,
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or similar proceedings relating to the Issuer or the Guarantors,
the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be equal in right of payment with the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
future unsubordinated debt (if any), and effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
existing and future secured debt, including the amounts borrowed or that may be borrowed under the
Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured Notes and the guarantees thereof, to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such debt. As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Notes offered hereby and the use
of proceeds therefrom as described under “ Use of Proceeds,” we would have had $5,047.8 million outstanding
in the aggregate under the Term Facility and the Existing Secured Notes, $276.1 million of borrowings
outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and commitments available for additional revolving
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $1,030.5 million, less $217.4 million of utilization in letters
of credit. In addition, we may incur additional secured debt in the future. Further, the Notes are structurally
subordinated to all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes, including subsidiaries that may guarantee the Credit Facilities
and the Existing Secured Notes but not the Notes.


-----

In the event of receivership, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or similar proceedings relating
to us or the guarantors, or if payment under the Credit Facilities or the Existing Secured Notes is accelerated,
holders of the Notes will participate with trade creditors and all other holders of unsecured indebtedness
in the assets remaining after we or the guarantor, as the case may be, has paid all of its secured debt. In any
of these cases, we may not have sufficient funds to pay all of our creditors and creditors of the guarantors
and holders of the Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of our or the guarantors’ secured debt or
nothing at all. In addition, the holders of the Notes do not have contractual rights to appoint a receiver
or receiver manager of our assets and will have to rely on the rights available to unsecured creditors. To the
extent that other persons enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture,
such persons may have rights and remedies with respect to us, our subsidiaries, and to the collateral
securing the Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds
available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.

**_We depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

Our subsidiaries conduct some of our operations and own some of our consolidated assets and certain
of GFL’s subsidiaries will, and in the future may, not be guarantors of the Notes or our other indebtedness.
Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to pay our debts, including the Notes, depend on our
subsidiaries’ earnings and cash flow and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt
repayment or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances
to us will depend upon not only their operating results, cash flow, financial condition, business and tax
considerations, legal and regulatory restrictions, and economic conditions, but also on applicable law and
contractual restrictions contained in instruments governing their indebtedness. Unless they are guarantors of
the Notes or our other indebtedness, GFL’s subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on
the Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be
able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the Notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances,
legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the
Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture limit or will limit the ability of our subsidiaries
to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us,
these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions
from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our
indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_The Notes are structurally subordinated to all obligations of GFL’s existing and future subsidiaries that are not_**
**_and do not become guarantors of the Notes._**

The Notes will be guaranteed by GFL and each of GFL’s existing and subsequently acquired or
organized Material Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that, together with other entities,
guarantee the Term Facility and the Existing Unsecured Notes, pursuant to the “Description of Notes—
_Note Guarantees.” Except for such Guarantors of the Notes, GFL’s subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent_
or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts,
whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. The Notes and Note Guarantees are structurally
subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of any non-guarantor subsidiary such that in the
event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any subsidiary that is not
a guarantor of the Notes, all of that subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors) would be entitled to
payment in full out of that subsidiary’s assets before we would be entitled to any payment.

As of March 31, 2024, GFL’s subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (other than the Issuer) collectively
had:

   - liabilities of $595.2 million (4.7% of our consolidated total liabilities); and

   - assets of $1,018.9 million (5.1% of our consolidated total assets).

For Fiscal 2023, GFL’s subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (other than the Issuer) collectively
generated revenue of $215.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $59.5 million, which includes intercompany
transactions with the Issuer and the Guarantors.


-----

In addition, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, subject to some limitations, permit or will
permit these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and do not contain any limitation on the amount
of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the offer required by the Indenture on a_**
**_Change of Control Triggering Event or occurrence of certain asset sales._**

Under the indenture that will govern the Notes offered hereby, upon the occurrence of certain events
constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event or resulting in an Asset Sale Offer under the Indenture,
we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes and all outstanding Existing Notes. However,
it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the Change of Control Triggering Event
or Asset Sale to make the required repurchase of the Notes and the Existing Notes or that restrictions under
the Credit Facilities will not allow such repurchases.

Our ability to repurchase the Notes and the Existing Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or
Asset Sale Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The indentures governing the Existing Notes also
contain similar change of control offer provisions. The occurrence of the events constituting a Change of
Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale Offer under the Indenture and the Existing Indentures may constitute
a default under the Credit Facilities and may result in an event of default in respect of our and our
subsidiaries’ other current or future indebtedness and, consequently, the lenders thereof may have the right
to require repayment of such indebtedness in full. The source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes and
the Existing Notes and repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facilities would be our available cash or
cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or
sales of equity. Moreover, the exercise by holders of Notes of their right to require us to repurchase the
Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale Offer could cause a default under these other
agreements, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale Offer itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchases on us. Our failure to repurchase the Notes would be an event of default
under the Indenture and the Existing Indentures and also under the Credit Facilities. See “Description of
_Notes—Offers to Repurchase.”_

In the event a Change of Control Offer is required to be made at a time when we are prohibited from
repurchasing the Notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibitions. If we
do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from repurchasing the
Notes. In that case, our failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness. Finally, our ability to
pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources.

In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes and events of default and potential breaches
of the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture we may have to avoid certain change of
control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the
Indenture, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those
corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital
structure, credit ratings or the value of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Offers to Repurchase—
_Change of Control Triggering Event.”_

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have_**
**_the Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of
“all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially
all” under applicable law and the interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts
and circumstances. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require us to repurchase its notes as
a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.


-----

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register or_**
**_qualify any resale of the Notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer_**
**_or resell the Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to transactions that are exempt from, or not subject to,
registration under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws and the prospectus requirements of
applicable Canadian securities laws. We do not currently intend, and holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to require us to, register or qualify the Notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell
the Notes only in a transaction exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the 1933 Act
and applicable state securities laws and the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws
or pursuant to an effective registration statement or prospectus, as applicable. Accordingly, you may have
difficulty transferring your notes, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an
indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_An active trading market may not be maintained for the Notes._**

The Notes will be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under Rule 144A,
but we have not and do not intend to list the Notes on any national securities exchange or include the Notes
in any automated quotation system. The initial purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend
to make a market in the Notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial purchasers
are not obligated to make a market in the Notes and, if commenced, may discontinue their market-making
activities at any time without notice.

Therefore, an active market for the Notes may not be maintained, which would adversely affect the
market price and liquidity of the Notes. In such case, the holders of the Notes may not be able to sell their
Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of
the Notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

   - changes in the overall market for high yield securities;

   - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

   - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

   - the number of holders of the Notes;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the Notes; and

   - prevailing interest rates.

Even if an active trading market for the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may
experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or
the prices at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may
trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for
similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_There are restrictions on the resale of the Notes._**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws. As a
result, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of,
U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws. Such exemptions include offers and sales
that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction and offers and sales to QIBs as defined under Rule 144A. U.S.
purchasers are advised to seek legal advice before reselling Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Notes are being offered in transactions that are not subject to, or are exempt from, the prospectus
requirements under applicable Canadian securities laws. Accordingly, the transfer or resale of the Notes will
be subject to restrictions under applicable Canadian securities laws and the terms of the Indenture, and


-----

any resale of the Notes must be made in accordance with those restrictions. A holder of the Notes may not
trade the Notes before the date that is four months and a day after the date of distribution of the Notes, unless
that trade is permitted under Canadian securities laws. Accordingly, to be made in accordance with
Canadian securities laws, any resale of the Notes must be made under available statutory exemptions from,
or in transactions not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws or under
a discretionary exemption granted by the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authority. Purchasers
are advised to seek legal advice before reselling the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in the Notes and may change._**

Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the Notes. Additionally, credit ratings
may not reflect the potential effect of risks related to the structure or marketing of the Notes. Real or
anticipated changes in the credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the Notes. We are under no
obligation to maintain any credit rating with credit rating agencies and there is no assurance that any
credit rating assigned to the Notes will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any rating will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the relevant rating agency.

A lowering, withdrawal or failure to maintain any credit ratings applied to the Notes may have an
adverse effect on the market price or value and the liquidity of the Notes and you may not be able to resell
your Notes without a substantial discount. In addition, any future lowering of our ratings likely would make
it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.

**_The market value of the Notes will fluctuate as prevailing interest rates change._**

Prevailing interest rates will affect the market value of the Notes, as they carry a fixed interest rate.
Assuming all other factors remain unchanged, the market value of the Notes will decline as prevailing
interest rates for comparable debt instruments rise, and increase as prevailing interest rates for comparable
debt instruments decline.

**_Bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring laws may impair the enforcement of rights or remedies under_**
**_the Notes._**

While GFL US is a Delaware corporation, GFL is an Ontario corporation governed by the laws of
Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein and a significant portion of our assets are
located across Canada and the U.S. and therefore either U.S. or Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency law
could apply in the event of our or GFL US’s receivership, bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring or that of
any of our or GFL US’s subsidiaries.

In the event that we become insolvent or are liquidated, a Noteholder’s rights to enforce remedies
under the Notes could be delayed or impaired by the restructuring provisions of applicable federal
bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought by us
or others with respect to us. For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) (“BIA”) and the
Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (“CCAA”) contain provisions enabling an “insolvent
person” to obtain a stay of proceedings against its creditors and others and to prepare and file a restructuring
proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement to be voted on by the various classes of its affected
creditors. A restructuring proposal, compromise or arrangement, if accepted by the requisite majorities of
each affected class of creditors, and if approved by the relevant Canadian court, would be binding on all
creditors within each affected class, including those that did not vote to accept the proposal, compromise
or arrangement. Furthermore, this legislation permits the insolvent person to retain possession and
administration of its property, subject to court oversight, even though that debtor may be in default under
the applicable debt instrument during the period the stay against proceedings remains in place.

In this regard, the approval threshold requirements provided in the Indenture for modification of
certain rights of the holders of Notes may be disregarded. In an insolvency or bankruptcy or similar
proceeding, the applicable statute or the court will establish the approval threshold. The approval threshold
requirements under the Indenture may also be disregarded in a restructuring by way of a court approved
arrangement under a Canadian corporate statute. Stays of proceedings have also been granted in connection
with these corporate debt restructurings.


-----

The powers of the court under the BIA, the CCAA in particular, and other Canadian bankruptcy,
insolvency and other restructuring legislation, have been exercised broadly to protect an entity attempting
to restructure its affairs from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict
whether payments under the Notes or the Note Guarantees would be made during any proceedings in
bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring or whether and to what extent holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs.

In addition, while GFL US is incorporated in Delaware, GFL and certain of the subsidiaries expected
to be Guarantors are incorporated or otherwise existing under the laws of Canada (or provinces thereof, as
the case may be). However, GFL US and certain of the subsidiaries expected to be Guarantors are
incorporated or otherwise existing under the laws of the United States and future subsidiaries that become
Guarantors, if any, may be formed or otherwise existing under the laws of the United States or another
jurisdiction outside of Canada, and/or their respective principal operating assets are or could be located in
such jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in
any of these jurisdictions. Under bankruptcy laws in the United States, courts typically have jurisdiction
over a debtor’s property, wherever located, including property situated in other countries. A Noteholder’s
rights under the Notes and the Note Guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and
courts in one jurisdiction may not recognize the jurisdiction of another court. Accordingly, difficulties
may arise in administering a bankruptcy case involving a Canadian debtor with assets located in the United
States, and any orders or judgments of a bankruptcy court in Canada or the United States may not be
enforceable in the other jurisdiction. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex
and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’
rights.

A judgment by a Canadian or other foreign court relating to any Note or to a Note Guarantee or
relating to the enforcement of a foreign judgment in respect of a Note or Note Guarantee may be awarded
only in Canadian currency or the relevant foreign local currency, as the case may be, and such judgment may
be based on a rate of exchange in existence on a day other than the day of payment.

The Note Guarantees provided will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New
York. A judgment by a U.S. court relating to the Note Guarantee or relating to the enforcement of a foreign
judgment in respect of the Note Guarantee may be awarded in U.S. currency and such judgment may be
based on a rate of exchange in existence on a day other than the day of payment.

Your rights under the Notes and Notes Guarantees will be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions,
and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar
proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors
and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, and other laws of the respective Guarantors’
jurisdictions of incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another and those
of the United States in certain areas, including creditors’rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in
multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes or Note Guarantees.

**_Investors in Notes may have difficulties enforcing certain civil liabilities._**

While GFL US is a Delaware corporation, GFL is incorporated under the laws of the Province of
Ontario and only certain of GFL US’s Guarantors are incorporated or otherwise exist under the laws of
the United States. Some of the controlling persons of GFL are residents of Canada, and certain of its
directors and officers, as well as certain of the experts named in this Offering Memorandum, are residents of
Canada, and all or a substantial portion of their assets and a significant portion of our assets are located
outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for holders of the Notes to effect service of process
within the United States upon Canadian Guarantors or the directors, officers and experts who are not
residents of the United States, or within Canada upon United States Guarantors or the directors, officers
and experts who are not residents of Canada, or to realize in one country upon judgments of courts of
another country predicated upon civil liability under federal, territorial or state securities laws or other laws of


-----

another jurisdiction. There are defenses that can be raised to the enforceability, in original actions in
Canadian courts, of liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or “blue sky” laws
of any state within the U.S. and to the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts
obtained in actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or
“blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S., such that the enforcement in Canada of such liabilities and
judgments is not certain. Therefore, it may not be possible to enforce those judgments against us, certain of
our directors and officers or some of the experts named in this Offering Memorandum. See “General Matters.”

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply during any period in which the Notes are rated investment_**
**_grade by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s._**

Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us during any period in which the Notes are
rated investment grade by both of Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, provided at such time no default or
event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to
pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the
Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will
maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain
transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force. To the extent the covenants
are subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in
a default or event of default under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_The Guarantors may be released upon the occurrence of certain events._**

A Guarantor will be released from its Note Guarantee upon the occurrence of certain events, including
the following:

   - the designation of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

   - the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor (including by
way of amalgamation, consolidation or merger) if such Guarantor does not survive such sale, or the
sale or issuance of a majority of the shares of such Guarantor to a third-party; or

   - the release or discharge of the Guarantor’s guarantee of its obligations under the Term Facility
(subject to certain exceptions).

If any such Guarantor is released, no holder of the Notes will have a claim as a creditor against any
such former Guarantor and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred
stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of such former Guarantor will be effectively senior to the claim
of any holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes.”

**_The lenders under the Term Facility will have the discretion to release Guarantors under the Term Facility in a_**
**_variety of circumstances, which will cause those Guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the Notes._**

So long as any obligations under the Term Facility remain outstanding, any Note Guarantees may be
released without action by, or consent of, any holder of Notes or the trustee under the Indenture if, at the
discretion of lenders under such Term Facility, such Guarantor’s guarantee of such Term Facility is released.
The lenders under such Term Facility will have the discretion to release the Guarantees under such Term
Facility in a variety of circumstances. Any Guarantors of the Notes that are released as guarantors under such
Term Facility will automatically be released as Guarantors of the Notes. You will not have a claim as a
creditor against any entity that is no longer a Guarantor of the Notes, and the indebtedness and other
liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of all released subsidiaries will effectively be senior to your claims
as a holder of the Notes.

**_This Offering Memorandum includes financial information derived from financial information prepared by_**
**_other entities, which our management cannot independently verify._**

We include in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information for previously acquired
businesses. Specifically, Run-Rate EBITDA includes our estimate of the results of each acquired business
based upon the respective number of months of its operation for the applicable period prior to the date of our


-----

acquisition. The historical financial information for such acquired businesses was prepared by the
management of such acquired entities, and in most instances such financial information has not been
prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, the requirements of Regulation S-X or any other accounting
or securities regulations relating to the presentation of pro forma financial information or audited or
reviewed by independent auditors. In most cases, we have not verified the other line items in such financial
statements. We cannot assure you that such pre-acquisition financial information of such acquired entities, or
of other companies we have acquired or will acquire, or that any information included or incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum that has been derived from such financial information, would not be
materially different if such information were prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, the
requirements of Regulation S-X or any other accounting or securities regulations relating to the presentation
of pro forma financial information and audited or reviewed by independent accountants.

**_This Offering Memorandum does not provide you with all of the information we would be required to provide_**
**_you with if this offering was being made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC or a prospectus_**
**_filed with the Canadian securities administrators._**

This Offering Memorandum does not contain all of the information that we would be required to
include in a registration statement filed with the SEC or in a prospectus filed with the Canadian securities
administrators for a public distribution of the Notes in Canada. No separate financial statements in respect
of any acquisitions we completed in Fiscal 2023 or Fiscal 2022 are included or incorporated by reference
in this Offering Memorandum. However, the financial results of the acquisitions completed in Fiscal 2023
and Fiscal 2022 have been consolidated into our audited consolidated financial statements from the respective
dates of each acquisition. Therefore, you will not be able to assess the financial position and results of
operations of the businesses acquired in such acquisitions on a standalone basis.

In this Offering Memorandum we incorporate by reference our audited consolidated financial statements
for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.

We cannot assure you that the financial information relating to the businesses acquired in the
acquisitions completed in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 for periods prior to the date of acquisition, or any
information included or incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum that has been derived from
such financial information, would not be materially different if such information had been prepared in
accordance with IFRS and audited or reviewed by independent accountants.

We regularly consider potential acquisition opportunities and may complete a number of acquisitions
in the near term. Some of these acquisitions may be considered significant under SEC rules. However, we
have not included any financial statements or any other information related to the businesses that may be
acquired pursuant to such acquisitions in this Offering Memorandum. Moreover, audited financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP or IFRS may not be available with respect to some or all of the
potential acquisitions.

**_Applicable statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the guarantees of the Notes._**

Our creditors or creditors of the Guarantors could challenge the Note Guarantees as fraudulent transfers,
conveyances or preferences or on other grounds under applicable Canadian federal or provincial law (or the
applicable laws of the jurisdiction of any future Guarantor). While the relevant laws vary from one
jurisdiction to another, the entering into of the Note Guarantees could be found to be a fraudulent transfer,
conveyance or preference or a transfer at undervalue or otherwise void, or the court could make an order
requiring the repayment of funds received if a court was to determine that, among other things:

   - the Note Guarantee was given or payment made with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud the
existing or future creditors of the Guarantor;

   - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration for the delivery of the Note Guarantee; or

   - the Guarantor was insolvent at the time it delivered the Note Guarantee or was rendered insolvent
by the giving of the Note Guarantee.

We cannot predict: (i) what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether a Guarantor
was insolvent as of the date it issued the Note Guarantee, or whether, regardless of the method of valuation,


-----

a court would determine that the Guarantor was insolvent on that date; or (ii) whether a court would
determine that the payments under the Note Guarantee constituted fraudulent transfers or conveyances on
other grounds.

To the extent a court voids a Note Guarantee as a fraudulent transfer, preference or conveyance or a
transfer at undervalue, or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, the applicable trustee and the holders
of the Notes would cease to have any direct claim against such Guarantor. If a court were to take this
action, the Guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the Guarantor’s liabilities, including trade
payables and preferred stock claims, if any, before any portion of its assets could be distributed to us to be
applied to the payment of the Notes. If a court were to conclude that a Note Guarantee should be
subordinated for equitable reasons to claims of other creditors of a Guarantor, then those other creditors
must be satisfied before any portion of the assets of that Guarantor would be available to satisfy its Note
Guarantee. We cannot assure you that a Guarantor’s remaining assets would be sufficient to satisfy the claims
of the holders of the Notes relating to any voided portions or subordinated portions of the Note
Guarantees.

In addition, the corporate statutes or other instruments governing the Guarantors may also have
provisions that serve to protect each Guarantor’s creditors from impairment of its capital from financial
assistance given to its affiliates where there are reasonable grounds to believe that, as a consequence of this
financial assistance, the Guarantor could be rendered insolvent or the book value, or in some cases the
realizable value, of its assets would be less than the sum of its liabilities and its issued and paid-up share
capital. While the applicable corporate laws may not prohibit financial assistance transactions and a
corporation is generally permitted flexibility in its financial dealings, the applicable corporate laws may
place restrictions on each Guarantor’s ability to give financial assistance in certain circumstances.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Notes offered hereby are US$500.0 million. We estimate that the net
proceeds to us from the Notes offered hereby, after payment of the initial purchasers’ fees and estimated
offering expenses, will be approximately $673.1 million, based on the applicable foreign exchange rate of
US$1.00 to $1.3635 as of June 3, 2024 (rounded). We intend to use the net proceeds from the Notes offered
hereby, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes and to
pay related fees, premiums and accrued and unpaid interest on such notes.

As of March 31, 2024, we had $677.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.250% 2025 Secured
Notes outstanding with an interest rate of 4.250% and a maturity date of June 1, 2025. We anticipate accrued
and unpaid interest payable on the 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes to be redeemed will be approximately
US$1.6 million on the redemption date.

Any redemption of the 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes will be made solely pursuant to a redemption
notice delivered in accordance with the indenture governing such 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes. Nothing
contained in this Offering Memorandum constitutes a notice of redemption of the 4.250% 2025 Secured
Notes.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

The US$500.0 million of % Senior Notes due 2032 offered hereby, which we refer to in this
“Description of Notes” as the “Notes,” will be issued by the Issuer (as defined below) pursuant to an
indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of, 2024, among the Issuer, the Guarantors and
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). As used in this section, references to the
“Issuer” mean Wrangler Holdco Corp. (“GFL US”), but not any of its Subsidiaries, references to “GFL”
mean GFL Environmental Inc., but not any of its Subsidiaries, and references to the “Company,” “we,” “us”
or “our” mean GFL and its Subsidiaries.

The Notes will be issued under the Indenture in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act. The Notes, together with any Additional Notes, will form a single series of
debt, and vote on any matter submitted to noteholders. The Notes will be issued subject to the transfer
restrictions described in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Transfer Restrictions.” When we refer
to the “Notes” in this section, we are referring to the Notes together with any Additional Notes referred to
below under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest,” unless the context otherwise requires.

The following summary does not purport to be a complete description of the Notes, the Indenture, the
Note Guarantees or such agreements and is subject to the detailed provisions of, and qualified in its entirety
by, reference to the Notes and the Indenture. We urge you to read these documents, because they, and not
this description, define your rights as Holders. You may obtain a copy of each document from the Issuer as
set forth below in “Available Information.”

The Notes will be issued in registered form, without coupons, and in minimum denominations of
US$2,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof. References to “US$” are to U.S. dollars and
to “$” are to Canadian dollars. The Notes will be denominated in U.S. dollars, and all payment on the
Notes will be made in U.S. dollars.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
holders will have rights under the Indenture.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be issued thereunder.
The Indenture provides that, subject to the covenants in the Indenture described below under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock” additional notes
(“Additional Notes”) may be issued thereunder from time to time, without the consent of the Holders of the
outstanding Notes, in an aggregate principal amount to be determined from time to time by the Issuer.
The terms of the Notes and any Additional Notes that may be subsequently issued under the Indenture will
be substantially identical other than the issuance dates. Because, however, any Additional Notes may not
be fungible with the Notes for federal income tax purposes, they may have a different CUSIP number or
numbers, be represented by a different Global Note or Global Notes, and otherwise be treated as a separate
class or classes of notes from the Notes for other purposes.

The Notes will mature on, 2032. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of %
per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on and of each year. The Issuer will
make each interest payment on the Notes to the Holders of record as of the close of business on
the and preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date. The initial Interest Payment Date for
the Notes offered hereunder will be, 2024. Solely for purposes of disclosure under the Interest Act
(Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which interest is calculated under a Note for any period in any
calendar year (the “Calculation Period”) is equivalent to the rate payable under a Note in respect of the
Calculation Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in such
calendar year and the denominator of which is the actual number of days in the Calculation Period.

Interest on the Notes offered hereunder will accrue from the date it was most recently paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant
Interest Payment Date.


-----

If an Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment to be made
on such Interest Payment Date will be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and
effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date, and no additional interest will accrue solely as a result of
such delayed payment. Interest on overdue principal and interest will accrue at the applicable interest rate
on the Notes.

**Note Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes will be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by GFL and all of GFL’s existing and future
Material Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that guarantee the obligations under the Term Loan
Credit Agreement.

Certain of GFL’s Subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes, and Note Guarantees may be released in
certain circumstances. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of such Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors, Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors will pay the holders of their debt and their
trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or any Guarantor. Certain
of GFL’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries are guarantors under the Existing Secured Notes, the Term Loan
Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement, so the Notes will be structurally subordinated to
Indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement with
respect to assets of any non-guarantor Subsidiaries.

As of the date hereof, all of GFL’s Subsidiaries are Restricted Subsidiaries. However, under the
circumstances described under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,” GFL is permitted to designate some of its Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries._
The effect of designating a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary is that:

   - the Unrestricted Subsidiary will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture;

   - the Unrestricted Subsidiary will be released from its Note Guarantee; and

   - the assets, income, cash flow and other financial results of the Unrestricted Subsidiary will not be
consolidated with those of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries for purposes of calculating compliance
with the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture.

A Guarantor will be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee upon the occurrence of
any of the following:

   - in the event of (i) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor,
by way of consolidation, merger, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise, to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary,
_provided that upon the completion of such sale or other disposition, such Guarantor ceases to exist, or_
(ii) a sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor such that it ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary, in the case of each of the foregoing subclauses (i) and (ii) to the extent that
such sale or other disposition is permitted under the Indenture;

   - the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor with respect to
its obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except a discharge or release by or a result of
payment under such guarantee or direct obligation;

   - if such Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture, upon the effectiveness of such designation;

   - upon payment in full in cash of the principal of, accrued and unpaid interest and premium (if any)
on, the Notes; or

   - upon the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance” or the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture otherwise being discharged in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture.


-----

**Ranking**

The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will be:

   - equal in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (including
Indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the
Existing Notes);

   - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

   - effectively junior to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of the Issuer, including Indebtedness
under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured
Notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness; and

   - structurally junior to all Indebtedness and other liabilities of any Subsidiary of GFL that is not a
Guarantor.

Each Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor and
will rank:

   - equal in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor
(including any Indebtedness or guarantee under the Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit
Agreement and the Existing Notes, as applicable);

   - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

   - effectively junior to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such
Guarantor’s Indebtedness or guarantee under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Revolving
Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing
such Indebtedness; and

   - structurally junior to all Indebtedness and other liabilities of any Subsidiary of GFL that is not a
Guarantor.

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Notes offered hereby and
the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds”:

   - we would have had outstanding approximately $9,191.4 million in aggregate principal amount of
Total Funded Debt (including the Notes);

   - we would have had remaining availability for revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Agreement of $813.2 million (after giving effect to utilization of $217.4 million in letters of credit);
and

   - we would have had outstanding $5,807.2 million of Secured Indebtedness.

As of March 31, 2024, GFL’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors collectively had:

   - liabilities of $595.2 million (4.7% of our consolidated total liabilities); and

   - assets of $1,018.9 million (5.1% of our consolidated total assets).

For Fiscal 2023, GFL’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors collectively generated revenue of $215.1
million and Adjusted EBITDA of $59.5 million, which includes intercompany transactions with GFL and
the Guarantors.

A significant portion of the operations of GFL are conducted through GFL’s Subsidiaries. Claims of
creditors of any Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors and creditors holding
Indebtedness or guarantees issued by such Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, and claims of preferred
stockholders of such Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors generally will have priority with respect to the
assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors over the claims of our creditors, including
Holders, even if such claims do not constitute senior Indebtedness. Accordingly, the Notes will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders, if any, of such
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a
Guarantor. See “Risk Factors.”


-----

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Trustee acts as paying agent and registrar for the Notes. The Issuer may change the paying agent
or registrar without prior notice to the Holders of the Notes, and GFL or any of its Subsidiaries may act as
paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all transfer taxes due on
transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or repurchase
(except in the case of a Note to be redeemed or repurchased in part, the portion not to be redeemed or
repurchased). Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days
before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or between a Record Date and the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each a “Payor”) under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for or on account of any present or future Taxes, unless such Payor is required to withhold or
deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If a Payor is so required to withhold
or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in
which such Payor is organized, resident or carrying on business for tax purposes or from or through which
such Payor makes any payment on the Notes or any Note Guarantee or any department or political subdivision
thereof (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) from any payment made under or with respect to the
Notes or any Note Guarantee, such Payor, subject to the exceptions stated below, will pay such additional
amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary such that the net amount received in respect of such
payment by each Holder or Beneficial Holder after such withholding or deduction (including withholding or
deduction attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder but excluding Taxes on net income) will
not be less than the amount the Holder or Beneficial Holder, as the case may be, would have received if such
Taxes had not been required to be so withheld or deducted.

A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or Beneficial Holder with respect to:

(i) Canadian withholding Taxes imposed on a payment by a Payor that is resident in Canada for
purposes of the Tax Act to a Holder or Beneficial Holder with which the Payor does not deal at
arm’s length for the purposes of the Tax Act at the time of making such payment (other than
where the non-arm’s length relationship arises as a result of the exercise or enforcement of rights
under any Notes or any Note Guarantee);

(ii) Canadian withholding Taxes imposed in respect of a debt or other obligation to pay an amount
to a person with whom the applicable Payor that is resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax
Act is not dealing at arm’s length within the meaning of the Tax Act (other than where the nonarm’s length relationship arises as a result of the exercise or enforcement of rights under any
Notes or any Note Guarantee);

(iii) any Canadian withholding Taxes imposed on a payment or deemed payment by a Payor that is
resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act to a Holder or Beneficial Holder by reason of such
Holder or Beneficial Holder being a “specified shareholder” of GFL (within the meaning of
subsection 18(5) of the Tax Act) at the time of payment or deemed payment, or by reason of such
Holder or Beneficial Holder not dealing at arm’s length for the purposes of the Tax Act with a
“specified shareholder” of GFL at the time of payment or deemed payment (other than where the
Holder or Beneficial Holder is a “specified shareholder,” or does not deal at arm’s length with a
“specified shareholder,”as a result of the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Notes or any
Note Guarantee);


-----

(iv) Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts that would not have been imposed but for the
existence of any present or former connection between such Holder (or the Beneficial Holder of,
or person ultimately entitled to obtain an interest in, such Notes, including a fiduciary, settler,
beneficiary, member, partner, shareholder or other equity interest owner of, or possessor of power
over, such Holder or Beneficial Holder, if such Holder or Beneficial Holder is an estate, trust,
partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction but not including
any connection resulting solely from the acquisition, ownership, or disposition of Notes, the
receipt of payments thereunder and/or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Notes or
any Note Guarantee);

(v) Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts that would not have been imposed but for the
failure of such Holder or Beneficial Holder, to the extent such Holder or Beneficial Holder is
legally eligible to do so, to timely satisfy any certification, identification, information,
documentation or other reporting requirements concerning such Holder’s or Beneficial Holder’s
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or arm’s
length relationship with the Payor or otherwise establish the right to the benefit of an exemption
from, or reduction in the rate of, withholding or deduction, if such compliance is required by
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such
Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification
that the Holder or Beneficial Holder is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(vi) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, excise or any similar Taxes or
assessment;

(vii) any Taxes that were imposed with respect to any payment on a Note to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment and to
the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed on such
payment had the Holder been the beneficiary, partner or sole beneficial owner, as the case may
be, of such Note;

(viii) Taxes imposed on, or deducted or withheld from, payments in respect of the Notes if such
payments could have been made without such imposition, deduction or withholding of such
Taxes had such Notes been presented for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days
after the date on which such payments or such Notes became due and payable or the date on
which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later (except to the extent such Holder
or Beneficial Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts had such Notes
been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(ix) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments made
under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(x) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of any Note for payment
by or on behalf of a Holder or Beneficial Holder who would have been able to avoid such
withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another paying agent;

(xi) any Taxes imposed by the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having power to tax;

(xii) any Taxes imposed under FATCA; or

(xiii) any combination of the foregoing items (i) through (xii).

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes
or any Note Guarantee is due and payable, if a Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior
to the date on which such payment is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Payor


-----

will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and
the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such
Additional Amounts to Holders and/or Beneficial Holders on the payment date.

The Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Holders and Beneficial Holders of the Notes for the
amount of any Taxes under Regulation 803 of the Tax Act, or any similar or successor provision (other
than Taxes described in clauses (i) through (xii) above (but including, notwithstanding clause (ix), any Taxes
payable pursuant to Regulation 803 of the Tax Act) or Taxes arising by reason of a transfer of the Note to
a person resident in Canada with whom the transferor does not deal at arm’s length for the purposes of the
Tax Act except where such non-arm’s length relationship arises as a result of the exercise or enforcement
of rights under any Notes or any Note Guarantee) levied or imposed on and paid by such a Holder or
Beneficial Holder as a result of payments made under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee.

In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentation, excise or other
similar taxes, charges and duties, including any interest, penalties and any similar liabilities with respect
thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution, issuance,
registration, delivery or enforcement of the Notes (other than on or in connection with a transfer of the Notes
other than the initial sale by the initial purchaser), any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument
referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
on any payments made pursuant to the Notes or any Note Guarantee and/or any other such document or
instrument (limited, solely in the case of taxes, charges or duties attributable to any payments with respect
thereto, to any such taxes, charges or duties imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded
under clauses (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (x) and (xi) above).

The obligations described under this heading will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of
the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to any Payor and to any jurisdiction
in which such successor is organized or is otherwise resident or doing business for tax purposes or any
jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by such successor or its respective agents. Whenever
this “Description of Notes” refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any
other amount payable under or with respect to any Note, such reference shall include the payment of
Additional Amounts or indemnification payments as described hereunder, if applicable.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to an
aggregate of 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including, for greater certainty, any Additional
Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a
redemption price (as calculated by the Issuer) equal to (i) % of the aggregate principal amount thereof,
with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings to the
extent such net cash proceeds are received by or contributed to the Issuer plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption, subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date falling on
or prior to the applicable date of redemption; provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture
on the Issue Date remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption
(but excluding any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date); and

(2) each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of any such Equity
Offering.

At any time prior to, 2027 the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a
part of the Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption, subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date falling on
or prior to the applicable date of redemption.


-----

On or after, 2027 the Issuer may, on any one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages
of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to,
but excluding, the applicable date of redemption, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date falling on or prior to the applicable
date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of the years
indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2027 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2028 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2029 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

In the event that Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer (as defined below),
Asset Sale Offer or other tender offer and the Issuer (or a third party making the offer) purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or third party offeror, as applicable, will
have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days
following the purchase pursuant to such offer described above, to redeem (in the case of the Issuer) or
purchase (in the case of a third party offeror) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a redemption price or purchase price, as the case may be, equal to the price paid to each other
Holder in such offer (which may be less than par) plus, to the extent not included in such price, accrued and
unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment
Date that is on or prior to the redemption date).

_Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases_

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes
as described under the captions “Offers to Repurchase—Change of Control Triggering Event” and “—Asset
_Sales.” GFL or any of its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates may at any time and from time to time acquire_
the Notes by means other than a redemption, whether pursuant to a tender offer, purchases in the open
market, by private purchase or otherwise.

_Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Tax_

If, as a result of:

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which is announced and becomes effective on
or after the Issue Date (or, where a jurisdiction in question does not become a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction until a later date, such later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, the existing official position or the introduction of an official
position regarding the application, interpretation, administration or assessing practices of any
such laws, regulations or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, or a judicial decision
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction (whether or not made, taken or reached with respect
to the Issuer or any of the Guarantors) which is announced and becomes effective on or after
the Issue Date (or, where a jurisdiction in question does not become a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
until a later date, such later date),

the Issuer or any Guarantor has become or will become obligated to pay, on the next date on which any
amount would be payable with respect to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, as applicable, Additional Amounts
or indemnification payments as described above under the heading “—Additional Amounts” with respect


-----

to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, which payment the Issuer or the Guarantor cannot avoid with the use
of reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a paying agent located in another
jurisdiction), then the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all but not less than all of the Notes, upon not
more than 60 days’ notice prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or a Guarantor, as applicable, would
be required to pay such Additional Amounts or indemnification payments, at a redemption price of 100%
of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Prior to the giving
of any notice of redemption described in this paragraph, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written
opinion of independent legal counsel to the Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, of recognized standing
to the effect that the Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, has or will become obligated to pay such Additional
Amounts or indemnification payments as a result of an amendment or change described above.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption
in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes
are listed (and the Issuer will notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if the Notes are not so listed, on a
_pro rata basis to the extent practicable or by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and_
appropriate (and, in a manner that complies with the requirements of DTC, if applicable).

Notes or portions of Notes the Trustee selects for redemption shall be in amounts equal to US$2,000
or a multiple of US$1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of redemption will be mailed by the Issuer by first class
mail (or sent electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC) at least 10 but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address,
except that redemption notices may be sent more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued
in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of, or any offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
given in connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event
that constitutes a Change of Control Triggering Event and prior to the completion or the occurrence
thereof, and any such redemption or purchase may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering,
transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject to satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable,
shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or purchase may be delayed until such time
(including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was mailed or
delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or
such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption or purchase date or by the redemption
or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s discretion
if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In
addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer that payment of the redemption or purchase price
and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be
performed by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible for monitoring, or charged with
knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the Notes eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed
or the actual amount of the Notes to be redeemed without notice thereof from the Issuer.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state
the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder of Notes upon
cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.
On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for
redemption so long as the Issuer has deposited with the Trustee funds in satisfaction of the applicable
redemption price (plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be redeemed).

If any redemption date is on or after a Record Date and on or before the related Interest Payment
Date, the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered
at the close of business on such Record Date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose
Notes shall be subject to redemption by the Issuer.


-----

**Offers to Repurchase**

_Change of Control Triggering Event_

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless, prior to, or
concurrently with, the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below), the
Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed or delivered, or otherwise sent through electronic transmission,
a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or
“—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the
offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”)
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Issuer may
determine) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment
Date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below).

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send notice of such
Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee sent in the same
manner, to each Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Repurchase
_at the Option of Holders—Change of Control Triggering Event,” and that all Notes properly_
tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than
60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided that
the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed, in the Issuer’s discretion, until such
time (including more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions
referred to in clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on
the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will
be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase”
on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of
DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to
the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the
Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration time of the Change of Control
Offer, an electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the
name of the Holder or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, the principal amount
of the Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its
tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued
new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion
of the Notes surrendered; provided that the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to
at least US$2,000 or an integral multiple of US$1,000 in excess of US$2,000;

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control
Triggering Event and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time as any or all


-----

such conditions (including the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event) shall be
satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that the Issuer shall determine that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied
or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as
so delayed; and

(9) such other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder
must follow.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of Notes through
the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with all applicable securities legislation in Canada and the United States
including, without limitation, the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the 1934 Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the
provisions of any applicable securities laws and regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with such laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer or its designated agent will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes accepted together with an Officer’s
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased
by the Issuer.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the paying agent will promptly transmit to each Holder of
Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn the Change of Control Payment for such tendered Notes, and
the Trustee, upon an order of the Issuer, will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by
book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount that is US$2,000 or an
integral multiple of US$1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the
Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after a Record Date and on or before the related Interest
Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered
at the close of business on such Record Date, and no other interest will be payable to Holders who tender
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture
are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer will not be required to make a
Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes an offer to
purchase the Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in substantial compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, or a notice of redemption
has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until
there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer by the Issuer or a third party may be made in advance of a


-----

Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control
Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of
Control Offer is made.

The Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be waived or modified before or after the occurrence of such Change of Control with the written
consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

Neither GFL nor the Issuer has a present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of
Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations
discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions,
refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event
under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or
otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit rating.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would
constitute a default under the Credit Agreements. Future Credit Facilities of the Issuer may contain
prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require
such Credit Facilities to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover,
the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default
under such Credit Facilities, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon
a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then-existing financial resources. There can be no assurance
that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the offer_
_required by the Indenture on a Change of Control Triggering Event or occurrence of certain asset sales.”_

The definition of Change of Control includes a reference to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of GFL and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established
definition of the reference under applicable law. Accordingly, whether or not the Issuer is required to offer
to repurchase Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the
assets of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

_Asset Sales_

GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale in
any single transaction or series of related transactions unless:

(1) GFL (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the
Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (measured as of the date of the definitive
agreement relating to such Asset Sale) of the assets, properties or Equity Interests issued, sold
or otherwise disposed of in such Asset Sale;

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received for such Asset Sale (measured at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), together with all Asset Sales since February 1, 2016
(on a cumulative basis) received by GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the manner referred to
in clause (1) above is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents, or Permitted Assets. For purposes
of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities of GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities or
liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee), as
shown on GFL’s most recent internally available annual or quarterly balance sheet, that are
(i) assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation
agreement or similar agreement that releases GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary from
further liability or (ii) otherwise canceled;


-----

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations (including earn-outs and similar obligations)
received by GFL or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are, within
180 days of the applicable Asset Sale, converted by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that
conversion;

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that GFL and its other Restricted Subsidiaries are
released from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the
Asset Sale; and

(d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value (with the Fair Market Value of
such item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time of
contractually agreeing to the related Asset Sale), taken together with all other Designated
Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $90.0 million and (ii) 3.0% of Total Assets
measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale.

Within 455 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (or, at the Issuer’s option, any
earlier date), GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary may apply those Net Proceeds for any combination of the
following purposes:

(1) to Repay Indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement
and/or any other Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien (other than any such Indebtedness that
is subordinate in right of payment to the Notes or any Note Guarantee);

(2) to Repay (a) obligations under the Notes, (b) other Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that if the
Issuer or any Guarantor shall so reduce obligations under other Pari Passu Indebtedness
pursuant to this clause (b), the Issuer will equally and ratably reduce obligations in respect of
the Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” or through open-market purchases (which
may be below par) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below
for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof (or, in the event that the Notes were issued with significant original issue
discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the pro rata
principal amount of Notes or (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor,
in each case other than Indebtedness owed to GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL;

(3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or to acquire Capital Stock of, a Person that is
engaged in a Permitted Business and that, in the case of an acquisition of Capital Stock, is or
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL;

(4) to make a capital expenditure; or

(5) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under GAAP and that are used or
useful in a Permitted Business or that replace, in whole or in part, the properties or assets that
are subject to the Asset Sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries enters into a
binding agreement committing to make an acquisition, expenditure or investment in compliance with
clauses (3), (4) or (5) above within 455 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (an
“Acceptable Commitment”), such commitment will be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds
from the date of the execution of such agreement until the earlier of (i) the date on which such acquisition
or investment is consummated or such expenditure made or such agreement is terminated, and (ii) the 180th
day after the expiration of the aforementioned 455-day period; provided that if any Acceptable Commitment
is later canceled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds
shall constitute Excess Proceeds from and after the date of such cancelation or termination; unless GFL or
such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment within 180 days of such cancellation
or termination (a “Second Commitment”) in which case such commitment will be treated as a permitted


-----

application of the Net Proceeds from the date of the execution of such agreement until the earlier of (i) the
date on which such acquisition or investment is consummated or such expenditure made or such agreement
is terminated, and (ii) the 180th day after the date of the Second Commitment.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer or GFL may temporarily reduce revolving
credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding
paragraphs (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase
Notes, as described in clause (2) above, will be deemed to have been so applied whether or not such offer is
accepted) will constitute “Excess Proceeds.”

If the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $60.0 million, the Issuer will make a pro rata offer
(an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of Notes (and, at the option of the Issuer, to holders of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as
the case may be, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will
be equal to 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as the case may be, issued with a significant original issue discount) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, to be
purchased on a pro rata basis (subject to the procedures of the relevant depositary), on the basis of the
aggregate principal amounts (or accreted values) tendered in round denominations (which, in the case of the
Notes, will be minimum denominations of US$2,000 principal amount and multiples of US$1,000 in
excess thereof). If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may
use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. Upon completion of
each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing
obligations with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with
respect to such Net Cash Proceeds at any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing
to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds before the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds $60.0 million.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or
otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the
amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount,
“Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture.

If the Asset Sale Offer purchase date is after the taking of a record of the Holders on a Record Date
and on or before the related Interest Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the
Person in whose name a purchased Note is registered on such Record Date, and no other interest will be
payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

The Issuer will comply with all applicable securities legislation of Canada and the United States,
including, without limitation, the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the 1934 Act and any other applicable
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
applicable securities laws and regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer
will comply with such laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified before or after the
occurrence of an Asset Sale with the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding. Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, any sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of GFL and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, will be
governed by the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Certain Covenants—Amalgamation, Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets” and will not be subject to the provisions described above in this section_
entitled “—Asset Sales.”


-----

**Certain Covenants**

_Covenant Suspension_

If on any date following the Issue Date:

(1) the Notes are rated Investment Grade by any two Approved Rating Organizations; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

(the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (1) and (2) being collectively referred to as a
“Covenant Suspension Event”) then, beginning on that day and at all times thereafter until the Reinstatement
Date (“Suspension Period”), and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants
specifically listed under the following captions in this Offering Memorandum will be suspended:

(1) “—Offers to Repurchase—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”;

(4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption
“—Amalgamation, Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(6) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and

(7) “—Issuance of Note Guarantees”,

(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”). During any Suspension Period, the Board of Directors of GFL
may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described
below under the caption “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”

In the event that GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for
any period of time as a result of the preceding paragraph and, on a subsequent date, at least one of the
Approved Rating Organizations which rates the Notes withdraws its Investment Grade rating, or downgrades
the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade rating, or ceases to rate the Notes (in each
case, such date, the “Reinstatement Date”), then GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries will after the
Reinstatement Date again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events for the
benefit of the Notes.

On the Reinstatement Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the
Suspension Period will be subject to the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock.” To the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock_
would not be so permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to such covenant, such Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (4) of the second paragraph of such covenant.

Calculations made after the Reinstatement Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under the covenant described below under the caption “—Restricted Payments” will be made as
though such covenant had been in effect from the Issue Date and throughout the Suspension Period.
Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to
be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption
“—Restricted Payments” to the extent provided therein.

For purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
_Restricted Subsidiaries,” on the Reinstatement Date, any contractual encumbrances or restrictions of the_
type specified in clauses (1), (2) or (3) of the first paragraph of that covenant entered into (or which GFL or
any Restricted Subsidiary of GFL became legally obligated to enter into) during the Suspension Period


-----

will be deemed to have been in effect on the Issue Date, so that they are permitted under clause (1) of the
second paragraph of that covenant.

For purposes of the covenant described under “—Offers to Repurchase—Asset Sales,” on the
Reinstatement Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero.

For purposes of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” any contract, agreement,
loan, advance or guarantee with or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of GFL entered into (or which GFL or
any Restricted Subsidiary of GFL became legally obligated to enter into) during the Suspension Period will
be deemed to have been in effect as of the Issue Date for purposes of clause (5) of the second paragraph
of such covenant.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated:

(1) no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of a failure to
comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or on the Reinstatement
Date) or after the Suspension Period based solely on events that occurred during the Suspension
Period; and

(2) neither (a) the continued existence, after the Reinstatement Date, of facts and circumstances or
obligations that were incurred or otherwise came into existence during a Suspension Period nor
(b) the performance of any such obligations, shall constitute a breach of any covenant set
forth in the Indenture or cause a Default or Event of Default thereunder; provided that (1) GFL
and its Restricted Subsidiaries did not incur or otherwise cause such facts and circumstances
or obligations to exist in anticipation of the Notes ceasing to be rated Investment Grade, and
(2) the Issuer reasonably believed that such incurrence or actions would not result in such ceasing.

_Restricted Payments_

GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of GFL’s or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, in connection
with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation involving GFL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of GFL’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’
Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than (i) dividends or distributions payable in
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL, or in warrants, options or other rights
to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL, and (ii) dividends or
distributions payable to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries);

(2) purchase, retract, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation,
in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation involving GFL), in whole or in
part, any Equity Interests of GFL (other than any such Equity Interests owned by GFL or a
Restricted Subsidiary);

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or
retire for value any Subordinated Indebtedness, except for (i) a payment of interest at the Stated
Maturity thereof or of principal not earlier than one year prior to the Stated Maturity thereof
and (ii) any such Indebtedness owed to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1)
through (4) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”) unless, at the time of
and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(a) in the case of a Restricted Payment other than a Restricted Investment, no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted
Payment and in the case of a Restricted Investment, no Event of Default described
under clause (1), (2), (6), (9) or (10) under the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and
_Remedies” has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;_


-----

(b) GFL would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect
thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable fourquarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”; and_

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries after February 1, 2016 (other than
pursuant to clauses (3) through (18) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the
sum, without duplication, of:

(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income for the period (taken as one accounting
period) from February 1, 2016 to the end of GFL’s most recently ended fiscal
quarter for which internal annual or quarterly financial statements are available at
the time of such Restricted Payment or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such
period is a loss, less 100% of such loss (which amount in this clause (i) may not
be less than zero); plus

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by GFL since February 1, 2016
(A) as a contribution to its common equity capital, (B) from the issue or sale of
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL, (C) from the issue or sale of
warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified
Stock) of GFL, and (D) from the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable
Disqualified Stock of t GFL or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of GFL,
in each case that have been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock (other
than Disqualified Stock) of GFL or warrants, options or other rights to acquire
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL (in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (A) through (D), other than (1) a contribution from, or Capital
Stock, Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to, a Subsidiary of GFL) or
(2) Excluded Contributions; plus

(iii) 100% of the Fair Market Value of property other than cash received by GFL since
February 1, 2016 in consideration of (or in exchange for) its Capital Stock (other
than Disqualified Stock); plus

(iv) 100% of the principal amount of any Indebtedness, or the liquidation preference
or maximum fixed repurchase price, as the case may be, of any Disqualified Stock
of GFL issued after February 1, 2016 (other than Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock
issued to a Restricted Subsidiary) which has been converted into or exchanged for
Capital Stock of GFL (other than Disqualified Stock); plus

(v) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after February 1, 2016
is (A) sold for cash or otherwise cancelled, liquidated, or repaid for cash, or (B) in the
case of a Restricted Investment constituting a guarantee, released, the initial
amount of such Restricted Investment (or, if less, in the case of a sale, cancellation,
liquidation or repayment for cash described in the foregoing subclause (A), the
amount of cash received upon such sale, cancellation, liquidation or repayment), in
each case, to the extent that any such payments or proceeds are not already
included in Consolidated Net Income of GFL for the applicable period; provided,
for certainty, that any amount that would otherwise be included in this clause (v) as
a result of the release of a guarantee due to the payment thereunder by GFL or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such
payments; plus

(vi) upon a redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, the
lesser of (A) the Fair Market Value of GFL’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’
Investments in such Subsidiary as at the date of such redesignation and (B) the
Fair Market Value of such Investments at the date on which such Subsidiary was
originally designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; plus


-----

(vii) 100% of any dividends or distributions received in cash by GFL or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries from any Unrestricted Subsidiary after February 1, 2016,
to the extent not already included in Consolidated Net Income of GFL for the
applicable period; plus

(viii) 100% of the aggregate amount of Retained Declined Proceeds.

As of March 31, 2024, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (c) was
approximately $6,869.3 million.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment by GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary of any dividend or distribution, or the
consummation of any irrevocable redemption of any Subordinated Indebtedness, within 60 days
after the date of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the giving of the notice of
redemption, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice the dividend or distribution
or redemption of such Subordinated Indebtedness would have been permitted by the Indenture;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the Net Cash Proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of GFL) of, Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock) of GFL or warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock
(other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL; provided that the amount of any such Net Cash Proceeds
that are utilized for any such Restricted Payment will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the
preceding paragraph;

(3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor with the net cash proceeds from a substantially
concurrent incurrence of, or in exchange for, any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) the declaration and payment of any dividend or other distribution by a Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary to the holders of its Capital Stock on a pro rata
basis;

(5) the purchase, repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of Equity
Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise or exchange of stock options, warrants or other
convertible securities if the Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise or exchange price
thereof and repurchases or other acquisitions or retirement for value of Equity Interests

to an employee to pay for the taxes payable by such employee either upon such grant or award or
in connection with any such exercise or exchange of stock options, warrants or other convertible
securities;

(6) the payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or other retirement for

change of control at a purchase or redemption price no greater than 101% of the principal
amount of such Subordinated Indebtedness, plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, or
(b) in the event of an asset sale at a purchase or redemption price no greater than 100% of the
principal amount of such Subordinated Indebtedness, plus any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, in each case, in accordance with provisions similar to the covenants described under
“—Offers to Repurchase—Change of Control Triggering Event” or “—Asset Sales” as applicable;
_provided, however, that, prior to or simultaneously with such payment, purchase, repurchase,_
redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement, the Issuer has made the Change of Control
Offer or Asset Sale Offer, if required, with respect to the Notes and has repurchased all Notes
validly tendered for payment and not withdrawn in connection with such Change of Control Offer
or Asset Sale Offer;

(7) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of any Equity Interests of GFL or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries held by any current or former officer, director, employee or consultant (or
their transferees, estates or beneficiaries) of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant


-----

to any equity subscription agreement, shareholder agreement, employment agreement, stock
option plan, equity incentive or other plan or similar agreement, in each case in effect as of the
Issue Date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $70.0 million and (y) 1.5% of
Total Assets in each calendar year of GFL (with unused amounts in any calendar year being
carried over to the immediately succeeding three calendar years); provided, that such amount in
any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed:

(a) the cash proceeds received by GFL from the sale of Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock) of GFL or any direct or indirect parent of GFL (to the extent
contributed to GFL) to employees, directors, officers or consultants of GFL or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any direct or indirect parent of GFL that occurs after
February 1, 2016 (it being understood that the amount of such cash proceeds utilized for
any such repurchase, retirement, other acquisition or dividend will not increase the
amount available for Restricted Payments under clause (3) of the preceding paragraph),
plus

Restricted Subsidiary from any present or former employees, directors, officers or
consultants of GFL, any Restricted Subsidiary or the direct or indirect parents of GFL

covenant or any other provision of the Indenture;

(8) the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of any class

connection with the exercise of warrants, options or other securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Equity Interests of such Persons; and

(viii) for any taxable period for which GFL and/or any of its Subsidiaries are members of a
consolidated, combined or similar income Tax group for Tax purposes of which a direct
or indirect parent of GFL is the common parent (a “Tax Group”), the proceeds of which
are necessary to permit the common parent of such Tax Group to pay the portion of
any income Tax of such Tax Group for such taxable period that is attributable to the
income of GFL and/or its Subsidiaries; provided that (A) the amount of such Restricted
Payments for any taxable period shall not exceed that amount of such Taxes that GFL
and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, would have paid had GFL and/or its applicable
Subsidiaries, as applicable, been a stand-alone taxpayer (or a stand-alone group) for all
applicable tax years and (B) the amount of such Restricted Payments in respect of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be permitted only to the extent that cash distributions were
made by such Unrestricted Subsidiary to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for
such purpose; provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted
Payment made in reliance on clause (15), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, if a proposed Restricted Payment or
Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in
clauses (1) through (18) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer may, in
its sole discretion, divide and classify (or later reclassify in whole or in part, from time to time in its sole
discretion) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1) through (18)
and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” in any manner that complies with this covenant. For the purposes of determining compliance
with any Canadian dollar or other currency denominated restriction on Restricted Payments denominated
in a foreign currency, the Canadian dollar or other currency-equivalent amount of such Restricted Payment
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date that such Restricted
Payment was made. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of
Restricted Payments that GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may make pursuant to this covenant
shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

The amount of each Restricted Payment (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by GFL or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant will not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up
payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of GFL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock_

GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise,
with respect to (in any such case, “incur”) any Indebtedness, and GFL will not issue any shares of Disqualified


-----

Stock or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock; provided, however, that GFL may incur Indebtedness or issue shares of Disqualified Stock (in each
case, including Acquired Indebtedness) and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (in each case,
including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, if immediately
after and giving effect thereto, either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for GFL’s most recently ended four
full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on
which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would
have been not less than 2.0 to 1.0, or (y) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to
6.75:1.00, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or such Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided that
Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including a pro forma application
of the net proceeds therefrom) the amount of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors that would be outstanding pursuant to this paragraph would exceed in aggregate the greater of
(i) $45.0 million and (ii) 1.5% of Total Assets.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of
Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities
(with letters of guarantee, tender checks and letters of credit being deemed to have a principal
amount equal to the maximum potential liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
thereunder) not to exceed the sum of (i) the greater of (x) $4,350.0 million and (y) the maximum
amount such that after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional Indebtedness
and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio
of GFL would be no greater than 5.50 to 1.00 plus (ii) the greater of (x) $400.0 million and (y) 100%
of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters for which
internal annual or quarterly financial statements are available calculated in a manner consistent
with any pro forma adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA set forth in the definition of Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, at any one time outstanding; provided that for the purposes of
determining the amount that can be incurred under clause (i)(y) hereof all Indebtedness incurred
under clauses (i)(y) shall be deemed to be Secured Indebtedness;

(2) Indebtedness incurred under Credit Facilities or otherwise in connection with one or more
standby letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, completion guarantees, performance bonds, bid
bonds, appeal bonds or surety bonds or other similar reimbursement obligations, in each case,
issued in the ordinary course of business (including for the purpose of providing security for
environmental reclamation obligations to government agencies, workers’ compensation claims,
payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar statutory and other requirements)
and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of an advance or credit;

(3) the incurrence by the Issuer of Indebtedness represented by the Notes issued on the Issue Date
and the incurrence by the Guarantors of the Note Guarantees;

(4) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness or Attributable
Debt (including obligations represented by Financing Lease Obligations or Purchase Money
Obligations), in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase
price or cost of design, lease, expansion, construction, maintenance, upgrade, installation,
development, improvement, replacement or repair of property (real or personal), plant or
equipment or other assets used in the business of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Equity Interests of any Person owning such
assets, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount, including all outstanding Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed the greater of (i) $145.0 million and (ii) 5.0% of Total
Assets as of any date of incurrence (after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and
the application of the proceeds therefrom);


-----

(5) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness and
any guarantees with respect thereto;

(6) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance,
replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness between or
among GFL and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) that was incurred in reliance on the first
paragraph of this covenant or clauses (3), (4), (5), (6) or (12) of the definition of Permitted Debt;

(7) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness
between or among GFL and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such
Indebtedness being held by a Person other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL;
and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either GFL or
a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of
such Indebtedness by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was
not permitted by this clause (7);

(8) the issuance of preferred stock by any Restricted Subsidiary of GFL to GFL or to any other
Restricted Subsidiary of GFL; provided, however, that

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred
stock being held by a Person other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either GFL
or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence
of such Indebtedness by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that
was not permitted by this clause (8);

(9) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations in the
ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes;

(10) the guarantee by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness of GFL or a
Restricted Subsidiary that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant
(including, for greater certainty, Note Guarantees in respect of Additional Notes so permitted to
be incurred); provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated in right of
payment to or pari passu in right of payment with the Notes or any of the Note Guarantees,
then the guarantee must be subordinated in right of payment or pari passu in right of payment
to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;

(11) Indebtedness of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries arising (i) from the honoring by a
bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against
insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business or (ii) in connection with endorsement of
instruments for deposit in the ordinary course of business;

(12) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Cash Management Obligations
in the ordinary course of business;

(13) the incurrence of (1) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock (i) of GFL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries Incurred or assumed in connection with an acquisition of any assets (including
Capital Stock), business or Person or Investment and (ii) of any Person that is acquired by GFL
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or merged into or consolidated or amalgamated with
GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
(2) Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock issued or, in each case, assumed in anticipation
of, or in connection with, an acquisition of any assets, business or Person; provided, that after
giving effect to such acquisition, merger, consolidation or amalgamation and the incurrence of
such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, either (a) (i) GFL would be permitted to incur at least


-----

$1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in
the first paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is equal to or greater
than immediately prior to such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or to such merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or acquisition; or (b) (i) GFL would be permitted to incur at least
$1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio test set
forth in the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of GFL
and its Restricted Subsidiaries is equal to or less than immediately prior to such Investment,
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(14) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable), including all Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to this clause (14), not to exceed the greater of (i) $240.0 million and (ii) 60% of
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters for which internal
annual or quarterly financial statements are available calculated in a manner consistent with any
_pro forma adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio;

(15) Indebtedness consisting of (i) the financing of insurance premiums in an amount not to exceed,
at any time outstanding, the greater of (a) $30.0 million and (b) 1.0% of Total Assets determined
at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness (after giving effect to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom) or (ii) take-or-pay obligations
contained in supply arrangements, in each case, in the ordinary course of business;

(16) additional Indebtedness of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries to fund an acquisition or
Investment in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the greater
of (a) $130.0 million and (b) 4.0% of Total Assets determined at the time of incurrence of such
Indebtedness (after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of
the proceeds therefrom); provided that no Event of Default shall be continuing at the time the
relevant agreement with respect to such acquisition or Investment is entered into;

(17) Indebtedness incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor which, when aggregated
with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (17) and
then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of (i) $45.0 million and (ii) 1.5% of Total Assets
determined at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness (after giving effect to the incurrence of
such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom); and

(18) Contribution Indebtedness.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock” covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more
than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (2) through (18) above, or is
entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be permitted
to divide and classify (or later redivide and reclassify in whole or in part) such item of
Indebtedness in whole or in part in any manner that complies with this covenant, including by
allocation to more than one other type of Indebtedness, except that Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreements that is outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on
such date under clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt above and may not be reclassified,
other than within such clause (1). Amounts incurred under clause (ii) of the above clause (1) of
Permitted Debt, may, and will automatically be, reclassified into clause (i) thereof to the extent of
the availability under such clause (i);

(2) at the time of incurrence, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness
in more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in the first paragraph of this
covenant or clauses (2) through (18) above (or any portion thereof) without giving pro forma


-----

effect to the Indebtedness incurred pursuant to any other provision of this covenant when
calculating the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to any such clause or
paragraph;

(3) the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once,
and any obligations arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument
supporting such Indebtedness shall not be double counted;

(4) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of any Person (i) existing at the time such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary of GFL or is merged into, amalgamated with or consolidated with GFL
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (ii) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets
from such Person (any Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock described in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), “Acquired Indebtedness”) shall be deemed to have been incurred or issued by
a Restricted Subsidiary at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that
any such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock that is redeemed, defeased, retired or otherwise
repaid at the time of or immediately upon the consummation of the transaction by which
such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL (or is merged into, amalgamated with or
consolidated with GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be) will be deemed
not to have been incurred or issued for the purposes of this covenant;

(5) the accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock,
as applicable, with the same, or less onerous, terms (as determined in good faith by the Issuer),
the reclassification of preferred stock of the Issuer or any Guarantor as Indebtedness due to a
change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends or the making of any
distribution on Disqualified Stock or preferred stock in the form of additional shares of the
same class of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the accrual of dividends on Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an Issuance
of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are incurred pursuant to Credit Facilities and are
being treated as incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph above and the letters of
credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness will not constitute Indebtedness
for purposes of this covenant; and

(7) in the event that GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including
letters of guarantee, tender checks and letters of credit thereunder) may be determined, at the
election of the Issuer, on the date of such revolving credit facility or on the date of such increase
in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date),
and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and including letters of guarantee, tender checks and
letters of credit thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or and including letters of guarantee,
tender checks or letters of credit thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or
reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a
date pursuant to the operation of this paragraph shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”
as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Canadian dollar or other currency denominated
restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Canadian dollar or other currency-equivalent principal
amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or


-----

first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower Canadian dollar or other currency-equivalent),
in the case of revolving credit borrowings. However, if the Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable Canadian
dollar or other currency denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Canadian dollar or other currency denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced (except to the extent
necessary to pay all fees, defeasance costs, expenses and premiums (including tender premiums) incurred in
connection therewith).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that
GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded,
with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred
in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect
on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any additional Indebtedness (including Permitted
Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of such Person
unless such additional Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or
the applicable Note Guarantee, as the case may be, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no
Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness
solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis.

_Liens_

GFL will not, and will not permit the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien upon or with respect to any
of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, securing Indebtedness, unless:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and the Note Guarantees
are secured by a Lien on such property or assets that is senior in priority to such Liens (for as long
as such Indebtedness is so secured);

(2) in all other cases, the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property or
assets equally and ratably with the obligation or liability secured by such Liens (for as long as
such Indebtedness is so secured); or

(3) such Lien is a Permitted Lien.

_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_

GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to GFL or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or pay any Indebtedness owed to GFL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries; provided that the priority of any preferred stock over common stock in receiving
dividends or distributions (upon a liquidation or otherwise) shall not be deemed a restriction on
the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock;

(2) make loans or advances to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (it being understood that
the subordination of loans or advances made to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to other
Indebtedness incurred by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be deemed a
restriction on the ability to make loans or advances); or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries.


-----

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by
reason of:

(1) agreements or instruments (including agreements governing Existing Indebtedness or Credit
Facilities) as in effect or which came into effect on the Issue Date;

(2) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees;

(3) applicable law, rule, regulation, order, approval, license or permit;

(4) any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by
GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the
extent such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred or issued in connection with or in
contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any
Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets
of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock,
such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be
incurred or issued, as the case may be;

(5) customary non-assignment and non-subletting provisions in contracts, leases and licenses
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(6) agreements relating to Purchase Money Obligations, Financing Lease Obligations and Sale and
Lease-Back Transactions that impose restrictions on the property relating thereto of the nature
described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

(7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of assets or Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of GFL that restricts transfers of such assets or the making by that Restricted
Subsidiary of distributions, loans or advances pending such sale or other disposition;

(8) Permitted Liens that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(9) provisions in joint venture agreements, partnership agreements, limited liability company
agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business or with the approval of the Board of Directors of GFL or
the applicable Restricted Subsidiary of GFL, that limit the disposition or distribution of assets
or property, which limitations are applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such
agreements (including restrictions on the transfer of ownership interests in any joint venture,
partnership, limited liability company or other applicable entity);

(10) restrictions on cash, Cash Equivalents or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(11) encumbrances and restrictions contained in contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the aggregate,
detract from the value of, or from the ability of GFL and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
realize the value of, property or assets of GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material
to GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(12) agreements encumbering or restricting cash or marketable securities to secure Hedging
Obligations;

(13) agreements governing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”;
_provided that GFL determines in good faith, on the date of incurrence thereof, that the restrictions_
therein will not materially adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to make required principal
and interest payments on the Notes;


-----

(14) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive (taken as
a whole), than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;
and

(15) any amendments, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings (collectively, “refinancings”) of the agreements, instruments or obligations referred
to in clauses (1) through (14) above; provided that such refinancings are not materially more
restrictive (taken as a whole) with respect to such encumbrances and restrictions than those in
effect prior to such refinancings, as determined in good faith by the Issuer.

_Amalgamation, Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_

Neither the Issuer nor GFL may, in any transaction or series of transactions: (1) amalgamate, merge or
consolidate with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer or GFL is the surviving Person); or (2) sell,
assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of
GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person;
unless:

(1) either (a) the Issuer or GFL is the surviving entity; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any
such amalgamation, merger or consolidation (if other than the Issuer or GFL) or to which
such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is a Person
organized or existing under the laws of Canada or any province thereof or the United States,
any state of the United States or the District of Columbia (in each of clauses (a) and (b), GFL,
the Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer or GFL) assumes all the obligations of the
Issuer or GFL under the Notes and the Indenture either by operation of law or pursuant to an
assumption agreement or other instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction or series of transactions, and giving pro forma effect to any
related financing transactions, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period,
either (a) GFL or the Successor Company (if other than GFL), will be permitted to incur at
least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test
or the Total Net Leverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described
above under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock” or
(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is equal to or greater than it was immediately prior
thereto or (y) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would be equal to or less than the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of GFL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer or GFL, as applicable, has delivered to the Trustee (i) an opinion of counsel stating
that such transaction and, if an assumption agreement or other instrument is required in
connection with such transaction, such assumption agreement or other instrument complies
with clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant, and (ii) an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions
precedent contained in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, GFL or the Issuer under the Indenture
and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as applicable, and GFL or the Issuer will automatically be released and
discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4),

(1) any Subsidiary of GFL may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to GFL or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; and


-----

(2) GFL may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into an Affiliate of GFL solely for the
purpose of reincorporating GFL in Canada or any province thereof or the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia.

A Subsidiary Guarantor may not, in any transaction or series of transactions: (1) amalgamate,
consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving
Person); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to another Person, other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL (in the case of
either (1) or (2) above), unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, and giving pro forma effect to any related
financing transactions, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(2) either:

(a) (x) such Guarantor is the surviving entity or (y) the Person acquiring the property in any
such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition or the Person formed
by or surviving any such amalgamation, merger or consolidation assumes all the obligations
of that Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, either by operation of law or pursuant to
an assumption agreement or other instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (in
each of clauses (x) and (y), such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein
called the “Successor Person”); or

(b) such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under “Offers to Repurchase—Asset Sales”; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee (i) an opinion of counsel stating that such transaction
and, if an assumption agreement or other instrument is required in connection with such
transaction, such assumption agreement or other instrument complies with clause (2)(a) of this
covenant and (ii) an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent contained in the
Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with.

The Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the
Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Note Guarantee and such Subsidiary Guarantor will
automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Subsidiary
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor may (i) merge,
consolidate or amalgamate with or into an Affiliate of GFL solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing the Subsidiary Guarantor in Canada or any province thereof or the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, (ii) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability company, trust or other entity organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
organization of such Subsidiary Guarantor or a jurisdiction in Canada or any province thereof or the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia or (iii) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal
form if the Board of Directors of GFL or the senior management of GFL determines in good faith that such
action is in the best interests of GFL and is not materially disadvantageous to the Holders, in each case,
without regard to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph.

For purposes of this covenant, transfers among or between GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be
disregarded.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially
all” of the property or assets of a Person.

_Transactions with Affiliates_

GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets
from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or


-----

guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of GFL (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate consideration in excess of $20.0 million for any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions, unless:

(a) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to GFL or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that would reasonably be expected
to have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time by GFL or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, in an arm’s-length dealing with a Person who is not an Affiliate
of GFL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of $40.0 million, GFL delivers to the Trustee a resolution of
the Board of Directors of GFL set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate
Transaction or series of Affiliate Transactions, as the case may be, complies with this covenant
and that such Affiliate Transaction or series of Affiliate Transactions, as the case may be, has
been approved in good faith by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of GFL.

The following items will be deemed not to be Affiliate Transactions and therefore will not be subject to
the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any consulting or employment agreement or arrangement, employee or director compensation,
stock option, bonus, benefit or other similar plan, officer or director indemnification, insurance,
severance or expense reimbursement arrangement, or any similar arrangement existing on the
Issue Date or thereafter entered into by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business and payments and other benefits (including bonuses and retirement, severance,
health, stock option, restricted share, stock appreciation right, phantom right, profit interest,
equity incentive and other benefit plans) pursuant thereto;

(2) (a) transactions between or among GFL and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries (or an entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) and (b) any merger or
consolidation of GFL or any other direct or indirect parent of GFL; provided that such parent
entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets (other than cash, Cash Equivalents
and the Capital Stock of GFL) and such merger or consolidation is otherwise in compliance
with the terms of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide business purpose;

(3) transactions in which GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to
the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to
GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (a) of the preceding paragraph;

(4) payments, loans, advances or guarantees (or cancellation of loans, advances or guarantees) to
employees, officers, directors, managers, consultants or independent contractors for bona fide
business purposes or in the ordinary course of business;

(5) the issuance or sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL or warrants, options
or other rights to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL to, or the receipt
by GFL of any capital contribution from, its shareholders or Affiliates;

(6) Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under
the caption “—Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments (except for Investments made
in reliance on clauses (3), (5) and (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments);

(7) any agreement or arrangement described in the Offering Memorandum and to which GFL or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party as of or on the Issue Date, or as such agreement or
arrangement is thereafter amended, supplemented or replaced (so long as such amendment,
supplement or replacement agreement or arrangement is not materially disadvantageous (as
determined in good faith by GFL or any direct or indirect parent of GFL) to the holders of the
Notes when taken as a whole as compared to the original agreement or arrangement as in effect
on the Issue Date) or any transaction or payments contemplated thereby;


-----

(8) transactions with customers, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services that are
Affiliates of GFL, in each case in the ordinary course of business and which, in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of GFL are on terms at least as favorable to GFL as
would reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) transactions between GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person that is an
Affiliate solely because one or more of its directors or officers is also a director or officer of
GFL; provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of GFL on any such
transaction involving such other Person;

(10) any transaction with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in or
otherwise controls such Person; provided that no Affiliate of GFL or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall have a beneficial interest or otherwise participate
in such Person;

(11) a repurchase of Notes held by an Affiliate of GFL if repurchased on the same terms as have
been offered to all Holders that are not Affiliates of GFL;

(12) payments by GFL and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries made for any transaction or financial
advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking
activities (including in connection with financings, acquisitions or divestitures), which payments
are approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors (or
comparable governing body or managers) of GFL in good faith (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, may include payments to Affiliates of a Permitted Holder);

(13) investments by Affiliates in Indebtedness or preferred Equity Interests of GFL or any of its
Subsidiaries, so long as non-Affiliates were also offered the opportunity to invest in such
Indebtedness or preferred Equity Interests, and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity
as holders of Indebtedness or preferred Equity Interests of GFL or any of its Subsidiaries, so
long as such transaction is with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders)
and such Affiliates are treated no more favorably than all other holders of such class generally;

(14) intercompany transactions undertaken in good faith for the purpose of improving the consolidated
tax efficiency of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing
any covenant set forth in the Indenture; and

(15) the entering into of any tax sharing agreement or arrangement that complies with clause (16)(viii)
of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments” and the
performance under any such agreement or arrangement.

_Issuance of Note Guarantees_

After the Issue Date, GFL will cause each Material Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and
that guarantees the obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to become a Guarantor, execute
and deliver a Note Guarantee, and deliver an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Trustee, in each case
within 90 days of the date on which such Material Restricted Subsidiary was acquired, created, qualified,
designated or guaranteed the obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as applicable. Thereafter,
such Restricted Subsidiary will be a Guarantor for all purposes of the Indenture, subject to the provisions
described above under the caption “—Note Guarantees.”

_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_

The Board of Directors of GFL may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary; provided that:

(1) immediately after and giving effect to such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;


-----

(2) at the time of the designation, GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries could make a Restricted
Payment in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Subsidiary so designated in
compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) at the time of such designation, to the extent that any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary so
designated is not Non-Recourse Debt, any guarantee or other credit support thereof by GFL or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries could be incurred at such time in compliance with the
covenants set forth under the captions “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock” and “—Restricted Payments”;_

(4) such Subsidiary is not party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding with
GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary unless any such agreement, contract, arrangement or
understanding would, immediately after giving effect to such designation, be permitted by the
covenant set forth under the caption “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and

(5) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither GFL nor any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect obligation (a) to subscribe for additional Equity Interests
or (b) to maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or to cause such Person to
achieve any specified levels of operating results unless such obligation could be performed by
GFL in compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “—Restricted Payments” (and
the maximum amount of such obligation shall be deemed to be an Investment by the Issuer for
purposes of such covenant).

Any designation of a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to
the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of the resolutions of the Board of Directors of GFL
giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with
the preceding conditions. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding
requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for
purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date
under the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock,” GFL will be in default of such covenant._

The Board of Directors of GFL may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that:_

(1) immediately after and giving effect to such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(2) such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary
of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will
only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the
caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”;

(3) the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Unrestricted
Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the
designation and any such designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted
at that time in compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “—Restricted Payments”;

(4) all Liens upon property and assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary existing at the time of such
designation would be permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Liens”; and

(5) such Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant described under
the caption “—Issuance of Note Guarantees.”

_Reports_

The Issuer will provide to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall deliver to the Holders, the following:

(1) within 60 days after the end of each quarterly fiscal period in each fiscal year of GFL, other
than the last quarterly fiscal period of each such fiscal year, copies of:


-----

(a) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of GFL as at the end of such quarterly fiscal
period and unaudited consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in
shareholders’ equity of GFL for such quarterly fiscal period and, in the case of the second
and third quarters, for the portion of the fiscal year ending with such quarter; and

(b) an associated “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” prepared on a basis substantially
consistent with the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” included in the Offering
Memorandum; and

(2) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of GFL, copies of:

(a) an audited consolidated balance sheet of GFL as at the end of such year and audited
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity of GFL
for such fiscal year, together with a report of GFL’s auditors thereon; and

(b) an associated “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” prepared on a basis substantially
consistent with the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” included in the Offering
Memorandum; and

(3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported (and
in any event within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations), current reports
that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K Items 1.03, 2.01, 4.01, 5.01, 5.02(b)
(with respect to GFL’s chief executive officer or chief financial officer only) and 5.02(c) (with
respect to GFL’s chief executive officer or chief financial officer only) if GFL were required to
file such reports; provided that (a) no such current report will be required to be provided if GFL
determines in its good faith judgment that such event is not material to the business, assets,
operations or prospects of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or if GFL
determines in its good faith judgment that such disclosure would otherwise cause competitive
harm to the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of GFL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (in which event such nondisclosure shall be limited only to specific
provisions that would cause material harm and not the occurrence of the event itself) and
(b) in no event will any financial statements of an acquired business be required to be included
in any such current report,

in the case of each of the foregoing subclauses (1)(a) and (2)(a) prepared in accordance with GAAP. The
reports referred to in the foregoing subclauses (1) and (2) are collectively referred to as the “Financial Reports.”

GFL will, within 15 Business Days after providing to the Trustee any Financial Report, hold a
conference call to discuss such Financial Report and the results of operations for the applicable reporting
period. If GFL does not file reports with the SEC, then GFL will also maintain a website to which Holders,
prospective investors and securities analysts are given access, on which not later than the date by which the
Financial Reports are required to be provided to the Trustee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph,
GFL (i) makes available such Financial Reports and (ii) provides details about how to access on a toll-free
basis the quarterly conference calls described above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, (1) all Financial Reports will be deemed to have been
provided to the Trustee and to the Holders to the extent filed (a) on the System for Electronic Document
Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR+”) or any successor system thereto or (b) with the SEC via the Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) filing system or any successor system thereto, (2) the
requirements of this covenant will be deemed satisfied by the posting of reports that would be required to be
provided to the Holders on GFL’s website (or that of any of GFL’s parent companies), and (3) if GFL
holds a quarterly conference call for its equity holders within 15 Business Days of filing a Financial Report
on SEDAR+ or any successor system thereto, GFL will no longer be required to hold a separate conference
call in respect of such Financial Report for the Holders as provided above.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring compliance with filings on SEDAR+ or EDGAR.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding during any period when GFL is not subject to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act, or otherwise permitted to furnish the SEC with certain information


-----

pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the 1934 Act, GFL will furnish to Holders of Notes and to prospective
investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under
the 1933 Act.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Issuer nor GFL will be deemed to have
failed to comply with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default
_and Remedies” until 120 days after the date any report hereunder is due._

_Events of Default and Remedies_

Each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes;

(2) default in the payment when due (at Stated Maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with any of the other obligations, covenants or
agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) in the Indenture for
60 days after written notice has been given to the Issuer by the Trustee or to the Issuer and the
Trustee by the Holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes;

(4) default under any other mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness by GFL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by GFL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee existed on the Issue Date, or is created
after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the
applicable grace or cure period after final maturity provided in such Indebtedness (a
“Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default, which
remains outstanding or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates an amount
greater than $100.0 million; provided that if any such Payment Default is cured or waived or any
such acceleration is rescinded, as the case may be, such Event of Default under the Indenture
and any consequential acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded, so long as such
rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree;

(5) failure by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in excess
of an amount greater than $100.0 million in cash rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary by a court of competent jurisdiction, which judgments are not paid, discharged or
stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgments becomes final and non-appealable;

(6) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee of GFL or a Significant Subsidiary
shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason
to be in full force and effect, or GFL or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under its
Note Guarantee;

(7) GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to or within the meaning of any bankruptcy
law:

(a) commences a voluntary case or proceeding;

(b) applies for or consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case
or proceeding;


-----

(c) applies for or consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially
all of its assets; or

(d) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or

(8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any bankruptcy law that:

(a) is for relief against GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries as debtor in an involuntary
case or proceeding;

(b) appoints a Custodian of GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or a Custodian for all
or substantially all of the assets of GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or

(c) orders the liquidation of GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries;

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days and, in the case
of the insolvency of a Significant Subsidiary, such Significant Subsidiary remains a Significant
Subsidiary on such 60th day.

In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (7) or (8) above, all outstanding Notes will become
due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may
declare to be immediately due and payable, by notice in writing to the Issuer and (if given by the Holders)
to the Trustee, the principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest to the
date of acceleration; provided, however, that after any such declaration of acceleration, the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may rescind and annul such declaration
if: (a) all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of, interest and premium
(if any) on the Notes that have become due solely by the declaration of acceleration, have been cured or
waived; and (b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the
payment of principal or interest.

Except to enforce payment of the principal of, and premium (if any) or interest on any Note on or
after the Stated Maturity of such Note (after giving effect to the grace periods specified in clauses (1) and
(2) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default and Remedies”), a Holder will not have any right to
institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for
any remedy thereunder, unless the Trustee:

(1) shall have failed to act for a period of 60 days after receiving written notice of a continuing
Event of Default from such Holder and a request to act from Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding;

(2) has been offered indemnity and funding thereof, if requested, satisfactory to the Trustee in its
reasonable judgment; and

(3) during such 60 day period, has not received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to
the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default
and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment
of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver
promptly to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuer
is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.


-----

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, any
Guarantor or any of their Affiliates, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Notes, the Indenture, or the Note Guarantees, or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases
all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all of its obligations and the obligations of the Guarantors under
the Notes, the Indenture and the Note Guarantees (“legal defeasance”), except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created
pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost, or stolen
Notes and the maintenance of a register in respect of the Notes;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the legal defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, terminate its obligations and those of each
Guarantor under most of the covenants in the Indenture, except as otherwise described in the Indenture
(“covenant defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a
Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If covenant defeasance occurs, certain Events of Default
(not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation, and insolvency events) will no longer
constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant
defeasance option.

In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds or property in
trust for the purpose of making payment on such Notes an amount of cash or Government
Securities as will, together with the income to accrue thereon and reinvestment thereof, be
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm, or firm of
independent public accountants, to pay, satisfy and discharge the entire principal, interest, if any,
premium, if any and any other sums due to the Stated Maturity or an optional redemption
date of the Notes;

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied
to such deposit and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowing);

(3) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders over its other creditors or with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, or defrauding any of its other creditors or others;

(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee, (a) an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Trustee in its
reasonable judgment or an advance tax ruling from the Canada Revenue Agency (or successor
agency) to the effect that the Holders of outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or
loss for Canadian income tax purposes as a result of such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance,
as the case may be, and will be subject to Canadian federal income tax on the same amounts, in
the same manner, and at the same times as would have been the case if such legal defeasance or
covenant defeasance, as the case may be, had not occurred; (b) in the case of legal defeasance,


-----

an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Trustee in its reasonable judgment to the effect that
(i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a
ruling, or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income
tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm
that, the Holders of outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such legal defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such legal defeasance had not occurred; and (c) in the case of covenant defeasance,
an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Trustee in its reasonable judgment to the effect that the
Holders of outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been in the case if
such covenant defeasance had not occurred;

(5) the Issuer must satisfy the Trustee that it has paid, caused to be paid or made provisions for the
payment of all applicable expenses of the Trustee;

(6) the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a Default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which GFL or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which GFL or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound; and

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent
herein provided relating to the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be,
have been complied with.

Any funds or obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the above provisions shall be
(a) denominated in the currency or denomination of the Notes in respect of which such deposit is made,
(b) irrevocable, subject to certain exceptions, and (c) made under the terms of an escrow and/or trust agreement
in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and which provides for the due and punctual payment of
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes being satisfied.

If the Trustee is unable to apply any money in accordance with the above provisions by reason of any
legal proceeding or any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting such application, the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Indenture
and the affected Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no money had been deposited pursuant to
the above provisions until such time as the Trustee is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with the
above provisions; provided that if the Issuer has made any payment in respect of principal of, premium, if
any, or interest on Notes or, as applicable, other amounts because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the
Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the
money held by the Trustee.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided herein, with the affirmative votes of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes represented and voting at a meeting of Holders, or by a resolution in writing of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or offer to purchase, or exchange offer for,
Notes):

(1) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees may each be amended or supplemented, and

(2) any existing Default or Event of Default or lack of compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees may be waived.

Without the consent of, or a resolution passed by the affirmative votes of or signed by, each Holder
affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a nonconsenting
Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement
or waiver;


-----

(2) reduce the principal of any Note or change the time for payment thereof;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) make any Note payable in a currency other than that stated in the Notes;

(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if
any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration);

(6) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture and the Notes of any Holder to
institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest
on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(7) modify or change any provision of the Indenture or the related definitions affecting the ranking
of the Notes or any Note Guarantee in any manner adverse to the Holders;

(8) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture
otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(9) modify these amending provisions.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any Holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors
and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, that
the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the
Code);

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to Holders of Notes
in the case of an amalgamation, merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s assets or otherwise to comply with the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Amalgamation, Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(4) to add a co-issuer of the Notes, to add any additional Guarantors or to evidence the release of
any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee to the extent that such release is
permitted by the Indenture, or to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees or add collateral
with respect to the Notes;

(5) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees to any provision of this

(6) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in
the Indenture;

adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder; or

(8) to evidence or provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee.

For greater certainty, any item of business referred to in the Indenture requiring the written approval
or consent of the Holders may be obtained by means of the affirmative vote of the requisite Holders of
Notes represented at a duly constituted meeting of Holders or a resolution in writing of the requisite Holders
of Notes then outstanding. The consent of Holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve


-----

the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders of the Notes to receive
payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder (except as to any
surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Notes expressly provided for in the Indenture)
when

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have
been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and
thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due
and payable by reason of the sending of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become
due and payable within one year and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to
be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders,
cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and
Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient to pay and discharge the principal,
premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of final maturity or redemption; provided
that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an
amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium, calculated as of the
date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium deficit as of the date of
redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be
deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption; provided, further, that
any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms
that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit or will
occur as a result of the deposit other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the
borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and the deposit will not result in a breach or
violation of, or constitute a default under, any other material instrument to which GFL or any
Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by which GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound;

(3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture; and

(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at final maturity or the redemption date, as the
case may be.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee may, in its personal or other capacity, buy, sell, lend upon and deal in Notes and generally
contract and enter into financial transactions with the Issuer or otherwise; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to a court having appropriate
jurisdiction for permission to continue or resign.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that the Trustee, after the occurrence of an
Event of Default, is required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a reasonably prudent


-----

man in comparable circumstances. The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee security
and indemnity (and funding thereof, if requested) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability
or expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

**Calculations**

The Issuer will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the Indenture or the Notes.
The Issuer will make all such calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, its calculations will be
final and binding on Holders. The Issuer will provide a schedule of its calculations to the Trustee when

calculations without independent verification. The Trustee will deliver a copy of any such schedule to any
Holder upon the written request of such Holder.

or assets of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries other than such property or assets securing
the Indebtedness being extended, refinanced, renewed, replaced, defeased, discharged or
refunded (including any after-acquired property to the extent it would have been subject to the
original Lien, plus improvements and accessions to, such property or proceeds or distributions

or covenant or calculation hereunder, including the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Secured Net Leverage
Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, or the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets
hereunder, the determination of such test, covenant, ratio, or Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (including
in connection with Specified Transactions or entry into Municipal Waste Contracts or Put-or-Pay
Agreements) in accordance with below:

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets and
any financial ratios or tests, including the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Secured Net Leverage
Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, shall be calculated in the manner prescribed under this
definition.

(b) For purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets and any financial ratios or
tests, including the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio and compliance with covenants determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or
Total Assets, Municipal Waste Contracts and Put-or-Pay Agreements that have been entered into,
Specified Transactions that have been made and Sustainability Projects (and the incurrence or repayment
of any Indebtedness in connection therewith, subject to clause (d) of this definition, in each case,
(i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously
with the event for which the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets or any such ratio is
made shall be calculated on a pro forma basis (x) assuming that all such Municipal Waste Contracts and
Put-or-Pay Agreements shall have been entered into and all such Specified Transactions had occurred
or Sustainability Projects were in existence (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated EBITDA and
Total Assets and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified
Transaction or Sustainability Project) on the first day of the applicable Test Period and (y) including
projected and not yet realized revenue and projected and not yet accrued costs, expenses and other
charges or liabilities pursuant to any such Municipal Waste Contracts, Put-or-Pay Agreements or
Sustainability Projects. If since the beginning of any (i) applicable Test Period any Person that
subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or
into GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have entered
into any Municipal Waste Contract or Put-or-Pay Agreements, made any Specified Transaction or
have a Sustainability Project that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition or (ii) any
Sustainability Entity since the beginning of such period shall have a Sustainability Project, then the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Secured Net Leverage Ratio, and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated EBITDA and Total Assets shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in
accordance with this definition. For greater certainty, with respect to adjustments to Consolidated
EBITDA with respect to any Municipal Waste Contract or Put-or-Pay Agreement, (a) Projected Run
Rate EBITDA shall be used for each 12-month period commencing on the later of (1) the date of
execution of the contract and (2) nine months and one day prior to the Service Commencement Date
and ending on that date which is three months after the Service Commencement Date, (b) for any 12month period ending more than three months after the Service Commencement Date but not more
than 15 months after the Service Commencement Date, actual Consolidated EBITDA generated by and
attributable to the relevant contract shall be included for each month which is more than three months
after the Service Commencement Date and Projected Run Rate EBITDA, pro-rated for the balance
of the relevant 12-month period, shall be used for each month in such period ended on the last day of
the third month after the Service Commencement Date (such that Consolidated EBITDA determined at
the end of the fourth month following the Service Commencement Date shall be the sum of actual
Consolidated EBITDA for such fourth month plus 11/12 of the 12-month Projected Run Rate EBITDA),
and (c) for any 12-month period ending more than 15 months after the Service Commencement Date,
only actual Consolidated EBITDA shall be used and there shall be no adjustment with respect to the
relevant contract. To avoid duplication, the actual Consolidated EBITDA generated during the 12month period ending three months after the Service Commencement Date shall be deducted from the
calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for the relevant contract. For greater certainty, with respect to


-----

adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA with respect to any Sustainability Project, (a) Projected Run
Rate EBITDA shall be used for the four fiscal quarter period commencing on the first day of the fiscal
quarter in which the applicable Commercial Operations Date occurs provided that actual Consolidated
EBITDA generated by and attributable to the relevant Sustainability Project shall be included for each
month for which commercial operations are conducted commencing with the first month in the first
full fiscal quarter following the Commercial Operations Date and Projected Run Rate EBITDA, adjusted
for the balance of the relevant four fiscal quarter period, shall be used for each other month in such
period (such that if the Commercial Operations Date occurs on the last day of the first month of a fiscal
quarter, then (i) Consolidated EBITDA determined at the end of such fiscal quarter shall be the 12month Projected Run Rate EBITDA, (ii) Consolidated EBITDA determined at the end of the next
following fiscal quarter (being the first full fiscal quarter following the Commercial Operations Date)
shall be the sum of actual EBITDA for such fiscal quarter plus the last nine months of the 12-month
Projected Run Rate EBITDA, (iii) Consolidated EBITDA determined at the end of the next following
fiscal quarter shall be the sum of actual EBITDA for the two fiscal quarters then ended plus the last
six months of the 12-month Projected Run Rate EBITDA, and (iv) Consolidated EBITDA determined
at the end of the next following fiscal quarter shall be the sum of actual Consolidated EBITDA for the
three fiscal quarters then ended plus the last three months of the 12-month Projected Run Rate
EBITDA), and thereafter (b) only actual Consolidated EBITDA shall be used and there shall be no
adjustment with respect to the relevant Sustainability Project, provided that for each of paragraphs
(a) and (b) up to a maximum of 80% of the proportionate equity share of Projected Run Rate EBITDA
in respect of the applicable Sustainability Project may be included in Consolidated EBITDA for the
applicable period.

(c) Subject to the immediately following sentence with respect to Sustainability Projects,
whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an Municipal Waste Contract or Put-or-Pay Agreement, a
Specified Transaction or a Sustainability Project, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith
by GFL and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) projected and not yet realized revenue and
projected and not yet accrued costs, expenses and other charges or liabilities pursuant to any such
Municipal Waste Contracts, Put-or-Pay Agreements or Sustainability Projects and (y) the amount of
“run rate” cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges and expenses and cost
synergies projected by GFL in good faith to be realized as a result of specified actions taken, committed
to be taken or expected to be taken (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings,
operating expense reductions, restructuring charges and expenses and cost synergies had been realized
on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring
charges and expenses and cost synergies were realized during the entirety of such period) relating to
such Municipal Waste Contract, Put-or-Pay Agreement, Sustainability Projects or Specified Transaction,
and “run rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken,
committed to be taken or expected to be taken (including any savings expected to result from the
elimination of a public target’s compliance costs with public company requirements), net of the amount
of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions; provided that (A) with respect to
clause (y) above, such amounts are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable (in the good faith
determination of GFL), (B) with respect to clause (y) above, such actions are taken, committed to be
taken or expected to be taken no later than eighteen (18) months after the date of such Specified
Transaction or entry into such Municipal Waste Contract, (C) no amounts shall be added pursuant to
this clause (c) to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing
Consolidated EBITDA, whether through a pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such
period and (D) it is understood and agreed that, subject to compliance with the other provisions of this
clause (c), amounts to be included in pro forma calculations pursuant to this clause (c) may be included
in Test Periods in which the Municipal Waste Contract or Put-or-Pay Agreement, Specified Transaction
or Sustainability Project to which such amounts relate to is no longer being given pro forma effect
pursuant to clause (b) above. In addition, for pro forma calculations with respect to any Sustainability
Project, the following shall apply: (x) the pro forma adjustments referred to in immediately preceding
sentence may be made commencing on the Commercial Operations Date for such Sustainability
Project, (y) a commodity price index (determined in the good faith determination of GFL), acting
reasonably, shall be used for the applicable commodity to which such Sustainability Project relates, it
being agreed that for renewable natural gas the following are acceptable indices: “RIN” from the “Oil


-----

Price Information Service” or “Brown Gas” from “Bloomberg”, and (z) the aggregate amount of
Consolidated EBITDA for all Sustainability Entities referred to in subsection (ii) of such definition
included in any period pursuant to the Indenture shall not exceed an amount equal to 5.0% of the
Consolidated EBITDA of GFL for the same period.

(d) In the event that GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or
guaranteeing) or repays (including by repurchase, redemption, retirement, extinguishment, defeasance,
discharge, escrow or similar arrangements) any Indebtedness or issues, repurchases or redeems
Disqualified Stock or preferred Stock which is included in the calculations of the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as the case may be
(in each case, other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility in the ordinary
course of business for working capital purposes), (i) during the applicable Test Period, (ii) subsequent
to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the
calculation of any such ratio is made, or (iii) in the case of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, on or
prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is
made (the “Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Secured Net Leverage Ratio
and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to
such incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on
the last day of the applicable Test Period; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of Secured
Indebtedness shall not give effect to (1) any Secured Indebtedness incurred on the Calculation Date
(other than Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1)(i)(y) of the definition of Permitted
Debt or clause (1)(ii) of the definition of Permitted Liens) or (2) any repayment, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness to the extent such repayment, retirement, extinguishment,
defeasance or other discharge results from the proceeds of such Secured Indebtedness referred to in
clause (1) and provided, further, that the pro forma calculation of Fixed Charges shall not give effect to
(x) any Permitted Debt incurred on the Calculation Date (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant
to clause (13) of the definition of Permitted Debt) or (y) any repayment, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness to the extent such repayment, retirement, extinguishment,
defeasance or other discharge results from the proceeds of such Permitted Debt referred to in clause (x).
If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest
on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date such calculation is being made
had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation
applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Financing Lease shall be deemed to accrue at an interest
rate reasonably determined by GFL to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease in
accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate
based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a term SOFR, or other rate, shall be deemed to have
been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as GFL
may designate.

(e) On and after the date pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition, Investment or customer
contract and on which GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary, which acquisition, Investment or customer
contract, including through mergers or consolidations, or any Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
acquired by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and related financing transactions and including
increases in ownership of Restricted Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or
subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, has yet to be consummated
but for which a definitive agreement governing such acquisition, Investment or customer contract has
been executed and remains in effect, such pro forma effect shall be deemed to continue at all times
thereafter, and such acquisition, Investment or customer contract shall be deemed to have been
consummated on the first day of the four-quarter reference period and any Indebtedness incurred or
deemed to be incurred in connection with such acquisition, Investment or customer contract shall be
deemed to be outstanding, for purposes of determining ratio-based conditions and baskets (including
baskets that are determined on the basis of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets) until such
acquisition, Investment or customer contract is consummated or such definitive agreement is terminated
(it being understood that any such Indebtedness that is actually incurred shall continue to be treated
as outstanding (until actually repaid) for such purposes notwithstanding the termination of such
agreement or consummation of such acquisition, Investment or customer contract); provided that
_pro forma effect shall also be given to Consolidated EBITDA in connection with any such acquisition,_


-----

Investment or customer contract as if such acquisition, Investment or customer contract had been
consummated on the first day of the applicable Test Period to the extent the applicable ratio being so
calculated would be greater than the calculation of such ratio without giving such pro forma effect to the
calculation of Consolidated EBITDA after giving effect to the preceding provisions of this clause (e),
but in no event shall such pro forma effect of the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA be given effect to
the extent it would result in the applicable ratio being less that the calculation of such ratio without
giving pro forma effect to such acquisition, Investment or customer contract; provided further that
Consolidated EBITDA for such Test Period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis giving effect to
(i) any expense and cost reductions and other synergies related to such acquisition, Investment or
customer contract and (ii) any other expense reductions and cost savings related to operational
efficiencies, strategic initiatives or purchasing improvements and other synergies (whether or not related
to such acquisition, Investment or customer contract), in each case that have occurred prior to the
Calculation Date or are reasonably expected to occur within 24 months of the Calculation Date, in the
reasonable judgment of the chief financial or accounting officer of GFL in good faith (regardless of
whether those cost savings or operating improvements could then be reflected in pro forma financial
statements in accordance with Regulation S-X); provided that such net cost savings, initiatives,
improvements and synergies are reasonably identifiable and quantifiable.

(f) It is expressly understood and agreed that pro forma adjustments and calculations need not be
prepared in compliance with Regulation S-X; provided that, to the extent any pro forma adjustments
pursuant to clause (c) above are not in compliance with Regulation S-X, the aggregate amount of such
add-backs to Consolidated EBITDA shall be subject to the limitation set forth in clause (11) of the
definition of Consolidated EBITDA.

“Projected Run Rate EBITDA” means, with respect to any Municipal Waste Contract, Put-or-Pay
Agreement or Sustainability Project for any 12-month period, the Consolidated EBITDA which GFL

of the occurrence of a Change of Control or (z) public notice of the intention of GFL to effect a Change
of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly
announced ratings review for possible downgrade by either of such two Rating Agencies, it being understood
that a change in ratings outlook shall not extend such 60-day period); provided, however, that a Rating
Decline otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred
in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a Rating Decline for purposes of
the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) unless each of such two Rating Agencies making


-----

the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply announces or publicly confirms or
informs the Trustee in writing at GFL’s request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any
event or circumstances comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of
Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Decline);

**BOOK ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**Book-Entry; Delivery and Form**

The Notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (the
“Rule 144A Notes”). The Notes also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered, global
form in minimum denominations of US$2,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof. Notes
will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one or more notes in registered, global form without
interest coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes initially will be represented
by one or more temporary notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, the
“Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”).

The Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited upon
issuance with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as custodian for The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”), in New York, New York, and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit
to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Through and including the
40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period
through and including such 40th day, the “Restricted Period”), beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes may be held only through the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream
Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes
delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below.
Within a reasonable time period after the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Regulation S Temporary
Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent notes in registered, global form without interest
coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Permanent Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes;”the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A
Global Notes collectively being the “Global Notes”) upon delivery to DTC of certification of compliance
with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes and pursuant to Regulation S as provided in the Indenture.
Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges
_between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes.”_

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to
another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes
may not be exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) except in the
limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.” Except in
the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be
entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form.

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to
certain restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”
Regulation S Notes will also bear the legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers
of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC
and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), which
may change from time to time.

**Depositary Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of
the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these
operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss
these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its
participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of


-----

transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of
its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers),
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s
system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through
or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the
“Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on
behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and
transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of
the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by
the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership
of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly
through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests
therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants.
Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants.
After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream.
Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositaries, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as
operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through
Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems.

The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities
that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will
be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf
of Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such
interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

**Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their**
**names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered**
**owners or “holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.**

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered
in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the
Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, GFL and the trustee will treat the Persons in whose names
the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the Notes for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither GFL, the Trustee nor any agent of GFL or the
Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect
Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or
Indirect Participants.


-----

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such
as the Notes (including principal and interest) is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the
payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such
payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership
of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by
the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing
instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect
Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or GFL. Neither GFL nor the Trustee
will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the
beneficial owners of the Notes, and GFL and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in
relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants
will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules
and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, crossmarket
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other
hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require
delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system
in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such
system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements,
deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by
delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in
accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants
and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or
Clearstream.

DTC has advised GFL that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at
the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global
Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such
Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under
the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form,
and to distribute such notes to its Participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants
in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform
such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. None of GFL, the Trustee or any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or
their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies GFL that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global
Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the 1934 Act and, in either case,
GFL fails to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days;

(2) GFL, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the
Certificated Notes and any Participant requests a Certificated Note; provided that in no event
shall the Regulation S Temporary Global Note be exchanged for Certificated Notes prior to
(a) the expiration of the Restricted Period and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under the
provisions of Regulation S; or


-----

(3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes
and DTC requests the issuance of certificated Notes in exchange for the Global Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the Indenture. In all cases,
Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be
registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the
depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend
referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See
_“Transfer Restrictions.”_

**Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note
may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred to a Person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and
other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in
the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the
Restricted Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided
in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of
Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the
Restricted Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or
Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the
Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC
participant through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any
such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global
Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a
Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be
an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such
other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide Euroclear
or Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the Indenture certifying that


-----

the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note is either a non-U.S. person
or a U.S. person that has purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration
requirements under the 1933 Act, and Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the
Trustee (or the paying agent if other than the Trustee) a certificate in the form required by the Indenture, prior
to any exchange of such beneficial interest for a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global
Notes.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

GFL through its paying agent will make payments in respect of the Notes represented by the Global
Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. GFL will make all payments of principal, interest, premium,
if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to
each such holder’s registered address. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible
to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading
activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. GFL
expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. DTC has advised GFL that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in
a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant in DTC will be
received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s
settlement date.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with Notes that are
held as capital assets by a non-U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquires the Notes pursuant to this offering
at their initial offering price.

A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is not, for United States federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

   - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

   - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or
more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has
a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a
United States person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be
changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different
from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income
taxes and does not address the effects of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or foreign,
state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular
circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income
tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal
income tax laws (including if you are a United States expatriate, “controlled foreign corporation,” “passive
foreign investment company” or a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income
tax purposes).

If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes)
holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding the Notes, you should consult
your tax advisors.

**If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the**
**particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of**
**the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax laws and the laws of**
**any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**United States Federal Withholding Tax**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, United States federal withholding
tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the Notes under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided that:

   - interest paid on the Notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States;

   - you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury
regulations;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is actually or constructively related to us through
stock ownership;


-----

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the Notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

   - either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
Form W-8, and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined
under the Code, or (b) you hold your Notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the
certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules
apply to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject
to a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a
properly executed:

  - IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

   - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the Notes is not subject
to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in
the United States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income Tax”). The 30% United
States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain that you
realize on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**United States Federal Income Tax**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the Notes is effectively
connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base), then you generally will be subject
to United States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if you were
a United States person as defined under the Code (although you will be exempt from the 30% United
States federal withholding tax described above, provided the certification requirements discussed above in
“—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied). In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you
may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your
effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, any gain realized on the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will not be subject to United States federal
income tax unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment or fixed base), in which case such gain generally will be subject to United States
federal income tax (and possibly branch profits tax) in the same manner as effectively connected
interest as described above; or

   - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
that disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless an applicable income tax
treaty provides otherwise, you generally will be subject to a 30% United States federal income tax
on any gain recognized, which may be offset by certain United States source losses.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments generally
will be reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any
withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the
provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments on the Notes that
we make to you, provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason
to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has
received from you the statement described above in the fifth bullet point under “—United States Federal
Withholding Tax.”


-----

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the
proceeds of a sale or other disposition of Notes within the United States or conducted through certain
United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify under penalties of perjury that you are a
non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United
States person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a
30% United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest paid on the Notes to (i) a “foreign
financial institution” (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide sufficient documentation,
typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or
deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance with an
intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids withholding, or (ii) a
“non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the Code and whether such non-financial foreign
entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary) which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically
on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information
regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If an interest payment
is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under
“—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” an applicable withholding agent may credit the withholding
under FATCA against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. While withholding under FATCA
would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of the
Notes, proposed United States Treasury regulations (upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations
are issued) eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. You should consult your
own tax advisors regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to your ownership and disposition
of the Notes.

**CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

In the opinion of Stikeman Elliott LLP, counsel to GFL US, and Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg
LLP, counsel to the initial purchasers, the following is a summary of the principal Canadian federal income
tax considerations generally applicable to a purchaser who acquires Notes as a beneficial owner pursuant
to this offering and who, at all relevant times for purposes of the Tax Act: (i) is (or is deemed to be) resident
in Canada, (ii) is entitled to all payments under the Notes, (iii) deals at arm’s length with GFL US, all
Guarantors and all initial purchasers, and is not affiliated with GFL US, any Guarantor or any initial
purchaser; and (iv) holds the Notes as capital property (a “Noteholder”). Generally, the Notes will be
considered to be capital property to a Noteholder provided that the Noteholder does not hold the Notes in
the course of carrying on a business or as part of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.

This summary does not apply to a holder of a Note: (i) that is a “financial institution”within the meaning
of section 142.2 of the Tax Act; (ii) that reports its “Canadian tax results” within the meaning of the Tax
Act in a currency other than Canadian currency; (iii) an interest in which is a “tax shelter investment” for the
purposes of the Tax Act; or (iv) that has entered into, or will enter into, a “derivative forward agreement”
within the meaning of the Tax Act with respect to a Note. Such holders should consult their own tax advisors.

This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Tax Act and counsel’s understanding of the
current administrative policies and practices of the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”) made publicly
available in writing prior to the date hereof. This summary also takes into account all specific proposals to
amend the Tax Act that have been publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada)
prior to the date hereof (the “Tax Proposals”), and assumes that all such Tax Proposals will be enacted in
the form proposed. No assurance can be given that the Tax Proposals will be enacted as proposed or at all.
This summary does not otherwise take into account or anticipate any changes in law or in the administrative
policies or assessing practices of the CRA, whether by legislative, governmental or judicial action, nor does
it take into account any other federal or any provincial, territorial or foreign tax considerations.

**This summary is of a general nature only, is not exhaustive of all Canadian federal income tax consequences**
**and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed as, legal or tax advice to any particular holder of Notes.**
**Holders of Notes are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences to them of an**
**investment in the Notes having regard to their own particular circumstances.**

**Foreign Currency**

Generally, for purposes of the Tax Act, all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition
of a Note must be converted into Canadian dollars using the rate of exchange quoted by the Bank of Canada
on the date such amounts arose, or such other rate of exchange as is acceptable to the CRA. As a result, a
Noteholder may realize a capital gain or a capital loss on the disposition of a Note by virtue of fluctuations
in the Canadian dollar/United States dollar exchange rate.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

A Noteholder that is a corporation, partnership, unit trust or trust of which a corporation or a
partnership is a beneficiary will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year any
interest on a Note that accrued or is deemed to accrue to it to the end of the taxation year or that became
receivable or was received by it before the end of the taxation year, except to the extent that such interest was
otherwise included in computing its income for a preceding taxation year.

Any other Noteholder, including any individual, will be required to include in computing the
Noteholder’s income for a taxation year any amount that was received or became receivable by such
Noteholder in the taxation year as interest on the Notes, depending upon the method regularly followed by
the Noteholder in computing income, to the extent that such amount was not included in computing the
Noteholder’s income for a preceding taxation year.

Any premium paid by GFL US to a Noteholder because of the redemption or repurchase of a Note
before its maturity will generally be deemed to be interest received by the Noteholder at the time of the
payment to the extent that it can reasonably be considered to relate to, and does not exceed the value at that
time of, the interest that would have been paid or payable by GFL US on the Note for a taxation year of


-----

GFL US ending after that time. Such interest will be required to be included in computing the Noteholder’s
income in the manner described above.

**_Disposition of the Notes_**

On a disposition or deemed disposition of a Note by a Noteholder, including a payment on maturity
or a redemption or repurchase by GFL US, the Noteholder will generally be required to include in computing
its income for the taxation year in which the disposition occurs an amount equal to the interest that has
accrued on the Note to the date of the disposition to the extent that such amount was not otherwise included
in computing the Noteholder’s income for that taxation year or a preceding taxation year.

In addition, on a disposition or deemed disposition of a Note, a Noteholder will realize a capital gain
(or a capital loss) to the extent that the proceeds of disposition of the Note, net of any amount included in
the Noteholder’s income as interest as well as any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the
adjusted cost base of the Note to the Noteholder immediately before the disposition or deemed disposition.
Generally, a Noteholder’s adjusted cost base of a Note will include any amount paid to acquire the Note,
as adjusted in accordance with the Tax Act.

Subject to Tax Proposals released as part of the 2024 Federal Budget (the “2024 Federal Budget
**Proposals”), a Noteholder will generally be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year**
one-half of the amount of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by the Noteholder in that
taxation year. Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Act, a Noteholder will generally
be required to deduct one-half of the amount of any capital loss (an “allowable capital loss”) realized by the
Noteholder in a taxation year from taxable capital gains realized by the Noteholder in that taxation year.
Allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains realized by a Noteholder in a particular taxation year
may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and
deducted in any subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized by the Noteholder in any
such taxation year, subject to and in accordance with the detailed rules contained in the Tax Act. Pursuant
to the 2024 Federal Budget Proposals, the capital gains inclusion rate for a Noteholder in a particular taxation
year is proposed to increase from one-half to two-thirds, but where the Noteholder is an individual
(excluding a trust), only to the extent that, generally, the aggregate amount of capital gains realized by the
Noteholder in such year, net of capital losses realized in such year and capital losses carried forward or back
to such year, exceeds $250,000. The 2024 Federal Budget Proposals are generally proposed to apply to
capital gains realized on or after June 25, 2024. The 2024 Federal Budget Proposals also provide for
adjustments of carried forward or carried back allowable capital losses to account for changes in the relevant
inclusion rates. However, no draft legislation to implement the 2024 Federal Budget Proposals has been
released by the Minister of Finance (Canada). Consequently, many aspects of how the Tax Act will be
amended in connection with the 2024 Federal Budget Proposals remain unclear. Noteholders who may be
subject to the 2024 Federal Budget Proposals should consult their own tax advisors with respect to their
particular circumstances.

Capital gains realized by a Noteholder that is an individual (other than certain trusts) may increase the
Noteholder’s liability for alternative minimum tax.

**_Additional Refundable Tax_**

A Noteholder that is a Canadian-controlled private corporation throughout a taxation year or that is a
“substantive CCPC” (as defined in certain Tax Proposals) at any time in the year may be liable to pay an
additional refundable tax on its “aggregate investment income” (as defined in the Tax Act) for the taxation
year, including interest income and taxable capital gains.

**_Foreign Property Information Reporting_**

A Noteholder that is a “specified Canadian entity” (as defined in the Tax Act) for a taxation year or
fiscal period is required under the Tax Act to file an information return for the taxation year or fiscal period
disclosing certain prescribed information regarding its holdings of “specified foreign property” (as defined
in the Tax Act) if the aggregate cost amount of such holdings at any time in the year or period exceeds
$100,000. The Notes will constitute specified foreign property for these purposes and their cost amount


-----

will count towards the calculation of the $100,000 threshold. Subject to certain exceptions, a taxpayer
resident in Canada, other than a corporation or trust exempt from tax under Part I of the Tax Act, will be a
specified Canadian entity, as will certain partnerships. Penalties will apply where a Noteholder fails to file
the required information return in respect of such Noteholder’s “specified foreign property” on a timely basis
in accordance with the Tax Act. The reporting rules in the Tax Act are complex and this summary does
not purport to explain all circumstances in which reporting may be required. Noteholders should consult
their own tax advisors regarding compliance with these reporting requirements.

**_Eligibility for Investment_**

Based on the current provisions of the Tax Act in force as of the date hereof, the Notes are not
expected to be qualified investments for trusts governed by registered retirement savings plans, registered
retirement income funds, deferred profit sharing plans, registered education savings plans, registered disability
savings plans, tax-free savings accounts or first home savings accounts (collectively, “Registered Plans”).
The Tax Act imposes penalties for the acquisition and holding of non-qualified investments by Registered
Plans. Any person contemplating an acquisition of a Note by a Registered Plan is urged to consult their own
tax advisor.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of
Notes by (i) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning Section 3(3)of the U.S. Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) plans,
individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code
or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to the
fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(collectively, “Similar Laws”), and (iii) entities whose underlying assets are considered to include the assets
of any of the foregoing described in clauses (i) and (ii) (each of the foregoing described in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) referred to herein as a “Plan”).

**_General Fiduciary Matters_**

Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of
a Plan that is a Benefit Plan Investor (as defined below) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets
of a Benefit Plan Investor and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Benefit Plan Investor
or the management or disposition of the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation to a Benefit Plan Investor, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of
the Benefit Plan Investor. The term “benefit plan investor” (“Benefit Plan Investor”) is generally defined to
include (a) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that are subject to Title I
of ERISA, (b) “plans” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code to which Section 4975 of the Code
applies (including, without limitation, “Keogh” plans and IRAs), and (c) entities whose underlying assets
include plan assets by reason of such an employee benefit plan or plan’s investment in such entity (e.g., an
entity of which 25% or more of the total value of any class of equity interests is held by Benefit Plan Investors
and which does not satisfy another exception under ERISA). In considering an investment in the Notes of
a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with
the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or
any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any
other applicable Similar Laws.

**_Prohibited Transaction Issues_**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Benefit Plan Investors from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the
meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. Such transactions are referred to as “prohibited transactions” and include, without
limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the
sale or exchange of any property between a Benefit Plan Investor and a party in interest or a disqualified
person, and (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of
any plan assets of a Benefit Plan Investor. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under Title I
of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Benefit Plan Investor that
engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under Title I
of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor with respect to which the
Issuer, the Guarantors, the initial purchasers or any of our or their respective affiliates is considered a party
in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held
in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that
may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition
or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting


-----

insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds,
PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions
determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20)
of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly
or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with
respect to the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor involved in the transaction and, provided, further, that the
Benefit Plan Investor receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration in connection with
the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application.
Fiduciaries of Benefit Plan Investors relying on these or any other exemption with respect to an investment
in the Notes should carefully review the exemption in consultation with their own legal advisors to assure it is
applicable. There can be no assurance that any such exemptions will be available, or that all of the conditions
of any such exemptions will be satisfied, with respect to transactions involving the Notes.

Plans such as governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as
defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), are
generally not subject to the fiduciary or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code but may be subject to Similar Laws. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation
with their legal advisors, should consider the impact of any applicable Similar Laws on investments in the
Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets
of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
ERISA and the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**_Representation_**

Accordingly, by acquisition and holding of a Note or any interest in a Note, each person who authorizes
such acquisition and holding and each subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to have represented
and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold
the Note or any interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the
Notes or any interest therein by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under
any applicable Similar Laws.

THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NECESSARILY GENERAL IN NATURE AND DOES
NOT ADDRESS ALL ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE UNDER ERISA, THE CODE OR OTHER
APPLICABLE SIMILAR LAWS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS LEGAL ADVICE OR A
LEGAL OPINION. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE RULES AND THE PENALTIES
THAT MAY BE IMPOSED UPON PERSONS INVOLVED IN NONEXEMPT PROHIBITED
TRANSACTIONS, IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT FIDUCIARIES, OR OTHER
PERSONS CONSIDERING PURCHASING THE NOTES (OR HOLDING THE NOTES) ON BEHALF
OF, OR WITH THE ASSETS OF, ANY PLAN, CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN LEGAL ADVISORS
REGARDING THE POTENTIAL APPLICABILITY OF ERISA, SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE AND
ANY SIMILAR LAWS TO SUCH INVESTMENT AND WHETHER AN EXEMPTION WOULD BE
APPLICABLE TO THE PURCHASE AND HOLDING OF THE NOTES. PURCHASERS OF THE
NOTES HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT THEIR PURCHASE
AND HOLDING OF THE NOTES COMPLIES WITH THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY RULES
OF ERISA AND DOES NOT VIOLATE THE PROHIBITED TRANSACTION RULES OF ERISA,
THE CODE OR APPLICABLE SIMILAR LAWS. THE SALE OF THE NOTES TO A PLAN IS IN NO
RESPECT A REPRESENTATION BY US OR THE INITIAL PURCHASERS THAT AN INVESTMENT
IN THE NOTES IS APPROPRIATE FOR PLANS GENERALLY OR WHETHER SUCH
INVESTMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement between the Issuer and the
initial purchasers, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed
to purchase from the Issuer, the entire aggregate principal amount of the Notes.

The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to
purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the initial
purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the purchase agreement if any of them are
purchased.

The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change
the offering price and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain
of their affiliates. The offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance
and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.

In the purchase agreement, the Issuer has agreed that it will indemnify the initial purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers
may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The Notes have not been registered under the 1933 Act or the securities laws of any other place. In the
purchase agreement, each initial purchaser has agreed that:

   - The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to
an exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act or in transactions not subject to
those registration requirements.

   - During the initial distribution of the Notes, it will offer or sell the Notes only to persons reasonably
believed to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and outside the United
States in compliance with Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within
the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the 1933 Act.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”). Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the**
EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to
an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2
of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it


-----

forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the UK
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
UK Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes may not be offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document other than (i) in
circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies (Winding
Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (“Companies (Winding
Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance”) or which do not constitute an invitation to the public
within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong)
(“Securities and Futures Ordinance”), or (ii) to “professional investors” as defined in the Securities and
Futures Ordinance and any rules made thereunder, or (iii) in other circumstances which do not result in the
document being a “prospectus” as defined in the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance, and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the Notes may be issued or may be in the
possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere),
which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong
(except if permitted to do so under the securities laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to Notes which
are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors”
in Hong Kong as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance and any rules made thereunder.

This Offering Memorandum has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of
Singapore. Accordingly, this Offering Memorandum and any other document or material in connection
with the offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the Notes may not be circulated or
distributed, nor may the Notes be offered or sold, or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or
purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other than (i) to an institutional investor
(as defined in Section 4A of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore, as modified or amended from
time to time (the “SFA”)) pursuant to Section 274 of the SFA, (ii) to a relevant person (as defined in
Section 275(2) of the SFA) pursuant to Section 275(1) of the SFA, or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A)
of the SFA, and in accordance with the conditions specified in Section 275 of the SFA, or (iii) otherwise
pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provision of the SFA.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act
of Japan (Act No. 25 of 1948, as amended), or the FIEA. The Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, in Japan or to or for the benefit of any resident of Japan (including any person resident in
Japan or any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan) or to others for reoffering or
resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to or for the benefit of any resident of Japan, except pursuant to an
exemption from the registration requirements of the FIEA and otherwise in compliance with any relevant
laws and regulations of Japan.

The Notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established market. We do not intend
to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for any quotation system to
quote them. There can be no assurance that a market for the Notes will develop, or if one does develop, it
may not provide adequate liquidity. Although the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make
a market for the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at
any time. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp
taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with this offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to
purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the
Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution


-----

has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering
transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or
cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If
the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at
any time.

**Plan of Distribution**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which activities may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking,
financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing
and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their affiliates have from time to time provided, and in the
future may provide, certain investment banking and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates, for
which they have received, and in the future would receive, customary fees. In addition, certain of the initial
purchasers and/or their affiliates may hold positions in the 4.250% 2025 Secured Notes that we intend to
redeem with the net proceeds from this offering, and these entities would receive a portion of the net
proceeds from this offering. Certain of the initial purchasers and their affiliates serve as counterparties to
certain derivative and hedging arrangements. In addition, from time to time, certain of the initial purchasers
and their affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account of customers, and hold on
behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in our debt or equity securities or loans, and
may do so in the future. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers
and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments including serving as
counterparties to certain derivative and hedging arrangements, and actively trade debt and equity securities
(or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account
and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities
and/or instruments of GFL. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
instruments and may at anytime hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions
in such securities and instruments. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship
with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those
initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary
risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure
by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of
short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default
swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about,
2024, which is the business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as
“T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the 1934 Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in one business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the initial T+ settlement will be required, by virtue of
the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of
any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to
the date of delivery hereunder should consult their own advisors.

will be deemed to have made the following acknowledgements, representations to and agreements with us
and the initial purchasers:

(1) You acknowledge that:

acceptance of the Notes will agree, that until the end of the Resale Restriction Period (as defined
below), the Notes may be offered, sold or otherwise transferred only:

minimum principal amount of the Notes of US$250,000; or

Notes or any predecessor of the Notes are first offered to persons other than distributors (as
defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S (the “Resale Restriction Period”),
and will not apply after the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends;

   - if a holder of the Notes proposes to resell or transfer the Notes under clause (e) above before
the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends, the seller must deliver to us and the Trustee a letter

things, that the purchaser is an institutional accredited investor that is acquiring the Notes not
for distribution in violation of the 1933 Act;
