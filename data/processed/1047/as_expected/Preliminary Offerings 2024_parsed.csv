Despite a careful process to prepare and review the forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the underlying opinions, estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct.

- an active, liquid and orderly trading market for the Notes failing to develop; - we are only responsible for the information contained, or incorporated by reference, in this Offering Memorandum; - ability to enforce civil liabilities against us and our directors and officers; - governing laws of GFL in Ontario, Canada could, in some cases, have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware, United States; - derivative actions, actions relating to breach of fiduciary duties and other matters relating to our internal affairs will be required to be litigated in Canada, which could limit shareholders’ ability to obtain a favourable judicial forum for disputes with us; - claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to us; - provisions of Canadian law may delay, prevent or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a significant portion of the GFL’s shares or assets; and - other factors that may be beyond our control. The opinions, estimates or assumptions referred to above and described in greater detail in “Risk _Factors” in the Form 40-F (as defined herein) should be considered carefully by readers._ These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with other cautionary statements contained, or incorporated by reference, in this Offering Memorandum. Although we have attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other risk factors not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking information. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. The forward-looking information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum represents our expectations as of the date of this Offering Memorandum (or as the date it is otherwise stated as of) and is subject to change after such date. However, we disclaim any intention or obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable laws. All of the forward-looking information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum is expressly qualified by the foregoing cautionary statements. Investors should read this entire Offering Memorandum and consult their own professional advisors to ascertain and assess the income tax, legal, risk factors and other aspects of their investment in the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,135

1047,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2244,NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES,2244.1,,2244.1.1,,"The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in other public disclosures of “non-GAAP financial measures,” which include, among others described below, Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner from non-GAAP liquidity measures; and - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to occur. With respect to foreign private issuers whose primary financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS or a home-country GAAP, references to “GAAP” in the definition of the “non-GAAP financial measure” discussed above refer to the principles under which those primary financial statements are prepared, which in our case is IFRS. We refer to the terms Acquisition EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA (each as defined below and together, the “Non-IFRS Measures”) in various places in this Offering Memorandum and in the information incorporated by reference herein. These are supplemental financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP. Any analysis of non-IFRS Measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP. The Non-IFRS Measures are not recognized terms under IFRS or U.S. GAAP. Certain of the adjustments used to derive these Non-IFRS Measures would not be allowed under Regulation S-X. In addition, our measurements of the Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to those of other companies. Please see “Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information” for a discussion of our use of the Non-IFRS Measures in this Offering Memorandum, including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and to investors, and a reconciliation of the relevant Non-IFRS Measures to the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP. These Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), cash flow from operating activities and other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of performance, but we believe these measures are useful to both our management and to investors in providing relative performance and measuring change. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. “Acquisition EBITDA” represents, for the applicable period, management’s estimates of the annual Adjusted EBITDA of an acquired business, based on its most recently available historical financial ----- information at the time of acquisition, as adjusted to give effect to (a) the elimination of expenses related to the prior owners and certain other costs and expenses that are not indicative of the underlying business performance, if any, as if such business had been acquired on the first day of such period and (b) contract and acquisition annualization for contracts entered into and acquisitions completed by such acquired business prior to our acquisition (collectively, “Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments”). Further adjustments are made to such annual Adjusted EBITDA to reflect estimated operating cost savings and synergies, if any, anticipated to be realized upon acquisition and integration of the business into our operations. Acquisition EBITDA is calculated net of divestitures. We use Acquisition EBITDA for the acquired businesses to adjust our Adjusted EBITDA to include a proportional amount of the Acquisition EBITDA of the acquired businesses based upon the respective number of months of operation for such period prior to the date of our acquisition of each such business. Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments are based on detailed financial due diligence in respect of the target business and account for (a) any known changes to the target business that are not yet fully reflected in the historical financial records and (b) planned cost saving initiatives to be implemented following the acquisition. Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments are intended to eliminate costs, expenses and benefits, that are not indicative of the underlying business performance of the acquired business, such as (i) one time revenues earned prior to our acquisition of the business, (ii) costs related to prior ownership, which generally reflect the elimination of compensation and other payments to the prior owners that are not considered necessary to operate the acquired business, and (iii) other costs and expenses such as temporary truck rentals, relocation expenses, bad debt expense and certain professional fees. Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments also reflect adjustments such as (i) contract annualization, which generally includes the incremental EBITDA that a particular contract commenced during the applicable period would have generated if such contract had commenced on the first day of the applicable fiscal period, (ii) acquisition annualization, which generally reflects the incremental revenue that a particular acquisition consummated by an acquired entity, but before we acquired such entity, during the applicable fiscal period would have generated if such acquisition had been consummated on the first day of the applicable fiscal period, and (iii) cost synergies anticipated to be realized in the near-term, which generally reflects estimated vehicle operating, administrative, labour and disposal cost savings anticipated to be realized upon the integration of an acquired business as if such cost savings were realized at the beginning of the period, each adjusted to Adjusted EBITDA. “Adjusted EBITDA” is a supplemental measure used by management and other users of our financial statements, including our lenders and investors, to assess the financial performance of our business without regard to financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA is also a key metric that management uses prior to execution of any strategic investing or financing opportunity. For example, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions, expansion opportunities, and dispositions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is utilized by financial institutions to measure borrowing capacity. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding and deducting, as applicable from EBITDA, certain expenses, costs, charges or benefits incurred in such period which in management’s view are either not indicative of underlying business performance or impact the ability to assess the operating performance of our business, including: (a) (gain) loss on foreign exchange, (b) (gain) loss on sale of property and equipment, (c) mark-to-market (gain) loss on Purchase Contracts, (d) share of net (income) loss of investments accounted for using the equity method for associates, (e) share-based payments, (f) (gain) loss on divestiture, (g) transaction costs, (h) acquisition, rebranding and other integration costs (included in cost of sales related to acquisition activity) and (i) other. We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis reflecting factors and trends affecting our business. As we continue to grow our business, we may be faced with new events or circumstances that are not indicative of our underlying business performance or that impact the ability to assess our operating performance. “EBITDA” represents, for the applicable period, net income (loss) from continuing operations plus (a) interest and other finance costs, plus (b) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, landfill assets and intangible assets, plus (less) (c) the provision (recovery) for income taxes, in each case to the extent deducted from or added to/from net income (loss) from continuing operations. We present EBITDA to assist readers in understanding the mathematical development of Adjusted EBITDA. Management does not use EBITDA as a financial performance metric. “Run-Rate EBITDA” represents Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable period as adjusted to give effect to management’s estimates of (a) Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments and (b) the impact of annualization of ----- certain new municipal and disposal contracts and cost savings initiatives, entered into, commenced or implemented, as applicable, in such period, as if such contracts or costs savings initiatives had been entered into, commenced or implemented, as applicable, on the first day of such period ((a) and (b), collectively, “Run-Rate EBITDA Adjustments”). Run-Rate EBITDA has not been adjusted to take into account the impact of the cancellation of contracts and cost increases associated with these contracts. These adjustments reflect monthly allocations of Acquisition EBITDA for the acquired businesses based on straight line proration. As a result, these estimates do not take into account the seasonality of a particular acquired business. While we do not believe the seasonality of any one acquired business is material when aggregated with other acquired businesses, the estimates may result in a higher or lower adjustment to our Run-Rate EBITDA than would have resulted had we adjusted for the actual results of each of the acquired businesses for the period prior to our acquisition. We primarily use Run-Rate EBITDA to show how GFL would have performed if each of the acquired businesses had been consummated at the start of the period as well as to show the impact of the annualization of certain new municipal and disposal contracts and cost savings initiatives. We also believe that Run-Rate EBITDA is useful to investors and creditors to monitor and evaluate our borrowing capacity and compliance with certain of our debt covenants. Run-Rate EBITDA as presented herein is calculated in accordance with the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,135

Total capital expenditures excludes asset acquisitions financed through capital leases, as disclosed in the audited annual consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum. (2) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA are not measures of performance in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/loss or operating cash flows determined in accordance with IFRS. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA in this Offering Memorandum is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-IFRS financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” Each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: - although amortization is a non-cash charge, the assets being amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and none of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA nor Run-Rate EBITDA reflects any cash requirements for such replacements; - none of them reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - none of them reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; ----- - none of them reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our significant amount of indebtedness; and - none of them reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and RunRate EBITDA should not be taken as representative of our future results of operations or financial position. For example, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may not _be able to achieve management’s estimate of the annualized Run-Rate EBITDA of the acquired businesses outlined under ‘Summary—Summary Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information’”._ Run-Rate EBITDA is not a measurement of our historical financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We present Run-Rate EBITDA because we believe it represents an estimate of the potential of our ongoing operations to generate recurring revenue and Adjusted EBITDA if the acquisitions referred to below had closed on the dates noted. These “as if” estimates of potential operating results were not prepared in accordance with IFRS or the pro forma rules of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. The presentation of Run-Rate EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be consistent with these “as if” estimates. Furthermore, while Run-Rate EBITDA gives effect to management’s estimate of a full year of Acquisition EBITDA in respect of acquisitions completed in the applicable period, Run-Rate EBITDA does not give effect to any Acquisition EBITDA in respect of such acquisitions for any period prior to such applicable period. As a result, the RunRate EBITDA across different periods may not necessarily be comparable. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Run-Rate EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. In addition, as described in more detail in notes to the tables set forth in this “Summary _Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information,” our Run-Rate EBITDA is based on a number of_ assumptions and estimates. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results of operations for each of the periods presented are significantly different from our Run-Rate EBITDA for those same periods as a result of the actual achievement of estimated revenues from new municipal and disposal contracts and cost saving initiatives, seasonality or otherwise. For more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations, see “Risk Factors.” Because of these limitations, Run-Rate EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our actual historical results and using Run-Rate EBITDA only for supplemental purposes. For a description of risks related to Run-Rate EBITDA, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to _our Business—Our Run-Rate EBITDA is based on certain estimates and assumptions and should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that we will achieve such operating results. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on our Run-Rate EBITDA and should make their own independent assessment of our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.”_ The following table reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate EBITDA to our net loss for the periods indicated: -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,135

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” we would have had approximately $9,191.4 million of Total Funded Debt (including the Notes), $5,807.2 million of secured indebtedness, including $276.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility (excluding $217.4 million of letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility). We would have had availability for revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $813.2 million (including $182.6 million in letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility). Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of the Notes. For example: - it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and other indebtedness; - our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions may be limited; - we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes; - it could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; - it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - it could expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including certain of our borrowings under the Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest; - it could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; - our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a significant adverse effect on us; and - it could increase our cost of borrowing. Although the terms of the Credit Facilities, Existing Indentures and the Indenture contain or will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, debt incurrence in compliance with these ----- restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries’ current debt levels, the related risks that we or our subsidiaries now face could be magnified. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture contain or will contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest.

This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes. There can be no guarantee that our business will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility, in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the Existing Notes and the Notes, as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this is the case, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the Notes, on or before maturity, and we cannot assure holders of Notes that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the Notes, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners. These financing strategies may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing and/or to do so on commercially reasonable terms will depend on, among other things: - our financial condition at the time; - restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the Existing Indentures; - the Indenture; and - other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the environmental services industry. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations, including payments due on the Notes. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Notes and the Existing Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all borrowings thereunder due and payable and/or terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could foreclose or otherwise enforce their security interests against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into receivership, bankruptcy or liquidation.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants. Future indebtedness or other contracts could contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those contained in the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures or the Indenture. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, regulations, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure holders of the Notes that we will be able to comply with the covenants in the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures or the Indenture, including failure as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which may cause cross-default to other debt. In addition, an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility would permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Facilities, those lenders, as applicable, could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be: - limited in how we conduct our business; - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate; or - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

The Indenture will permit us to calculate our capacity to make restricted payments in a manner similar to our Existing Indentures. As of March 31, 2024, we had restricted payment build-up capacity of $6,869.3 million. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with you in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company.

All of those borrowings would likely be secured indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels or cash is used to make restricted payments, the related risks that the Issuer and the Guarantors now face could intensify.

The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend upon not only their operating results, cash flow, financial condition, business and tax considerations, legal and regulatory restrictions, and economic conditions, but also on applicable law and contractual restrictions contained in instruments governing their indebtedness. Unless they are guarantors of the Notes or our other indebtedness, GFL’s subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose.

However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale to make the required repurchase of the Notes and the Existing Notes or that restrictions under the Credit Facilities will not allow such repurchases. Our ability to repurchase the Notes and the Existing Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The indentures governing the Existing Notes also contain similar change of control offer provisions. The occurrence of the events constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale Offer under the Indenture and the Existing Indentures may constitute a default under the Credit Facilities and may result in an event of default in respect of our and our subsidiaries’ other current or future indebtedness and, consequently, the lenders thereof may have the right to require repayment of such indebtedness in full. The source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes and the Existing Notes and repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. Moreover, the exercise by holders of Notes of their right to require us to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale Offer could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale Offer itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. Our failure to repurchase the Notes would be an event of default under the Indenture and the Existing Indentures and also under the Credit Facilities. See “Description of _Notes—Offers to Repurchase.”_ In the event a Change of Control Offer is required to be made at a time when we are prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibitions. If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from repurchasing the Notes. In that case, our failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness. Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes and events of default and potential breaches of the Credit Facilities, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the Indenture, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the Notes.

In such case, the holders of the Notes may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price.

Even if an active trading market for the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your Notes.

In the event that we become insolvent or are liquidated, a Noteholder’s rights to enforce remedies under the Notes could be delayed or impaired by the restructuring provisions of applicable federal bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought by us or others with respect to us. For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) (“BIA”) and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (“CCAA”) contain provisions enabling an “insolvent person” to obtain a stay of proceedings against its creditors and others and to prepare and file a restructuring proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement to be voted on by the various classes of its affected creditors. A restructuring proposal, compromise or arrangement, if accepted by the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors, and if approved by the relevant Canadian court, would be binding on all creditors within each affected class, including those that did not vote to accept the proposal, compromise or arrangement. Furthermore, this legislation permits the insolvent person to retain possession and administration of its property, subject to court oversight, even though that debtor may be in default under the applicable debt instrument during the period the stay against proceedings remains in place. In this regard, the approval threshold requirements provided in the Indenture for modification of certain rights of the holders of Notes may be disregarded. In an insolvency or bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the applicable statute or the court will establish the approval threshold. The approval threshold requirements under the Indenture may also be disregarded in a restructuring by way of a court approved arrangement under a Canadian corporate statute. Stays of proceedings have also been granted in connection with these corporate debt restructurings. ----- The powers of the court under the BIA, the CCAA in particular, and other Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation, have been exercised broadly to protect an entity attempting to restructure its affairs from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the Notes or the Note Guarantees would be made during any proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring or whether and to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs. In addition, while GFL US is incorporated in Delaware, GFL and certain of the subsidiaries expected to be Guarantors are incorporated or otherwise existing under the laws of Canada (or provinces thereof, as the case may be). However, GFL US and certain of the subsidiaries expected to be Guarantors are incorporated or otherwise existing under the laws of the United States and future subsidiaries that become Guarantors, if any, may be formed or otherwise existing under the laws of the United States or another jurisdiction outside of Canada, and/or their respective principal operating assets are or could be located in such jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Under bankruptcy laws in the United States, courts typically have jurisdiction over a debtor’s property, wherever located, including property situated in other countries. A Noteholder’s rights under the Notes and the Note Guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and courts in one jurisdiction may not recognize the jurisdiction of another court. Accordingly, difficulties may arise in administering a bankruptcy case involving a Canadian debtor with assets located in the United States, and any orders or judgments of a bankruptcy court in Canada or the United States may not be enforceable in the other jurisdiction. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. A judgment by a Canadian or other foreign court relating to any Note or to a Note Guarantee or relating to the enforcement of a foreign judgment in respect of a Note or Note Guarantee may be awarded only in Canadian currency or the relevant foreign local currency, as the case may be, and such judgment may be based on a rate of exchange in existence on a day other than the day of payment. The Note Guarantees provided will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York. A judgment by a U.S. court relating to the Note Guarantee or relating to the enforcement of a foreign judgment in respect of the Note Guarantee may be awarded in U.S. currency and such judgment may be based on a rate of exchange in existence on a day other than the day of payment. Your rights under the Notes and Notes Guarantees will be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, and other laws of the respective Guarantors’ jurisdictions of incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another and those of the United States in certain areas, including creditors’rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes or Note Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,135
1047,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Notes,13.2.17,Investors in Notes may have difficulties enforcing certain civil liabilities.,"While GFL US is a Delaware corporation, GFL is incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and only certain of GFL US’s Guarantors are incorporated or otherwise exist under the laws of the United States. Some of the controlling persons of GFL are residents of Canada, and certain of its directors and officers, as well as certain of the experts named in this Offering Memorandum, are residents of Canada, and all or a substantial portion of their assets and a significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for holders of the Notes to effect service of process within the United States upon Canadian Guarantors or the directors, officers and experts who are not residents of the United States, or within Canada upon United States Guarantors or the directors, officers and experts who are not residents of Canada, or to realize in one country upon judgments of courts of another country predicated upon civil liability under federal, territorial or state securities laws or other laws of ----- another jurisdiction. There are defenses that can be raised to the enforceability, in original actions in Canadian courts, of liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S. and to the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S., such that the enforcement in Canada of such liabilities and judgments is not certain. Therefore, it may not be possible to enforce those judgments against us, certain of our directors and officers or some of the experts named in this Offering Memorandum.

Such covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force.

While the relevant laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, the entering into of the Note Guarantees could be found to be a fraudulent transfer, conveyance or preference or a transfer at undervalue or otherwise void, or the court could make an order requiring the repayment of funds received if a court was to determine that, among other things: - the Note Guarantee was given or payment made with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud the existing or future creditors of the Guarantor; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration for the delivery of the Note Guarantee; or - the Guarantor was insolvent at the time it delivered the Note Guarantee or was rendered insolvent by the giving of the Note Guarantee. We cannot predict: (i) what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether a Guarantor was insolvent as of the date it issued the Note Guarantee, or whether, regardless of the method of valuation, ----- a court would determine that the Guarantor was insolvent on that date; or (ii) whether a court would determine that the payments under the Note Guarantee constituted fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. To the extent a court voids a Note Guarantee as a fraudulent transfer, preference or conveyance or a transfer at undervalue, or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, the applicable trustee and the holders of the Notes would cease to have any direct claim against such Guarantor. If a court were to take this action, the Guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the Guarantor’s liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock claims, if any, before any portion of its assets could be distributed to us to be applied to the payment of the Notes. If a court were to conclude that a Note Guarantee should be subordinated for equitable reasons to claims of other creditors of a Guarantor, then those other creditors must be satisfied before any portion of the assets of that Guarantor would be available to satisfy its Note Guarantee. We cannot assure you that a Guarantor’s remaining assets would be sufficient to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes relating to any voided portions or subordinated portions of the Note Guarantees. In addition, the corporate statutes or other instruments governing the Guarantors may also have provisions that serve to protect each Guarantor’s creditors from impairment of its capital from financial assistance given to its affiliates where there are reasonable grounds to believe that, as a consequence of this financial assistance, the Guarantor could be rendered insolvent or the book value, or in some cases the realizable value, of its assets would be less than the sum of its liabilities and its issued and paid-up share capital.

The terms of the Notes and any Additional Notes that may be subsequently issued under the Indenture will be substantially identical other than the issuance dates. Because, however, any Additional Notes may not be fungible with the Notes for federal income tax purposes, they may have a different CUSIP number or numbers, be represented by a different Global Note or Global Notes, and otherwise be treated as a separate class or classes of notes from the Notes for other purposes.

The Issuer will make each interest payment on the Notes to the Holders of record as of the close of business on the and preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date. The initial Interest Payment Date for the Notes offered hereunder will be, 2024. Solely for purposes of disclosure under the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which interest is calculated under a Note for any period in any calendar year (the “Calculation Period”) is equivalent to the rate payable under a Note in respect of the Calculation Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in such calendar year and the denominator of which is the actual number of days in the Calculation Period.

Each Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor and will rank: - equal in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including any Indebtedness or guarantee under the Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes, as applicable); - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor; - effectively junior to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s Indebtedness or guarantee under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness; and - structurally junior to all Indebtedness and other liabilities of any Subsidiary of GFL that is not a Guarantor. As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds”: - we would have had outstanding approximately $9,191.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Total Funded Debt (including the Notes); - we would have had remaining availability for revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $813.2 million (after giving effect to utilization of $217.4 million in letters of credit); and - we would have had outstanding $5,807.2 million of Secured Indebtedness. As of March 31, 2024, GFL’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors collectively had: - liabilities of $595.2 million (4.7% of our consolidated total liabilities); and - assets of $1,018.9 million (5.1% of our consolidated total assets). For Fiscal 2023, GFL’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors collectively generated revenue of $215.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $59.5 million, which includes intercompany transactions with GFL and the Guarantors. A significant portion of the operations of GFL are conducted through GFL’s Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of any Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors and creditors holding Indebtedness or guarantees issued by such Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, and claims of preferred stockholders of such Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors over the claims of our creditors, including Holders, even if such claims do not constitute senior Indebtedness. Accordingly, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders, if any, of such Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes an offer to purchase the Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, or a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer by the Issuer or a third party may be made in advance of a ----- Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified before or after the occurrence of such Change of Control with the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Neither GFL nor the Issuer has a present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit rating. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would constitute a default under the Credit Agreements. Future Credit Facilities of the Issuer may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Credit Facilities to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Credit Facilities, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then-existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the offer required by the Indenture on a Change of Control Triggering Event or occurrence of certain asset sales.”_ The definition of Change of Control includes a reference to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the reference under applicable law. Accordingly, whether or not the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. _Asset Sales_ GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale in any single transaction or series of related transactions unless: (1) GFL (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (measured as of the date of the definitive agreement relating to such Asset Sale) of the assets, properties or Equity Interests issued, sold or otherwise disposed of in such Asset Sale; (2) at least 75% of the consideration received for such Asset Sale (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), together with all Asset Sales since February 1, 2016 (on a cumulative basis) received by GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the manner referred to in clause (1) above is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents, or Permitted Assets. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash: (a) any liabilities of GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities or liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee), as shown on GFL’s most recent internally available annual or quarterly balance sheet, that are (i) assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation agreement or similar agreement that releases GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability or (ii) otherwise canceled; ----- (b) any securities, notes or other obligations (including earn-outs and similar obligations) received by GFL or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are, within 180 days of the applicable Asset Sale, converted by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion; (c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that GFL and its other Restricted Subsidiaries are released from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the Asset Sale; and (d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value (with the Fair Market Value of such item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time of contractually agreeing to the related Asset Sale), taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $90.0 million and (ii) 3.0% of Total Assets measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale. Within 455 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (or, at the Issuer’s option, any earlier date), GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary may apply those Net Proceeds for any combination of the following purposes: (1) to Repay Indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and/or any other Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien (other than any such Indebtedness that is subordinate in right of payment to the Notes or any Note Guarantee); (2) to Repay (a) obligations under the Notes, (b) other Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall so reduce obligations under other Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (b), the Issuer will equally and ratably reduce obligations in respect of the Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” or through open-market purchases (which may be below par) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event that the Notes were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the pro rata principal amount of Notes or (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, in each case other than Indebtedness owed to GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL; (3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or to acquire Capital Stock of, a Person that is engaged in a Permitted Business and that, in the case of an acquisition of Capital Stock, is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL; (4) to make a capital expenditure; or (5) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business or that replace, in whole or in part, the properties or assets that are subject to the Asset Sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries enters into a binding agreement committing to make an acquisition, expenditure or investment in compliance with clauses (3), (4) or (5) above within 455 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (an “Acceptable Commitment”), such commitment will be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of the execution of such agreement until the earlier of (i) the date on which such acquisition or investment is consummated or such expenditure made or such agreement is terminated, and (ii) the 180th day after the expiration of the aforementioned 455-day period; provided that if any Acceptable Commitment is later canceled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds from and after the date of such cancelation or termination; unless GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (a “Second Commitment”) in which case such commitment will be treated as a permitted ----- application of the Net Proceeds from the date of the execution of such agreement until the earlier of (i) the date on which such acquisition or investment is consummated or such expenditure made or such agreement is terminated, and (ii) the 180th day after the date of the Second Commitment. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer or GFL may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraphs (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (2) above, will be deemed to have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted) will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” If the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $60.0 million, the Issuer will make a pro rata offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of Notes (and, at the option of the Issuer, to holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, issued with a significant original issue discount) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (subject to the procedures of the relevant depositary), on the basis of the aggregate principal amounts (or accreted values) tendered in round denominations (which, in the case of the Notes, will be minimum denominations of US$2,000 principal amount and multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof). If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds at any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds before the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $60.0 million. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the Asset Sale Offer purchase date is after the taking of a record of the Holders on a Record Date and on or before the related Interest Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name a purchased Note is registered on such Record Date, and no other interest will be payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer. The Issuer will comply with all applicable securities legislation of Canada and the United States, including, without limitation, the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the 1934 Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws and regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with such laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified before or after the occurrence of an Asset Sale with the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, will be governed by the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Certain Covenants—Amalgamation, Merger, _Consolidation or Sale of Assets” and will not be subject to the provisions described above in this section_ entitled “—Asset Sales.” -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,135
1047,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.11,Certain Covenants,124.11.1,,"_Covenant Suspension_ If on any date following the Issue Date: (1) the Notes are rated Investment Grade by any two Approved Rating Organizations; and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (1) and (2) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”) then, beginning on that day and at all times thereafter until the Reinstatement Date (“Suspension Period”), and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Offering Memorandum will be suspended: (1) “—Offers to Repurchase—Asset Sales”; (2) “—Restricted Payments”; (3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”; (4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Amalgamation, Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”; (6) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and (7) “—Issuance of Note Guarantees”, (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”). During any Suspension Period, the Board of Directors of GFL may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described below under the caption “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” In the event that GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the preceding paragraph and, on a subsequent date, at least one of the Approved Rating Organizations which rates the Notes withdraws its Investment Grade rating, or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade rating, or ceases to rate the Notes (in each case, such date, the “Reinstatement Date”), then GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries will after the Reinstatement Date again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events for the benefit of the Notes. On the Reinstatement Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be subject to the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of _Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock.” To the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock_ would not be so permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to such covenant, such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4) of the second paragraph of such covenant. Calculations made after the Reinstatement Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described below under the caption “—Restricted Payments” will be made as though such covenant had been in effect from the Issue Date and throughout the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Restricted Payments” to the extent provided therein. For purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting _Restricted Subsidiaries,” on the Reinstatement Date, any contractual encumbrances or restrictions of the_ type specified in clauses (1), (2) or (3) of the first paragraph of that covenant entered into (or which GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary of GFL became legally obligated to enter into) during the Suspension Period ----- will be deemed to have been in effect on the Issue Date, so that they are permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph of that covenant. For purposes of the covenant described under “—Offers to Repurchase—Asset Sales,” on the Reinstatement Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero. For purposes of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” any contract, agreement, loan, advance or guarantee with or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of GFL entered into (or which GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary of GFL became legally obligated to enter into) during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect as of the Issue Date for purposes of clause (5) of the second paragraph of such covenant. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated: (1) no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or on the Reinstatement Date) or after the Suspension Period based solely on events that occurred during the Suspension Period; and (2) neither (a) the continued existence, after the Reinstatement Date, of facts and circumstances or obligations that were incurred or otherwise came into existence during a Suspension Period nor (b) the performance of any such obligations, shall constitute a breach of any covenant set forth in the Indenture or cause a Default or Event of Default thereunder; provided that (1) GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries did not incur or otherwise cause such facts and circumstances or obligations to exist in anticipation of the Notes ceasing to be rated Investment Grade, and (2) the Issuer reasonably believed that such incurrence or actions would not result in such ceasing. _Restricted Payments_ GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of GFL’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation involving GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of GFL’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than (i) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL, or in warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL, and (ii) dividends or distributions payable to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries); (2) purchase, retract, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation involving GFL), in whole or in part, any Equity Interests of GFL (other than any such Equity Interests owned by GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary); (3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Indebtedness, except for (i) a payment of interest at the Stated Maturity thereof or of principal not earlier than one year prior to the Stated Maturity thereof and (ii) any such Indebtedness owed to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (4) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”) unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment: (a) in the case of a Restricted Payment other than a Restricted Investment, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment and in the case of a Restricted Investment, no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2), (6), (9) or (10) under the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and _Remedies” has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;_ ----- (b) GFL would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable fourquarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of _Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”; and_ (c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries after February 1, 2016 (other than pursuant to clauses (3) through (18) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of: (i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income for the period (taken as one accounting period) from February 1, 2016 to the end of GFL’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal annual or quarterly financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a loss, less 100% of such loss (which amount in this clause (i) may not be less than zero); plus (ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by GFL since February 1, 2016 (A) as a contribution to its common equity capital, (B) from the issue or sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL, (C) from the issue or sale of warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL, and (D) from the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of t GFL or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of GFL, in each case that have been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL or warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL (in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (A) through (D), other than (1) a contribution from, or Capital Stock, Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to, a Subsidiary of GFL) or (2) Excluded Contributions; plus (iii) 100% of the Fair Market Value of property other than cash received by GFL since February 1, 2016 in consideration of (or in exchange for) its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock); plus (iv) 100% of the principal amount of any Indebtedness, or the liquidation preference or maximum fixed repurchase price, as the case may be, of any Disqualified Stock of GFL issued after February 1, 2016 (other than Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock issued to a Restricted Subsidiary) which has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of GFL (other than Disqualified Stock); plus (v) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after February 1, 2016 is (A) sold for cash or otherwise cancelled, liquidated, or repaid for cash, or (B) in the case of a Restricted Investment constituting a guarantee, released, the initial amount of such Restricted Investment (or, if less, in the case of a sale, cancellation, liquidation or repayment for cash described in the foregoing subclause (A), the amount of cash received upon such sale, cancellation, liquidation or repayment), in each case, to the extent that any such payments or proceeds are not already included in Consolidated Net Income of GFL for the applicable period; provided, for certainty, that any amount that would otherwise be included in this clause (v) as a result of the release of a guarantee due to the payment thereunder by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments; plus (vi) upon a redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, the lesser of (A) the Fair Market Value of GFL’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Investments in such Subsidiary as at the date of such redesignation and (B) the Fair Market Value of such Investments at the date on which such Subsidiary was originally designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; plus ----- (vii) 100% of any dividends or distributions received in cash by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from any Unrestricted Subsidiary after February 1, 2016, to the extent not already included in Consolidated Net Income of GFL for the applicable period; plus (viii) 100% of the aggregate amount of Retained Declined Proceeds. As of March 31, 2024, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (c) was approximately $6,869.3 million. The preceding provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment by GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary of any dividend or distribution, or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption of any Subordinated Indebtedness, within 60 days after the date of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the giving of the notice of redemption, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice the dividend or distribution or redemption of such Subordinated Indebtedness would have been permitted by the Indenture; (2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the Net Cash Proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of GFL) of, Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL or warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL;

(7) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of any Equity Interests of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries held by any current or former officer, director, employee or consultant (or their transferees, estates or beneficiaries) of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant ----- to any equity subscription agreement, shareholder agreement, employment agreement, stock option plan, equity incentive or other plan or similar agreement, in each case in effect as of the Issue Date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $70.0 million and (y) 1.5% of Total Assets in each calendar year of GFL (with unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to the immediately succeeding three calendar years);

(iii) to finance any Investment permitted to be made pursuant to this covenant; provided that (A) such Restricted Payment shall be made substantially concurrently with the closing of such Investment and (B) such Persons shall, promptly following the closing thereof, cause (1) all property acquired (whether assets or Equity Interests) to be contributed to GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary or (2) the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets (to the extent permitted under the caption “—Amalgamation, _Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets”) of the Person formed in order to consummate_ such Investment or acquired pursuant to such Investment, as applicable, into or to, as applicable, GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary; (iv) the proceeds of which shall be used to pay (or make Restricted Payments to allow any direct or indirect parent thereof to pay) fees and expenses related to any equity or debt offering permitted by the Indenture (whether or not successful); (v) the proceeds of which (A) shall be used to pay customary salary, bonus, severance and other benefits payable to, and indemnities provided on behalf of, directors, officers, employees, members of management and consultants of such Persons and any payroll, social security or similar taxes in connection therewith to the extent such salaries, bonuses and other benefits are attributable to the ownership or operation of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries or (B) shall be used to make payments permitted under clauses ----- (1), (3), (8) and (9) (but only to the extent such payments have not been and are not expected to be made by GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary); (vi) the proceeds of which will be used to make payments due or expected to be due to cover social security, Medicare, employment insurance, statutory pension plan, withholding and other taxes payable and other remittances to governmental authorities in connection with any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement of such Persons or to make any other payment that would, if made by GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary, be permitted under the Indenture; (vii) the proceeds of which shall be used to pay cash, in lieu of issuing fractional shares, in connection with the exercise of warrants, options or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Equity Interests of such Persons; and (viii) for any taxable period for which GFL and/or any of its Subsidiaries are members of a consolidated, combined or similar income Tax group for Tax purposes of which a direct or indirect parent of GFL is the common parent (a “Tax Group”), the proceeds of which are necessary to permit the common parent of such Tax Group to pay the portion of any income Tax of such Tax Group for such taxable period that is attributable to the income of GFL and/or its Subsidiaries; provided that (A) the amount of such Restricted Payments for any taxable period shall not exceed that amount of such Taxes that GFL and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, would have paid had GFL and/or its applicable Subsidiaries, as applicable, been a stand-alone taxpayer (or a stand-alone group) for all applicable tax years and (B) the amount of such Restricted Payments in respect of an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be permitted only to the extent that cash distributions were made by such Unrestricted Subsidiary to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for such purpose; provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment made in reliance on clause (15), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, if a proposed Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through (18) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, divide and classify (or later reclassify in whole or in part, from time to time in its sole discretion) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1) through (18) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in any manner that complies with this covenant. For the purposes of determining compliance with any Canadian dollar or other currency denominated restriction on Restricted Payments denominated in a foreign currency, the Canadian dollar or other currency-equivalent amount of such Restricted Payment shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date that such Restricted Payment was made. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Restricted Payments that GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may make pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The amount of each Restricted Payment (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant will not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture. _Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock_ GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (in any such case, “incur”) any Indebtedness, and GFL will not issue any shares of Disqualified ----- Stock or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock; provided, however, that GFL may incur Indebtedness or issue shares of Disqualified Stock (in each case, including Acquired Indebtedness) and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (in each case, including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, if immediately after and giving effect thereto, either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for GFL’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been not less than 2.0 to 1.0, or (y) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 6.75:1.00, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided that Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or preferred stock if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom) the amount of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors that would be outstanding pursuant to this paragraph would exceed in aggregate the greater of (i) $45.0 million and (ii) 1.5% of Total Assets. The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”): (1) the incurrence by GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities (with letters of guarantee, tender checks and letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed the sum of (i) the greater of (x) $4,350.0 million and (y) the maximum amount such that after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional Indebtedness and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio of GFL would be no greater than 5.50 to 1.00 plus (ii) the greater of (x) $400.0 million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters for which internal annual or quarterly financial statements are available calculated in a manner consistent with any pro forma adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, at any one time outstanding; provided that for the purposes of determining the amount that can be incurred under clause (i)(y) hereof all Indebtedness incurred under clauses (i)(y) shall be deemed to be Secured Indebtedness; (2) Indebtedness incurred under Credit Facilities or otherwise in connection with one or more standby letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, completion guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds, appeal bonds or surety bonds or other similar reimbursement obligations, in each case, issued in the ordinary course of business (including for the purpose of providing security for environmental reclamation obligations to government agencies, workers’ compensation claims, payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar statutory and other requirements) and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of an advance or credit; (3) the incurrence by the Issuer of Indebtedness represented by the Notes issued on the Issue Date and the incurrence by the Guarantors of the Note Guarantees; (4) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness or Attributable Debt (including obligations represented by Financing Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations), in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of design, lease, expansion, construction, maintenance, upgrade, installation, development, improvement, replacement or repair of property (real or personal), plant or equipment or other assets used in the business of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Equity Interests of any Person owning such assets, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount, including all outstanding Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed the greater of (i) $145.0 million and (ii) 5.0% of Total Assets as of any date of incurrence (after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom); ----- (5) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness and any guarantees with respect thereto; (6) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness between or among GFL and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) that was incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (3), (4), (5), (6) or (12) of the definition of Permitted Debt; (7) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among GFL and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL; and (b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (7); (8) the issuance of preferred stock by any Restricted Subsidiary of GFL to GFL or to any other Restricted Subsidiary of GFL; provided, however, that (a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL; and (b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (8); (9) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes; (10) the guarantee by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness of GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant (including, for greater certainty, Note Guarantees in respect of Additional Notes so permitted to be incurred); provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated in right of payment to or pari passu in right of payment with the Notes or any of the Note Guarantees, then the guarantee must be subordinated in right of payment or pari passu in right of payment to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed; (11) Indebtedness of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries arising (i) from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business or (ii) in connection with endorsement of instruments for deposit in the ordinary course of business; (12) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Cash Management Obligations in the ordinary course of business; (13) the incurrence of (1) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock (i) of GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred or assumed in connection with an acquisition of any assets (including Capital Stock), business or Person or Investment and (ii) of any Person that is acquired by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or merged into or consolidated or amalgamated with GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and (2) Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock issued or, in each case, assumed in anticipation of, or in connection with, an acquisition of any assets, business or Person; provided, that after giving effect to such acquisition, merger, consolidation or amalgamation and the incurrence of such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, either (a) (i) GFL would be permitted to incur at least ----- $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is equal to or greater than immediately prior to such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or to such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or acquisition; or (b) (i) GFL would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries is equal to or less than immediately prior to such Investment, acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation; (14) the incurrence by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable), including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (14), not to exceed the greater of (i) $240.0 million and (ii) 60% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters for which internal annual or quarterly financial statements are available calculated in a manner consistent with any _pro forma adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge_ Coverage Ratio; (15) Indebtedness consisting of (i) the financing of insurance premiums in an amount not to exceed, at any time outstanding, the greater of (a) $30.0 million and (b) 1.0% of Total Assets determined at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness (after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom) or (ii) take-or-pay obligations contained in supply arrangements, in each case, in the ordinary course of business; (16) additional Indebtedness of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries to fund an acquisition or Investment in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the greater of (a) $130.0 million and (b) 4.0% of Total Assets determined at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness (after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom); provided that no Event of Default shall be continuing at the time the relevant agreement with respect to such acquisition or Investment is entered into; (17) Indebtedness incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor which, when aggregated with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (17) and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of (i) $45.0 million and (ii) 1.5% of Total Assets determined at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness (after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom); and (18) Contribution Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock” covenant: (1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (2) through (18) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to divide and classify (or later redivide and reclassify in whole or in part) such item of Indebtedness in whole or in part in any manner that complies with this covenant, including by allocation to more than one other type of Indebtedness, except that Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements that is outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date under clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt above and may not be reclassified, other than within such clause (1). Amounts incurred under clause (ii) of the above clause (1) of Permitted Debt, may, and will automatically be, reclassified into clause (i) thereof to the extent of the availability under such clause (i); (2) at the time of incurrence, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (2) through (18) above (or any portion thereof) without giving pro forma ----- effect to the Indebtedness incurred pursuant to any other provision of this covenant when calculating the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to any such clause or paragraph; (3) the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once, and any obligations arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness shall not be double counted; (4) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of any Person (i) existing at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL or is merged into, amalgamated with or consolidated with GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (ii) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from such Person (any Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), “Acquired Indebtedness”) shall be deemed to have been incurred or issued by a Restricted Subsidiary at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that any such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock that is redeemed, defeased, retired or otherwise repaid at the time of or immediately upon the consummation of the transaction by which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL (or is merged into, amalgamated with or consolidated with GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be) will be deemed not to have been incurred or issued for the purposes of this covenant; (5) the accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, as applicable, with the same, or less onerous, terms (as determined in good faith by the Issuer), the reclassification of preferred stock of the Issuer or any Guarantor as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends or the making of any distribution on Disqualified Stock or preferred stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the accrual of dividends on Disqualified Stock or preferred stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an Issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; (6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are incurred pursuant to Credit Facilities and are being treated as incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness will not constitute Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant; and (7) in the event that GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including letters of guarantee, tender checks and letters of credit thereunder) may be determined, at the election of the Issuer, on the date of such revolving credit facility or on the date of such increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and including letters of guarantee, tender checks and letters of credit thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or and including letters of guarantee, tender checks or letters of credit thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this paragraph shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable). For purposes of determining compliance with any Canadian dollar or other currency denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Canadian dollar or other currency-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or ----- first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower Canadian dollar or other currency-equivalent), in the case of revolving credit borrowings. However, if the Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable Canadian dollar or other currency denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Canadian dollar or other currency denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced (except to the extent necessary to pay all fees, defeasance costs, expenses and premiums (including tender premiums) incurred in connection therewith). Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any additional Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of such Person unless such additional Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the applicable Note Guarantee, as the case may be, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis. _Liens_ GFL will not, and will not permit the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien upon or with respect to any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, securing Indebtedness, unless: (1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property or assets that is senior in priority to such Liens (for as long as such Indebtedness is so secured); (2) in all other cases, the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property or assets equally and ratably with the obligation or liability secured by such Liens (for as long as such Indebtedness is so secured); or (3) such Lien is a Permitted Lien. _Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_ GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or pay any Indebtedness owed to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that the priority of any preferred stock over common stock in receiving dividends or distributions (upon a liquidation or otherwise) shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock; (2) make loans or advances to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (it being understood that the subordination of loans or advances made to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to other Indebtedness incurred by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances); or (3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries. ----- However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (1) agreements or instruments (including agreements governing Existing Indebtedness or Credit Facilities) as in effect or which came into effect on the Issue Date; (2) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees; (3) applicable law, rule, regulation, order, approval, license or permit; (4) any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred or issued in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred or issued, as the case may be; (5) customary non-assignment and non-subletting provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business; (6) agreements relating to Purchase Money Obligations, Financing Lease Obligations and Sale and Lease-Back Transactions that impose restrictions on the property relating thereto of the nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph; (7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of assets or Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL that restricts transfers of such assets or the making by that Restricted Subsidiary of distributions, loans or advances pending such sale or other disposition; (8) Permitted Liens that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens; (9) provisions in joint venture agreements, partnership agreements, limited liability company agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or with the approval of the Board of Directors of GFL or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary of GFL, that limit the disposition or distribution of assets or property, which limitations are applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements (including restrictions on the transfer of ownership interests in any joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or other applicable entity); (10) restrictions on cash, Cash Equivalents or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; (11) encumbrances and restrictions contained in contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of, or from the ability of GFL and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to realize the value of, property or assets of GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary; (12) agreements encumbering or restricting cash or marketable securities to secure Hedging Obligations; (13) agreements governing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”; _provided that GFL determines in good faith, on the date of incurrence thereof, that the restrictions_ therein will not materially adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes; ----- (14) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive (taken as a whole), than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced; and (15) any amendments, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings (collectively, “refinancings”) of the agreements, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (1) through (14) above; provided that such refinancings are not materially more restrictive (taken as a whole) with respect to such encumbrances and restrictions than those in effect prior to such refinancings, as determined in good faith by the Issuer. _Amalgamation, Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_ Neither the Issuer nor GFL may, in any transaction or series of transactions: (1) amalgamate, merge or consolidate with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer or GFL is the surviving Person); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person; unless: (1) either (a) the Issuer or GFL is the surviving entity; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such amalgamation, merger or consolidation (if other than the Issuer or GFL) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of Canada or any province thereof or the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia (in each of clauses (a) and (b), GFL, the Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); (2) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer or GFL) assumes all the obligations of the Issuer or GFL under the Notes and the Indenture either by operation of law or pursuant to an assumption agreement or other instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (3) immediately after such transaction or series of transactions, and giving pro forma effect to any related financing transactions, no Default or Event of Default exists; (4) on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either (a) GFL or the Successor Company (if other than GFL), will be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test or the Total Net Leverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock” or (b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is equal to or greater than it was immediately prior thereto or (y) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or less than the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and (5) the Issuer or GFL, as applicable, has delivered to the Trustee (i) an opinion of counsel stating that such transaction and, if an assumption agreement or other instrument is required in connection with such transaction, such assumption agreement or other instrument complies with clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant, and (ii) an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent contained in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, GFL or the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as applicable, and GFL or the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (1) any Subsidiary of GFL may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; and ----- (2) GFL may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into an Affiliate of GFL solely for the purpose of reincorporating GFL in Canada or any province thereof or the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia. A Subsidiary Guarantor may not, in any transaction or series of transactions: (1) amalgamate, consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets to another Person, other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL (in the case of either (1) or (2) above), unless: (1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, and giving pro forma effect to any related financing transactions, no Default or Event of Default exists; (2) either: (a) (x) such Guarantor is the surviving entity or (y) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such amalgamation, merger or consolidation assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, either by operation of law or pursuant to an assumption agreement or other instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (in each of clauses (x) and (y), such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Person”); or (b) such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “Offers to Repurchase—Asset Sales”; and (3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee (i) an opinion of counsel stating that such transaction and, if an assumption agreement or other instrument is required in connection with such transaction, such assumption agreement or other instrument complies with clause (2)(a) of this covenant and (ii) an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent contained in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. The Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Note Guarantee and such Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor may (i) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into an Affiliate of GFL solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Subsidiary Guarantor in Canada or any province thereof or the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (ii) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Subsidiary Guarantor or a jurisdiction in Canada or any province thereof or the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia or (iii) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Board of Directors of GFL or the senior management of GFL determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of GFL and is not materially disadvantageous to the Holders, in each case, without regard to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph. For purposes of this covenant, transfers among or between GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be disregarded. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. _Transactions with Affiliates_ GFL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or ----- guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of GFL (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in excess of $20.0 million for any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions, unless: (a) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to GFL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that would reasonably be expected to have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time by GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in an arm’s-length dealing with a Person who is not an Affiliate of GFL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be; and (b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $40.0 million, GFL delivers to the Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of GFL set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction or series of Affiliate Transactions, as the case may be, complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction or series of Affiliate Transactions, as the case may be, has been approved in good faith by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of GFL. The following items will be deemed not to be Affiliate Transactions and therefore will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph: (1) any consulting or employment agreement or arrangement, employee or director compensation, stock option, bonus, benefit or other similar plan, officer or director indemnification, insurance, severance or expense reimbursement arrangement, or any similar arrangement existing on the Issue Date or thereafter entered into by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and payments and other benefits (including bonuses and retirement, severance, health, stock option, restricted share, stock appreciation right, phantom right, profit interest, equity incentive and other benefit plans) pursuant thereto; (2) (a) transactions between or among GFL and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries (or an entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) and (b) any merger or consolidation of GFL or any other direct or indirect parent of GFL; provided that such parent entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets (other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of GFL) and such merger or consolidation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide business purpose; (3) transactions in which GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to GFL or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (a) of the preceding paragraph; (4) payments, loans, advances or guarantees (or cancellation of loans, advances or guarantees) to employees, officers, directors, managers, consultants or independent contractors for bona fide business purposes or in the ordinary course of business; (5) the issuance or sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL or warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of GFL to, or the receipt by GFL of any capital contribution from, its shareholders or Affiliates; (6) Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments (except for Investments made in reliance on clauses (3), (5) and (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments); (7) any agreement or arrangement described in the Offering Memorandum and to which GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party as of or on the Issue Date, or as such agreement or arrangement is thereafter amended, supplemented or replaced (so long as such amendment, supplement or replacement agreement or arrangement is not materially disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by GFL or any direct or indirect parent of GFL) to the holders of the Notes when taken as a whole as compared to the original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date) or any transaction or payments contemplated thereby; ----- (8) transactions with customers, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services that are Affiliates of GFL, in each case in the ordinary course of business and which, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of GFL are on terms at least as favorable to GFL as would reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party; (9) transactions between GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person that is an Affiliate solely because one or more of its directors or officers is also a director or officer of GFL; provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of GFL on any such transaction involving such other Person; (10) any transaction with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in or otherwise controls such Person; provided that no Affiliate of GFL or any of its Subsidiaries (other than GFL or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall have a beneficial interest or otherwise participate in such Person; (11) a repurchase of Notes held by an Affiliate of GFL if repurchased on the same terms as have been offered to all Holders that are not Affiliates of GFL; (12) payments by GFL and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries made for any transaction or financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities (including in connection with financings, acquisitions or divestitures), which payments are approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors (or comparable governing body or managers) of GFL in good faith (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include payments to Affiliates of a Permitted Holder); (13) investments by Affiliates in Indebtedness or preferred Equity Interests of GFL or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as non-Affiliates were also offered the opportunity to invest in such Indebtedness or preferred Equity Interests, and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or preferred Equity Interests of GFL or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such transaction is with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders) and such Affiliates are treated no more favorably than all other holders of such class generally; (14) intercompany transactions undertaken in good faith for the purpose of improving the consolidated tax efficiency of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth in the Indenture; and (15) the entering into of any tax sharing agreement or arrangement that complies with clause (16)(viii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments” and the performance under any such agreement or arrangement. _Issuance of Note Guarantees_ After the Issue Date, GFL will cause each Material Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and that guarantees the obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to become a Guarantor, execute and deliver a Note Guarantee, and deliver an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Trustee, in each case within 90 days of the date on which such Material Restricted Subsidiary was acquired, created, qualified, designated or guaranteed the obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as applicable. Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary will be a Guarantor for all purposes of the Indenture, subject to the provisions described above under the caption “—Note Guarantees.” _Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_ The Board of Directors of GFL may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided that: (1) immediately after and giving effect to such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; ----- (2) at the time of the designation, GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries could make a Restricted Payment in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Subsidiary so designated in compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “—Restricted Payments”; (3) at the time of such designation, to the extent that any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary so designated is not Non-Recourse Debt, any guarantee or other credit support thereof by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries could be incurred at such time in compliance with the covenants set forth under the captions “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified _Stock” and “—Restricted Payments”;_ (4) such Subsidiary is not party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding with GFL or any Restricted Subsidiary unless any such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding would, immediately after giving effect to such designation, be permitted by the covenant set forth under the caption “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and (5) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither GFL nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect obligation (a) to subscribe for additional Equity Interests or (b) to maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or to cause such Person to achieve any specified levels of operating results unless such obligation could be performed by GFL in compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “—Restricted Payments” (and the maximum amount of such obligation shall be deemed to be an Investment by the Issuer for purposes of such covenant). Any designation of a Restricted Subsidiary of GFL as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of the resolutions of the Board of Directors of GFL giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified _Stock,” GFL will be in default of such covenant._ The Board of Directors of GFL may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that:_ (1) immediately after and giving effect to such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (2) such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock”; (3) the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Unrestricted Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and any such designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time in compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “—Restricted Payments”; (4) all Liens upon property and assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary existing at the time of such designation would be permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Liens”; and (5) such Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Issuance of Note Guarantees.” _Reports_ The Issuer will provide to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall deliver to the Holders, the following: (1) within 60 days after the end of each quarterly fiscal period in each fiscal year of GFL, other than the last quarterly fiscal period of each such fiscal year, copies of: ----- (a) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of GFL as at the end of such quarterly fiscal period and unaudited consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity of GFL for such quarterly fiscal period and, in the case of the second and third quarters, for the portion of the fiscal year ending with such quarter; and (b) an associated “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” included in the Offering Memorandum; and (2) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of GFL, copies of: (a) an audited consolidated balance sheet of GFL as at the end of such year and audited consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity of GFL for such fiscal year, together with a report of GFL’s auditors thereon; and (b) an associated “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” included in the Offering Memorandum; and (3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported (and in any event within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations), current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K Items 1.03, 2.01, 4.01, 5.01, 5.02(b) (with respect to GFL’s chief executive officer or chief financial officer only) and 5.02(c) (with respect to GFL’s chief executive officer or chief financial officer only) if GFL were required to file such reports; provided that (a) no such current report will be required to be provided if GFL determines in its good faith judgment that such event is not material to the business, assets, operations or prospects of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or if GFL determines in its good faith judgment that such disclosure would otherwise cause competitive harm to the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of GFL and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (in which event such nondisclosure shall be limited only to specific provisions that would cause material harm and not the occurrence of the event itself) and (b) in no event will any financial statements of an acquired business be required to be included in any such current report, in the case of each of the foregoing subclauses (1)(a) and (2)(a) prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reports referred to in the foregoing subclauses (1) and (2) are collectively referred to as the “Financial Reports.” GFL will, within 15 Business Days after providing to the Trustee any Financial Report, hold a conference call to discuss such Financial Report and the results of operations for the applicable reporting period. If GFL does not file reports with the SEC, then GFL will also maintain a website to which Holders, prospective investors and securities analysts are given access, on which not later than the date by which the Financial Reports are required to be provided to the Trustee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, GFL (i) makes available such Financial Reports and (ii) provides details about how to access on a toll-free basis the quarterly conference calls described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, (1) all Financial Reports will be deemed to have been provided to the Trustee and to the Holders to the extent filed (a) on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR+”) or any successor system thereto or (b) with the SEC via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) filing system or any successor system thereto, (2) the requirements of this covenant will be deemed satisfied by the posting of reports that would be required to be provided to the Holders on GFL’s website (or that of any of GFL’s parent companies), and (3) if GFL holds a quarterly conference call for its equity holders within 15 Business Days of filing a Financial Report on SEDAR+ or any successor system thereto, GFL will no longer be required to hold a separate conference call in respect of such Financial Report for the Holders as provided above. The Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring compliance with filings on SEDAR+ or EDGAR. In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding during any period when GFL is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act, or otherwise permitted to furnish the SEC with certain information ----- pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the 1934 Act, GFL will furnish to Holders of Notes and to prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the 1933 Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Issuer nor GFL will be deemed to have failed to comply with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default _and Remedies” until 120 days after the date any report hereunder is due. Events of Default and Remedies_ Each of the following is an Event of Default: (1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (2) default in the payment when due (at Stated Maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with any of the other obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) in the Indenture for 60 days after written notice has been given to the Issuer by the Trustee or to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes; (4) default under any other mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee existed on the Issue Date, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the applicable grace or cure period after final maturity provided in such Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”); or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default, which remains outstanding or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates an amount greater than $100.0 million; provided that if any such Payment Default is cured or waived or any such acceleration is rescinded, as the case may be, such Event of Default under the Indenture and any consequential acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded, so long as such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree; (5) failure by GFL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of an amount greater than $100.0 million in cash rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary by a court of competent jurisdiction, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgments becomes final and non-appealable; (6) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee of GFL or a Significant Subsidiary shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect, or GFL or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under its Note Guarantee; (7) GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to or within the meaning of any bankruptcy law: (a) commences a voluntary case or proceeding; (b) applies for or consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding; ----- (c) applies for or consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its assets; or (d) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any bankruptcy law that: (a) is for relief against GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries as debtor in an involuntary case or proceeding; (b) appoints a Custodian of GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or a Custodian for all or substantially all of the assets of GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or (c) orders the liquidation of GFL or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days and, in the case of the insolvency of a Significant Subsidiary, such Significant Subsidiary remains a Significant Subsidiary on such 60th day. In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (7) or (8) above, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare to be immediately due and payable, by notice in writing to the Issuer and (if given by the Holders) to the Trustee, the principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest to the date of acceleration; provided, however, that after any such declaration of acceleration, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may rescind and annul such declaration if: (a) all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of, interest and premium (if any) on the Notes that have become due solely by the declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived; and (b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest. Except to enforce payment of the principal of, and premium (if any) or interest on any Note on or after the Stated Maturity of such Note (after giving effect to the grace periods specified in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default and Remedies”), a Holder will not have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy thereunder, unless the Trustee: (1) shall have failed to act for a period of 60 days after receiving written notice of a continuing Event of Default from such Holder and a request to act from Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; (2) has been offered indemnity and funding thereof, if requested, satisfactory to the Trustee in its reasonable judgment; and (3) during such 60 day period, has not received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver promptly to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,135

If covenant defeasance occurs, certain Events of Default (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation, and insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.

In addition, for pro forma calculations with respect to any Sustainability Project, the following shall apply: (x) the pro forma adjustments referred to in immediately preceding sentence may be made commencing on the Commercial Operations Date for such Sustainability Project, (y) a commodity price index (determined in the good faith determination of GFL), acting reasonably, shall be used for the applicable commodity to which such Sustainability Project relates, it being agreed that for renewable natural gas the following are acceptable indices: “RIN” from the “Oil ----- Price Information Service” or “Brown Gas” from “Bloomberg”, and (z) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for all Sustainability Entities referred to in subsection (ii) of such definition included in any period pursuant to the Indenture shall not exceed an amount equal to 5.0% of the Consolidated EBITDA of GFL for the same period.

1047,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.22,Depositary Procedures,124.22.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of ----- transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",N/A,as_expected,2024,135

Under the terms of the Indenture, GFL and the trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither GFL, the Trustee nor any agent of GFL or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. ----- DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest) is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or GFL. Neither GFL nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Notes, and GFL and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, crossmarket transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised GFL that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time.
