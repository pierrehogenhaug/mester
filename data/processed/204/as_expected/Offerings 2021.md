**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the
European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or both)
of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU, (as amended, “MiFID II”) or
(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the purposes of**
each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as
defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “distributor”) should take
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

In the United Kingdom, the offering memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed only at, persons who (i)
are investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 43(2)
of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are high net worth entities or other persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to
(d) of the Financial Promotion Order, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”)
in connection with the issue or sale of any notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The offering memorandum is
directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which the offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and
will be engaged in only with relevant persons. No part of this offering memorandum should be published, reproduced,
distributed or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS – The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the
United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or both) of: (i) a retail client,

European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of

customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document

**Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has**
been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in
the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the purposes**
of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person

the senior secured credit facilities described herein), to the extent of the value of the assets securing that debt, rank senior in right of payment to all future subordinated

redeem all, but not less than all, of the notes at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax
law.

of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling

Securities legislation in certain of the Canadian provinces provides certain purchasers of securities pursuant
to an offering memorandum (such as this offering memorandum) with a remedy for damages or rescission, or both, in
addition to any other rights they may have at law, where the offering memorandum and any amendment thereto
contains a “misrepresentation,” as defined in the applicable securities legislation. A “misrepresentation” is generally
defined under applicable provincial securities laws to mean an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to
state a material fact that is required to be stated or that is necessary to make any statement not misleading in light of
the circumstances in which it was made. These remedies, or notice with respect to these remedies, must be exercised

and are subject to limitations and defences under applicable securities legislation.

The rights of action described above are in addition to and without derogation from any other right or remedy
available at law to the investor. Canadian investors should refer to the applicable provisions of the securities legislation
of their province of residence for the particulars of these rights and are advised to consult with their own legal advisers
prior to investing in the notes.

purposes of an investment in the notes. Canadian investors should consult with their own legal, financial and tax

the eligibility of the notes for investment by such investor under applicable Canadian federal and provincial legislation
and regulations.

**BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

In this offering memorandum, unless otherwise specified or the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,”
“our,” “us,” “company” and “Novelis” refer to Novelis Inc., a company formed in Canada under the Canada Business
Corporations Act, and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (including Novelis Sheet Ingot GmbH, a
limited liability company organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, the issuer of the notes) and,
for periods following the acquisition by the Company of Aleris Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Aleris
Acquisition”), such terms shall also refer to Aleris (as defined below). References to the “Issuer” refer exclusively to

to “total shipments” include aluminum rolled products as well as certain other non-rolled product shipments, primarily
scrap, used beverage cans (“UBC”), ingot, billets and primary remelt. The term “aluminum rolled products” is
synonymous with the terms “flat rolled products” and “FRP” commonly used by manufacturers and third party
analysts in our industry. References to “fiscal years” means, in the case of Novelis, a year or a twelve month period

-----

**NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We refer to the terms “EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Free Cash Flow” and “Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA” in various places in this offering memorandum and in documents we incorporate by reference herein. These
are supplemental financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP. Any analysis of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be
used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

_Novelis: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_

Novelis defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Novelis defines
Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before (a) “depreciation and amortization”; (b) “interest expense and amortization of
debt issuance costs”; (c) “interest income”; (d) “unrealized gains (losses) on change in fair value of derivative
instruments, net,” except for foreign currency remeasurement hedging activities, which are included in Adjusted
EBITDA; (e) impairment of goodwill; (f) “(gain) loss on extinguishment of debt”; (g) noncontrolling interest's share;
(h) adjustments to reconcile our proportional share of Adjusted EBITDA from non-consolidated affiliates to income
as determined on the equity method of accounting; (i) “restructuring and impairment, net”; (j) gains or losses on
disposals of property, plant and equipment and businesses, net; (k) other costs, net; (l) litigation settlement, net of
insurance recoveries; (m) sale transaction fees; (n) “income tax provision (benefit)”; (o) cumulative effect of
accounting change, net of tax; (p) metal price lag; (q) “business acquisition and other integration related costs”; (r)
purchase price accounting adjustments; (s) “income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (t) “loss on
sale of discontinued operations, net of tax.” EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures commonly used in our
industry, and we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance.
We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are operating performance measures that measure operating results
unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise
comparable companies.

Our management believes investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these nonU.S. GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Many investors
are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations
from one period to the next and would ordinarily add back items that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of
our business. By providing these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, together with reconciliations, we believe we are
enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in
evaluating how well we are executing strategic initiatives.

However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP,
and our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them
in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA:

    - do not reflect our cash expenditures or requirements for capital expenditures or capital commitments;

    - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and

    - do not reflect any costs related to the current or future replacement of assets being depreciated and
amortized.

We also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

    - as measures of operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a
consistent basis because it removes the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations;

    - for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budgets and financial
projections;

    - to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; and


-----

    - to calculate incentive compensation payments for our key employees.

_Free Cash Flow_

Novelis defines Free Cash Flow as: (a) “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities - continuing
operations,” (b) plus “Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations,” (c) plus “Net cash
provided by (used in) operating activities - discontinued operations,” (d) plus “Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities - discontinued operations,” (e) plus cash used in the “Acquisition of assets under a capital lease,” (f) plus
cash used in the “Acquisition of business, net of cash and restricted cash acquired,” (g) plus accrued merger
consideration, (h) less “Proceeds from sales of assets and business, net of transaction fees, cash income taxes and
hedging,” and (i) less “Proceeds from sales of assets and business, net of transaction fees, cash, income taxes and
hedging - discontinued operations.” Management believes Free Cash Flow is relevant to investors as it provides a
measure of the cash generated internally that is available for debt service and other value creation opportunities.
However, Free Cash Flow is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and does not
necessarily represent cash available for discretionary activities, as certain debt service obligations must be funded out
of Free Cash Flow. In addition, our method of calculating Free Cash Flow may not be consistent with that of other
companies.

_Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_

In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we
give pro forma effect to (i) the Aleris Acquisition, (ii) the borrowing of $1.1 billion of term loans (the “Short Term
Loans”) under the Short Term Credit Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2020 (the “Short Term Loan Credit
Agreement”) by Novelis Holdings Inc. on April 14, 2020, (iii) the borrowing of $775 million of incremental term
loans under our secured term loan credit agreement by Novelis Acquisitions LLC on April 14, 2020, (iv) the repayment
of all of the outstanding indebtedness of Aleris (other than the indebtedness of its Chinese subsidiaries), (v) the
payment of the fees and expenses relating to the Aleris Acquisition ((i) through (v), collectively, the “Aleris
Transactions”) and (vi) this offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds”
as if the Aleris Transactions and this offering had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period presented. Certain
of these pro forma effects are based on estimates and assumptions, all of which we believe have a reasonable basis,
although actual results could differ from those estimates and the assumed facts may not be realized. Please see footnote
(3) in “Offering Memorandum Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial
_Information of Novelis” included herein for a further discussion of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA._

_Aleris: Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA of Aleris is defined as net income and loss before interest income and expense, provision
for and benefit from income taxes, depreciation and amortization and income and loss from discontinued operations,
net of tax and excludes metal price lag, unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, restructuring
charges, currency exchange gains and losses on debt, stock-based compensation expense, start-up costs, loss on
extinguishment of debt, impairment of amounts held in escrow related to the sale of the recycling business and certain
other gains and losses.

Adjusted EBITDA of Aleris (“Aleris Adjusted EBITDA”) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies. Aleris Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by eliminating the impact of a number of items not
considered indicative of Aleris’ ongoing operating performance and certain other items. You are encouraged to
evaluate each adjustment and the reasons our management considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis.
However, Aleris Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measurement recognized under U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing
Aleris’ operating performance, investors should use Aleris Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative
for, net income and loss, operating income and loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, or in addition to, and not as an alternative for, cash flow from operating activities as a measure of Aleris’
liquidity.

Aleris Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation, or
as a substitute for, or superior to, Aleris’ measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
These limitations include:


-----

    - it does not reflect Aleris’ cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

    - it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;

    - it does not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal
payments under Aleris’ outstanding indebtedness;

    - it does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Aleris;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA,
does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and

    - other companies may calculate this measure differently and, as the number of differences in the way
companies calculate this measure increases, the degree of its usefulness as a comparative measure
correspondingly decreases.

Please see “Offering Memorandum Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
_Financial Information of Novelis” for a further discussion of our use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow_
and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum, including the reasons that we believe this information
is useful to our management and why it may be useful to investors, and a reconciliation of (i) our net income
attributable to our common shareholder, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, to our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most
directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our Free Cash Flow, (iii) our pro forma
net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and (iv) Aleris’ net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, to Aleris’ Adjusted EBITDA.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with
the SEC and public disclosures and press releases of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These rules require, among other things:

    - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures
calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and

    - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-U.S. GAAP
financial measure.

The rules prohibit, among other things:

    - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement
absent an ability to settle in another manner from non-U.S. GAAP liquidity measures;

    - adjustment of a non-U.S. GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as
nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably
likely to occur; and

    - presentation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures on the face of any pro forma financial information.

The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with these
rules.

**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that are based

expects our product mix to evolve to represent a relative increase in automotive, specialties and aerospace products,
and a reduction in can products, relative to fiscal 2020.

Based on current management expectations and estimates, we expect to make approximately $1.5 billion in
organic growth capital expenditures in our business over the next five years on processes, technologies and capabilities
to unlock increased capacity and to support our sustainability initiatives in line with our capital allocation framework.
We have invested approximately $700 million since 2011 to grow our total recycling capacity to approximately 2.5
million tonnes.

We operate in the global rolled aluminum products market, which had a global output of approximately 27
million tonnes in 2020 and which was forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% per
annum through 2025 (source: CRU Aluminum - November 2020). Novelis produced approximately 17% of the world
rolled aluminum supply in the year ended December 31, 2020 (source: CRU Aluminum - November 2020).

Our Parent’s registered office is located at 231 Church Street, Mississauga, Ontario L5M 1N1. Our principal
executive offices are located at 3560 Lenox Road, Suite 2000, Atlanta, Georgia 30326, and our telephone number is
(404) 760-4000. Our website is http://www.novelis.com. Information on our website does not constitute part of this
offering memorandum, and you should rely only on the information contained in this offering memorandum when
making a decision as to whether to invest in the notes described in this offering memorandum.

All of the common shares of Novelis Inc. are owned directly by AV Metals Inc. and indirectly by Hindalco
Industries Limited. Hindalco is one of Asia’s largest integrated producers of aluminum and a leading producer of
copper. Hindalco’s stock is publicly traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India
Limited and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Hindalco is an Indian corporation headquartered in Mumbai, India.
Hindalco is the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, a $48 billion multinational conglomerate with operations
in 36 countries.

**Aleris Acquisition**

On April 14, 2020, we closed our acquisition of Aleris, a global supplier of rolled aluminum products. Aleris’
product portfolio ranges from the most technically-demanding heat treated plate and sheet used in mission-critical
applications to sheet produced through its low-cost continuous cast process. Aleris possesses a combination of
technically-advanced, flexible and low-cost manufacturing operations supported by an industry-leading research and
development platform. Its facilities are strategically located to serve customers globally. Aleris’ diversified customer
base includes a number of industry-leading companies. We believe its technological and R&D capabilities allow it to
produce the most technically demanding products, many of which require close collaboration and, in some cases, joint
development with customers.

We expect the Aleris Acquisition to deliver a number of significant benefits by:

    - establishing a more diverse product portfolio, which will now include aerospace, beverage can,
automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation and specialty products;

    - integrating complementary assets in Asia to include recycling, casting, rolling and finishing capabilities
and allowing Novelis to more efficiently serve the growing Asia market; and

    - leveraging Novelis’ deep manufacturing and recycling expertise to optimize Aleris’ assets and unlock
valuable synergies.

Aleris had revenues of $3,376 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $388 million and shipments of 858 kt for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the antitrust review processes in the European Union, the United
States and China required for approval of the acquisition, we were obligated to divest Aleris' European and North
American automotive assets, including its plants in Duffel, Belgium (“Duffel”) and Lewisport, Kentucky
(“Lewisport”).

On September 30, 2020, we completed the sale of Duffel to Liberty House Group through its subsidiary,
ALVANCE, the international aluminum business of the GFG Alliance. Previously, the European Commission and


-----

Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation determined that our acquisition of Aleris could proceed on the
condition that we divest Duffel to a third party that met certain buyer suitability requirements. Both regulators
approved ALVANCE as a suitable buyer. In November 2019, ALVANCE agreed to acquire Duffel for €310 million.
At closing on September 30, 2020, we received €210 million in cash ($246 million as of September 30, 2020). The
parties have agreed to a post-closing arbitration process regarding the payment of the remaining €100 million. There
is no assurance as to when we expect the post-closing arbitration process to conclude and whether we will receive any
of the remaining €100 million payment.

On September 4, 2019, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed an action to block our
acquisition of Aleris and contemporaneously announced an agreement with us to resolve the antitrust issues through
binding arbitration. On March 9, 2020, the arbitrator assigned to resolve the dispute ruled in favor of the DOJ. As a
consequence of that ruling, we were required to divest Lewisport. On August 21, 2020, the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Ohio appointed a divestiture trustee to oversee the sale of the Lewisport plant and
make a recommendation to the DOJ regarding a buyer. On November 6, 2020, the DOJ notified us that American
Industrial Partners (“AIP”) was approved as the acquirer of Lewisport. On November 8, 2020, we entered into a
definitive agreement with AIP for the sale of Lewisport. For a discussion of important factors that may impact the
integration of Aleris into our operations, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Competitive and Strategic Risks—The
_integration of Aleris into our operations will require significant management attention and may not produce the_
_benefits we anticipate” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, which is_
incorporated herein by reference. The sale of Lewisport was completed on November 30, 2020 for net cash proceeds
of $180 million. In addition, we have recorded a $17 million receivable for net working capital adjustments. See “Part
_I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Competitive and Strategic Risks—In connection with our acquisition of Aleris, we are_
_required to undertake asset divestitures that may reduce the value of the acquisition” in our Annual Report on Form_
10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference.

**COVID-19**

Beginning late in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and carrying into the current
fiscal year, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its unprecedented negative economic implications, have affected production
and sales across a range of industries around the world.

Our global operations, similar to those of many other large, multi-national corporations, were also impacted.
Early in fiscal year 2021, we were required to partially shut down or temporarily close certain facilities in the United
States and abroad to comply with state orders and governmental decrees and adjust schedules at some of our facilities
based on customer demand. The plant shut downs and adjusted schedules resulting from COVID-19 resulted in
disruptions to our supply chain, interruptions to our production, and delays of shipments to our customers, mainly
during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.

While much of our customer demand and shipments recovered in the majority of our end markets during the
second fiscal quarter and remained robust in the third fiscal quarter, the overall extent of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and financial condition will depend on certain developments,
including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our customers, employees, and vendors. We believe
this will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and
global economies and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state, and local governmental responses. As of
December 31, 2020, we had available liquidity of $2,390 million, which consisted of $1,164 million in cash and cash
equivalents and $1,226 million in remaining availability under committed credit facilities. For a further discussion of
the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our operational and financial performance, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic—Our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers and_
_customers, may be adversely affected by public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.”_

Our application of U.S. GAAP requires the pervasive use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference. The global
COVID-19 pandemic has required greater use of estimates and assumptions. More specifically, those estimates and
assumptions that are utilized in our forecasted cash flows form the basis in developing the fair values utilized in
impairment assessments as well as annual effective tax rate. This has included assumptions as to the duration and
severity of the pandemic, timing and amount of demand shifts amongst sales channels (primarily in the automotive
industry), workforce availability, and supply chain continuity. We have experienced short-term disruptions and


-----

anticipate that such disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future, but we also anticipate an eventual return to
normal demand. Although we have made our best estimates based upon current information, the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on our business may result in future changes to our estimates and assumptions based on its duration.
Actual results could materially differ from the estimates and assumptions developed by management. If so, we may
be subject to future impairment charges as well as changes to recorded reserves and valuations.

**Recent Developments**

On March 11, 2021, the Parent obtained commitments to borrow $500 million of term loans (the “2021 Term
Loans”) under the Term Loan Facility, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent. The Parent expects
to borrow the 2021 Term Loans on or about March 31, 2021. The 2021 Term Loans will mature on or about March
31, 2028 and will be subject to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments. The 2021 Term Loans will accrue interest at
LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. The proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan will be applied to refinance $500 million of the
2017 Term Loans. Immediately after giving effect to such refinancing, $633 million of 2017 Term Loans, $769 million
of 2020 Term Loans and $500 million of 2021 Term Loans will be outstanding. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit Facilities”._

On March 16, 2021, we repaid in full the amounts outstanding in respect of the short term loans (the “Short
Term Loans”) that were funded on the closing date of the Aleris Acquisition. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Short Term Loans”._

(A) Unrealized (losses) gain on the derivative instruments not included in Adjusted EBITDA represent the mark-to-market accounting for
changes in the fair value of our derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment.

(B) Under U.S. GAAP, entities in which we have 20% to 50% ownership are generally accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. However, our Adjusted EBITDA for each of our business segments includes the results of these non-consolidated affiliates
on a proportionally consolidated basis, which is consistent with how we manage our business. Accordingly, in calculating Adjusted
EBITDA, we add back the results of our non-consolidated affiliates on a proportionally consolidated basis, net of our share of their
net after-tax results, which are already included in our operating results.

(C) See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference herein.

A. The historical financial information of Novelis relating to the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Novelis is derived from our
audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, plus our unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended
December 31, 2020, less our unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2019.

B. The historical financial information relating to the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Aleris is based on estimated management
accounts of Aleris prior to our ownership (for the three-month period January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020), which have not been
audited or reviewed by auditors and no procedures have been compiled or performed with respect to such financial information. In
addition, our auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to such financial information and,
accordingly, do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The amounts attributable to Aleris included
in our presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA herein have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation
S-X or any other securities laws relating to the presentation of pro forma financial information, are presented for illustrative purposes
only, do not purport to be indicative of the contribution that Aleris would have made to our Adjusted EBITDA had such businesses been
included in our operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and do not purport to project our future operating results. In
addition, the financial information for Aleris for the period from April 1, 2020 through April 14, 2020 (which is the date we acquired
Aleris) is not included in any financial information presented or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—This offering memorandum includes pro forma financial information for the_
_twelve months ended December 31, 2020 that was not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC relating to the_
_use of pro forma financial statements. Also, we have not included certain historical financial information of Aleris in this offering_
_memorandum.”_

C. Certain adjustments were made to factor in the effects of the Aleris Transactions on the statement of operations and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA. These adjustments include the following:

a. The elimination of Aleris’ historical depreciation and amortization expense, and the recognition of new depreciation and
amortization expense;
b. An adjustment to interest expense for the removal of historical interest expense and the addition of interest expense related
to debt issued as part of the Aleris Transactions, as well as this offering and the application of the use of proceeds therefrom;
c. The reverse of non-recurring transaction costs recorded in the historical Novelis and Aleris statements of operations; and
d. The related tax impacts of the above adjustments.

D. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA gives effect to the Aleris Transactions and this offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom as
described in “Use of Proceeds” as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2020.

(4) Representing the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. The Short Term Loans were repaid in full on March 16, 2021.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information_
_contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, including the risk factors listed below, those_
_described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,_
_2020 and in other documents that we have filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in this offering_
_memorandum. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also_
_materially adversely affect us. If any of such risks actually occur, you may lose all or part of your investment. The_
_risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from_
_those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic**

**_Our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers and customers, may be adversely affected by_**
**_public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic._**

We face risks related to public health crises, including outbreaks of communicable diseases. The outbreak of
such a communicable disease could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial
activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus
(“COVID-19”) spread across the globe to many countries in which we do business and impacted worldwide economic
activity.

A public health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, poses the risk that we or our employees,
contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities
for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that have been requested and mandated by governmental
authorities, or that such crisis may otherwise interrupt or impair business activities.

Additionally, as a result of the Aleris Acquisition, we expect to derive future revenues from customers in the
aerospace end-use market. Due to severe impacts from the global COVID-19 pandemic, demand for air travel declined
dramatically in 2020, resulting in airline capacity reductions. Consequently, we have experienced a significant decline
in orders from aerospace customers, which has negatively impacted our business.

While it is not possible to predict the impact that a global health crisis could have on our operations and those
of our suppliers and customers, the measures taken by the governments of countries affected, actions taken to protect
employees, and the impact of any such crisis on various business activities in affected countries could adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering**

**_Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business and therefore make it more difficult for us to fulfill_**
**_our obligations under the notes._**

As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the application of the
net proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds,” we would have had $11,260 million of indebtedness and
other liabilities outstanding.

Our substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences to our company and
holders of the notes, including:

    - limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures or other
general corporate purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including volatility in
London Metal Exchange prices;

    - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including
borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;


-----

    - limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and
adverse changes in government regulation; and

    - limiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness.

**_Despite the level of our indebtedness, we may still incur significantly more indebtedness. This could further_**
**_increase the risks associated with our indebtedness._**

Despite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional
indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in the future. Although the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures
governing notes currently outstanding and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby contain restrictions
on the Parent’s and its subsidiaries’ (including the Issuer’s) ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the indebtedness incurred
in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the
related risks that we face would be increased and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations, including
repayment of the notes, in whole or in part.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be_**
**_forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial
condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to
certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain such a level of cash
flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our
indebtedness, including the notes, and any such failure to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest on our
indebtedness may have a further negative impact on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced
to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or
refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the
condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our
business operations. The terms of our existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that will govern the notes
offered hereby may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of
interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be
successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.

**_The covenants in the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing notes currently outstanding and the_**
**_indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us._**

The senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing notes currently outstanding and the indenture
that will govern the notes offered hereby impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These
restrictions limit the ability of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries (including the Issuer), among other things, to:

     - incur additional debt and provide additional guarantees;

     - pay dividends and make other restricted payments, including certain investments;

     - create or permit certain liens;

     - make certain asset sales;

     - use the proceeds from the sales of assets and subsidiary stock;

     - create or permit restrictions on the ability of the Parent’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or
make other inter-company distributions to the Parent or any other of its restricted subsidiaries, as
applicable;


-----

     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

     - designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

     - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all assets.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the senior secured
credit facilities or the indentures governing our notes currently outstanding, that is not waived by the required lenders
or holders of such indebtedness, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from
paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes currently outstanding and the notes offered hereby and
could substantially decrease the market value of such notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are
otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on
our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating
covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the covenants contained in the senior secured
credit facilities, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event
of such default:

     - the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments
thereunder, declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable and, if not promptly paid,
institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets;

     - even if those lenders do not declare a default, they may be able to cause all of our available cash to be
used to repay their loans; and

     - such default could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration under our other indebtedness.

As a result of such default and any actions the lenders may take in response thereto, we could be forced into
bankruptcy or liquidation.

If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders
under the senior secured credit facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under the senior secured
credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we
could be in default under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above,
and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_Although the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing notes currently outstanding and the_**
**_indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments,_**
**_there are a number of exceptions to these restrictions._**

Although the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing notes currently outstanding and the
indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments,
there are a number of exceptions to these restrictions and, following this offering, we will be permitted to make a
substantial amount of restricted payments. In such case, there will be less available cash to service our indebtedness,
which will increase the risk that we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations, including payments of principal
and interest on the notes.

**_The Parent is primarily a holding company and is dependent on its subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to_**
**_meet its debt service obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our obligations under the_**
**_Parent Guaranty (as defined below under “Description of the Notes”)._**

The Parent is primarily a holding company and a large portion of its assets is the capital stock of its
subsidiaries and the equity interests in its joint ventures. As a holding company, the Parent conducts substantially all
of its business through its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Consequently, cash flow and the ability to service debt
obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our obligations under the Parent Guaranty, are
dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and joint ventures and the distribution of those earnings, or upon loans,
advances or other payments made by these entities to the Parent or any restricted subsidiary. The ability of these


-----

entities to pay dividends or make other loans, advances or payments to the Parent or any restricted subsidiaries will
depend upon their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in the
instruments governing their debt, and the Parent may not exercise sufficient control to cause distributions to be made
to the Parent. Although the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing the notes currently outstanding
and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby each limit the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to enter
into consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Parent or any of its
restricted subsidiaries, these limitations do not apply to the Parent, its existing joint ventures or unrestricted
subsidiaries and the limitations are also subject to important exceptions and qualifications.

The ability of the Parent’s restricted subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us
to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our
obligations under the Parent Guaranty, will depend on their future financial performance, which will be affected by a
range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. We cannot assure you
that the cash flow and earnings of our operating subsidiaries and the amount that they are able to distribute to us as
dividends or otherwise will be adequate for us to service our debt obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under
the notes and our obligations under the Parent Guaranty. If the subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow from
operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our obligations under
the Parent Guaranty, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our
debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure
you that any such alternative refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of
the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on
acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt
instruments then in effect. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance
our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow, as well as on our ability to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our
obligations under the Parent Guaranty.

**_Your right to receive payment on the notes is effectively junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured_**
**_indebtedness of the Issuer or the guarantors, including the Parent, up to the value of the collateral securing such_**
**_indebtedness._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes are unsecured. The notes will be effectively junior to all existing and
future secured indebtedness of the Issuer or the guarantors up to the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.
For example, as of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the application of
the net proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds,” the notes and the related guarantees would have
effectively ranked junior to our $2,041 million of secured debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities,
which is secured by the Parent’s assets and the assets of its principal subsidiaries, including the Issuer.

Although the indenture that will govern the notes contains restrictions on the Parent’s ability and the ability
of its restricted subsidiaries to create or incur liens to secure indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to important
limitations and exceptions that permit us to secure a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. Accordingly, in
the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization affecting the Issuer or any guarantor, your rights to receive
payment will be effectively subordinated to those of secured creditors up to the value of the collateral securing such
indebtedness. Holders of the notes will participate ratably with all holders of unsecured indebtedness that is deemed
to be of the same class as the notes, including the notes currently outstanding and potentially with all other general
creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in our remaining assets. In any of the
foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result,
holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness. In addition, if the secured lenders
were to declare a default with respect to their loans and enforce their rights with respect to their collateral, there can
be no assurance that our remaining assets would be sufficient to satisfy our other obligations, including our obligations
with respect to the notes and our obligations under the Parent Guaranty.

**_Your right to receive payment on the notes could be adversely affected if any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries_**
**_declares bankruptcy, liquidates or reorganizes._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will be guarantors of the notes. As a result, you will be creditors of only
the Issuer, the Parent and the subsidiaries that guarantee the notes. In the case of subsidiaries that are not guarantors,


-----

all the existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, debtholders and
preferred shareholders, will be structurally senior to the notes and related guarantees. Subject to limitations in the
senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing our notes currently outstanding and the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby, non-guarantor subsidiaries may incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness
in the future (and may incur other liabilities without limitation). In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, their creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their
claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. On a pro forma
basis, after giving effect to the Aleris Transactions, our subsidiaries that will not be guarantors would have had net
sales of $2,962 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and would have had assets of $3,029 million
and, after giving further effect to this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in “Use
_of Proceeds,” debt and other liabilities of $1,743 million (including inter-company balances) as of December 31, 2020._

**_The Issuer may be unable to repurchase the notes upon a change of control triggering event._**

Upon the occurrence of a specified change of control triggering event, the Issuer will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding notes being offered hereby at a price of 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The indentures governing our currently outstanding
notes contain similar provisions. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control Offer.” The source of funds for
any such purchase of the notes will be our available cash or cash generated from operations or other sources, including
borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of
control triggering event because we may not have sufficient financial resources to repurchase all such notes that are
tendered upon a change of control triggering event. Accordingly, the Issuer may not be able to satisfy its obligations
to repurchase the notes unless the Issuer is able to refinance or obtain waivers under the senior secured credit facilities.
The Issuer’s failure to repurchase the notes upon a change of control triggering event would cause a default under the
indenture that will govern the notes and a cross default under the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures
governing the currently outstanding notes.

Also, the Issuer cannot assure you that a repurchase of the notes following such a change of control triggering
event would be permitted pursuant to any of our indebtedness agreements that would be in effect at the time of such
change of control triggering event, which could cause our other indebtedness to be accelerated. The senior secured
credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute a default that permits lenders to accelerate the
maturity of borrowings thereunder. If we cannot obtain a waiver of such default or seek to refinance such indebtedness,
this could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any future indebtedness agreement may contain similar
provisions. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, the Issuer may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the
notes and repay such indebtedness.

In addition, the change of control provision and other covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes
offered hereby do not cover all corporate reorganizations, mergers, amalgamations or similar transactions and may
not provide you with protection in a transaction, including a highly leveraged transaction, unless such transaction
constitutes a change of control triggering event under the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_Some of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will be suspended during any future period that_**
**_we have an investment grade rating from one rating agency (or both agencies) with respect the notes and we are_**
**_not in default under the indenture, and during any such period you will not have the benefit of those covenants as_**
**_holders of the notes._**

Some of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes, as well as our obligation to offer to
repurchase the notes following certain asset sales or upon a change of control, will be suspended if the notes obtain
an investment grade rating from either (or both) of Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s and we are not in default under the
indenture. If such a suspension occurs, the protections afforded to you by the covenants that have been suspended will
not be restored until the investment grade rating assigned by either (or both) of Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, as the
case may be, to the notes should subsequently decline and as a result the notes do not carry an investment grade rating
from at least one rating agency. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Suspension.”


-----

**_The notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore holders of the notes must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry
interests will not be considered owners or holders of notes. The common depository (or its nominee) for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, as Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will
be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the notes and
credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the
owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if holders own a book-entry interest in the notes, they must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if they are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the
procedures of the participant through which they own an interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of
the notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to
act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if
holders of the notes own a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only to the extent they have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no
assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable holders of the notes
to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the definitive
registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if a holder owns a book-entry interest, it will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. There can be no assurance that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
notes.

**_There is no public market for the notes and we do not know if a market will ever develop or, if a market does_**
**_develop, whether it will be sustained._**

The notes are a new issue of securities and there is no existing trading market for the notes. Although we
intend to use all reasonable efforts to have the notes admitted to listing and trading on the Exchange (or another
recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers), there is no assurance that the notes will be listed and admitted to
trade on the Exchange. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the notes,
they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue making a market at any time without notice. In addition, any
market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. As a result,
we cannot assure you that a liquid market will develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a
particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell the notes will be favorable. If a liquid market is
established, various factors could have a material adverse effect on the trading of the notes, including fluctuations in
prevailing interest rates. We do not intend to apply for listing or quotation of the notes on any securities exchange or
stock market.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to substantial volatility. We cannot
assure you that the market for the notes will be free from similar volatility. Any such disruptions could have an adverse
effect on holders of the notes.

**_Hindalco and its interests as equity holder may conflict with the interests of the holders of senior notes in the future._**

Novelis is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Hindalco. As a result, Hindalco may exercise control
over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction or capital restructuring and has the ability to approve or
prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our shareholder. Hindalco may have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investment,
even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of the notes.


-----

Additionally, Hindalco operates in the aluminum industry and may from time to time acquire and hold
interests in businesses that compete, directly or indirectly, with us. Hindalco has no obligation to provide us with
financing and is able to sell their equity ownership in us at any time.

**_You may transfer the notes only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of_**
**_the Securities Act._**

We are relying upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws to offer the notes. In addition, we will not be obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the
resale of the notes or to offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act. As a result, for so
long as the notes remain outstanding, they may be transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the
registration requirements of federal and applicable state securities laws. The indenture that will govern the notes
offered hereby will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and you will only be entitled
to receive the information about the Issuer and the guarantors specified under “Description of the Notes—Reports and
_Other Information,” including the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act._

**_Changes in our credit ratings, the financial and credit markets or other factors could adversely affect the market_**
**_prices of the notes._**

The future market prices of the notes will be affected by a number of factors, including:

    - our ratings with major credit rating agencies;

    - the number of holders of notes;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the prevailing interest rates being paid by companies similar to us; and

    - the overall condition of the financial and credit markets and our operating performance, financial
condition or prospects.

The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the recent
past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the trading prices of
the notes. In addition, credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies that they follow, including
us. We cannot assure you that credit rating agencies will continue to rate the notes or that they will maintain their
ratings on the notes. The withdrawal of a rating or a negative change in our rating could have an adverse effect on the
market prices of the notes.

**_Your purchase of the notes may raise certain ERISA considerations._**

If you make the decision to invest in the notes on behalf of an employee benefit plan which is subject to
ERISA (as defined below), or on behalf of any other entity the underlying assets of which are “plan assets” under
ERISA (individually a “Plan” and collectively “Plans”) or a plan which is subject to laws which have a similar purpose
or effect to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA (“Similar Laws”), you shall
be deemed, on behalf of such Plan or plan, by purchasing and holding the notes, or exercising any rights related to the
notes, to represent that (i) the Plan or plan will receive no less and pay no more than adequate consideration in
connection with the purchase and holding of the notes, (ii) none of the purchase, holding or disposition of the notes or
the exercise of any rights related to the notes will result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under the U.S.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”), or a non-exempt violation of any Similar Laws, (iii) neither we nor any of our affiliates is
a sponsor of, or a “fiduciary” (within the meaning of ERISA or any Similar Laws) with respect to, the Plan or plan or
any transferee and (iv) no advice provided by us or any of our affiliates has formed a primary basis for making any
investment or other decision for or on behalf of such Plan or plan in connection with the notes or the exercise of any
rights with respect to the notes. A breach of any such deemed representation might result in a prohibited transaction
under ERISA or the Code.

**_Fraudulent conveyance laws and other legal doctrines may permit courts to void or subordinate the notes or the_**
**_guarantees of the notes in specific circumstances, which would prevent or limit payment under the notes or the_**
**_guarantees. Certain limitations contained in the guarantees, which are designed to avoid this result, may render_**
**_the guarantees worthless._**

The notes will be guaranteed by the Parent and a number of the Parent’s subsidiaries. We note that, generally,
with respect to guarantees of the obligations of an issuer, whether direct or indirect, applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
and financial assistance laws of the relevant jurisdictions may limit the remedies of noteholders against guarantors.
Federal, state and foreign statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void or subordinate the notes or
any or all of the subsidiaries’ guarantees of the notes. If the notes or any guarantees are voided or subordinated, our
noteholders might be required to return payments received from the Issuer, the Parent or the subsidiaries. The criteria
for application of such fraudulent conveyance and other statutes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but, in general,
under United States federal bankruptcy law, comparable provisions of state fraudulent conveyance laws, the notes or
a guarantee could be set aside or subordinated if, among other things, the Issuer or the guarantor, as applicable, at the
time the notes were issued or the guarantor provided the guarantee:

    - incurred debt represented by the notes or the guarantee with the intent of hindering, defeating, delaying
or defrauding current or future creditors or of giving one creditor a preference over others; or

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for incurring the notes or the
guarantee, and

    - was insolvent, on the eve of insolvency, or was rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of the
notes or the guarantee;

    - was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which the assets remaining with it
constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on such business;

    - conducted itself in a manner that was oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly disregarded
the interests of creditors and certain other interested parties;

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured;
or

    - was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages entered against
it, if, in either case, after final judgment the judgment was unsatisfied.

Under Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws and comparable provincial laws on preferences,
fraudulent conveyances, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transactions, the payment of money,
disposition of property, incurrence of an obligation, or provision of services to a creditor or other person can be
challenged as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable
transaction. The tests to be applied under these Canadian laws vary, but as a general matter, these challenges may arise
in circumstances where:

    - an entity is found to be insolvent at the time it issued a note or provided a guarantee;

    - an entity was rendered insolvent by issuing a note or providing a guarantee;

    - a note was issued, or a guarantee was provided, within a specified period of time prior to the
commencement of proceedings under Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring
legislation and the consideration received by the insolvent note issuer or guarantor was conspicuously
less than the fair market value of the consideration given by the note issuer or guarantor;

    - an insolvent note issuer or guarantor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor or such action was
taken with a view to giving such a creditor a preference;


-----

    - holders of notes, or beneficiaries under guarantees, were not dealing at arm’s length with an insolvent
issuer or guarantor and the obligation incurred had the effect of giving such holders of notes, or
beneficiaries under guarantees, a preference; or

    - a note issuer or a guarantor is found to have acted in a manner that was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial
to, or unfairly disregarded the interests of, any shareholder, creditor, director, officer or other interested
party.

Although varying by jurisdiction, generally, a court might find that the issuer of the notes did not receive
reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes and did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly
from the issuance of the notes to the extent that the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used to make a
distribution to the issuer’s shareholders. In addition, a court might find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly
or indirectly from the issuance of its guarantee. As a general matter, value is given for an obligation if, in exchange
for the obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied.

The definition and test for insolvency will vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being
applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

    - the sum of its debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, was greater than its assets at fair
valuation;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay the probable liability
on its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became absolute and
matured; or

    - it could not pay or has ceased paying its debts generally as they become due. In general, a Canadian
court would deem an entity insolvent if:

    - it is for any reason unable to meets its obligations as they generally become due;

    - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become
due; or

    - the aggregate of its property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted
sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all of its obligations, due and
accruing due.

The tests for preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable
transaction, including the criteria for insolvency, will vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being
applied. We cannot be sure which tests and standards a court would apply to determine whether or not the Issuer or
the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the tests and standards, whether the issuance of the
notes or the guarantee would be voided or subordinated to our or the guarantor’s other debt.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or incurrence of the guarantee was a preference, fraudulent
conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction or should be set aside on other
grounds, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the
notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the issuer or the related guarantor, as the case
may be, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee.

Also, a Canadian court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or guarantees to other claims
against the issuer and/or guarantors if the court determines that:

    - the holder of notes or beneficiary of the guarantee engaged in some form of inequitable conduct;

    - the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon
the holders of the notes or beneficiaries of the guarantees; and


-----

    - such subordination is not inconsistent with applicable laws.

A court may also impose substantive consolidation, or variants thereof, on insolvent debtor company estates
(provided certain criteria are met), and this may impair your ability to collect payment in full under the notes and the
guarantees.

Each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount
that it could incur without causing its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. However, this provision may automatically
reduce the guarantor’s obligations to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless and, in any case, this
provision may not be effective to protect a guarantee from being avoided under fraudulent transfer laws. For example,
in a Florida bankruptcy case, a similar provision was found to be ineffective to protect similar guarantees.

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)
or custodian (Sachwalter) may challenge (anfechten) transactions (Rechtsgeschäft) or acts (Rechtshandlungen) that
are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable avoidance periods.

**_Because each subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero, avoided or released_**
**_under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the subsidiary guarantors._**

You have the benefit of the guarantees of the Parent and the subsidiary guarantors. However, the guarantees
by the subsidiary guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the subsidiary guarantors are permitted to
guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to
zero, depending upon the amount of other obligations of such subsidiary guarantor. Further, under the circumstances
discussed more fully above, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes and applicable
Canadian federal or provincial law could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other
obligations of the subsidiary guarantor. In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released
under certain circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Parent Guaranty” and “Description of the
_Notes—Subsidiary Guaranties.”_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the notes or under the guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany and the guarantors are incorporated under the laws of
the United States, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the United
Kingdom. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in
any or all of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the notes and the guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of
multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency
and other similar proceedings. Multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and
often result in substantial uncertainty and substantial delays in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, and other laws of the respective guarantors’
jurisdictions of incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another and those of Canada
and the United States, including creditors’ rights and remedies, priority of creditors, priority claims, the ability to
obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in
multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could have a material
adverse effect or result in substantial uncertainty or substantial delays on your ability to enforce your rights and to
collect payment in full under the notes and the guarantees.

**_Holders of the notes may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer is organized outside the United States, and a substantial portion of our business is conducted
outside the United States. We expect the directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer to be non-residents
of the United States, and all or substantially all of their assets will be located outside the United States. Although we
will submit to the jurisdiction of certain U.S. federal and New York state courts in connection with any action under
U.S. securities laws, holders of the notes may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these
directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and those of their


-----

directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, holders of the notes may be unable to enforce
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.

Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty
providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and
commercial matters with Germany. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of U.S. securities
laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany of any
judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject
to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Germany would have the requisite power or authority to grant
remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations.

**_There can be no assurance that use of proceeds of the notes to finance Eligible Green Projects will be suitable for_**
**_the investment criteria of an investor._**

It is the Issuer’s intention to apply an amount equal to the proceeds from the offer of the notes specifically
for Eligible Green Projects (as defined under “Use of Proceeds” below). Prospective investors should have regard to
the information set out in this offering memorandum regarding such use of proceeds and must determine for
themselves the relevance of such information for the purpose of any investment in the notes together with any other
investigation such investor deems necessary. In particular no assurance is given by the Issuer, Sustainalytics or any
initial purchaser that the use of such proceeds for any Eligible Green Projects will satisfy, whether in whole or in part,
any present or future investor expectations or requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which
such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations
or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with regard to any direct
or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any projects or uses, the subject of or related to, any
Eligible Green Projects.

Furthermore, it should be noted that there is currently no clearly defined definition (legal, regulatory or
otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, a “green”, “social”, “sustainable” or an equivalently
labelled project or as to what precise attributes are required for a particular project to be defined as “green”, “social”,
“sustainable” or such other equivalent label nor can any assurance be given that such a clear definition or consensus
will develop over time. Accordingly, no assurance is or can be given to investors that any projects or uses the subject
of, or related to, any Eligible Green Projects will meet any or all investor expectations regarding such “green”, “social”,
“sustainable” or other equivalently-labelled performance objectives or that any adverse environmental, social and/or
other impacts will not occur during the implementation of any projects or uses the subject of, or related to, any Eligible
Green Projects.

No assurance or representation is given as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of any
opinion or certification of any third party (whether or not solicited by the Issuer) which will be made available in
connection with the issue of the notes and in particular with any Eligible Green Projects to fulfil any environmental,
social, sustainability and/or other criteria. For the avoidance of doubt, any such opinion or certification is not, nor
shall be deemed to be, incorporated in and/or form part of this offering memorandum.

Any such opinion or certification is not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuer or any
initial purchaser, or any other person to buy, sell or hold any notes. Any such opinion or certification is only current
as of the date that opinion was initially issued. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the relevance of
any such opinion or certification and/or the information contained therein and/or the provider of such opinion or
certification for the purpose of any investment in such notes. Currently, the providers of such opinions and
certifications are not subject to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight.

In the event that the notes are listed or admitted to trading on any dedicated “green”, “environmental”,
“social”, “sustainable” or other equivalently-labelled segment of any stock exchange or securities market (whether or
not regulated), no representation or assurance is given by the Issuer or any initial purchaser or any other person that
such listing or admission satisfies, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or
requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required
to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing
rules or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, social or


-----

sustainability impact of any projects or uses, the subject of or related to, any Eligible Green Projects. Furthermore, it
should be noted that the criteria for any such listings or admission to trading may vary from one stock exchange or
securities market to another. Nor is any representation or assurance given or made by the Issuer or any initial purchaser
or any other person that any such listing or admission to trading will be obtained in respect of any such notes or, if
obtained, that any such listing or admission to trading will be maintained during the life of the notes.

While it is the intention of the Issuer to apply an amount equivalent to the proceeds of the notes for Eligible
Green Projects in, or substantially in, the manner described under “Use of Proceeds”, there can be no assurance that
the relevant project(s) or use(s) the subject of, or related to, any Eligible Green Projects will be capable of being
implemented in or substantially in such manner and/or accordance with any timing schedule and that accordingly such
proceeds will be totally or partially disbursed for such Eligible Green Projects. Nor can there be any assurance that
such Eligible Green Projects will be completed within any specified period or at all or with the results or outcome
(whether or not related to the environment) as originally expected or anticipated by the Issuer. Any such event or
failure by the Issuer will not constitute an Event of Default under the notes.

Any such event or failure to apply the proceeds of the issue of notes for any Eligible Green Projects as
aforesaid and/or withdrawal of any such opinion or certification or any such opinion or certification attesting that the
Issuer is not complying in whole or in part with any matters for which such opinion or certification is opining or
certifying on and/or any notes no longer being listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange or securities market
as aforesaid may have a material adverse effect on the value of the notes and/or result in adverse consequences for
certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in securities to be used for a particular purpose.

**_Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to_**
**_Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings._**

Although we plan to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible Green Projects
and also plan to undertake certain reporting and other obligations as described under “Use of proceeds,” the indenture
will not include covenants or agreements requiring us to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering
to Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy the reporting and other undertakings described under “Use of proceeds.” As a
result, it will not be an event of default under the indenture if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds
from this offering to Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy such reporting and other undertakings, and holders of the
notes will have no remedies under the indenture for any such failure.

**_The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information incorporated by reference into this offering_**
**_memorandum is based on a number of preliminary estimates and assumptions and our actual results of operations,_**
**_cash flows and financial position for periods after the Aleris Acquisition may differ materially._**

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our actual
results of operations, cash flows and financial position would have been had the Aleris Acquisition been completed
on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects adjustments,
which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the Aleris identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
at fair value, and the resulting goodwill recognized. The assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma
financial data may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may adversely affect our actual results of operations,
cash flows and financial position.

**_This offering memorandum includes pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended December 31,_**
**_2020 that was not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC relating to the use of pro forma_**
**_financial statements. Also, we have not included certain historical financial information of Aleris in this offering_**
**_memorandum._**

In this offering memorandum we present pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020, including Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. These figures give pro forma effect to the Aleris
Transactions and this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds.”
The historical financial information attributable to Aleris prior to our ownership was derived from a combination of
audited and unaudited financial information of Aleris and estimated management accounts of Aleris. In particular, the
financial information of Aleris represents the financial information from Aleris’ audited financial statements for the


-----

year ended December 31, 2019, less financial information from Aleris’ unaudited financial statements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019, plus financial information from estimated management accounts of Aleris for the
three-month period from January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020. The financial information of Aleris for the threemonth period January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020 is based on estimated management accounts of Aleris prior to
our ownership, which have not been audited or reviewed by auditors and no procedures have been compiled or
performed with respect to such financial information. Our auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed
any procedures with respect to such financial information and, accordingly, do not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance with respect thereto. The amounts attributable to Aleris included in our presentation of Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and other information presented for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 herein have not
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X or any other securities laws relating to the
presentation of pro forma financial information, are presented for illustrative purposes only, do not purport to be
indicative of the contribution that Aleris would have made to these figures had such businesses been included in our
operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and do not purport to project our future operating results.
In addition, the financial information for Aleris for the period from April 1, 2020 (which is the day after the last date
included in our unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum) through April 14, 2020 (which is the date we acquired Aleris) is not included in any financial
information presented or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

Furthermore, the financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 presented in this
offering memorandum gives pro forma effect to the Aleris Transactions and this offering and the application of the
net proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds” and has been separately prepared from, and is not based on,
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum.

**_Holders of the notes may be subject to certain foreign exchange risks relating to the euro, including the_**
**_effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as possible exchange controls._**

The initial investors in the notes will be required to pay for the notes in euro. Neither the Issuer nor the initial
purchasers will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euro or in converting other currencies into euro
to facilitate the payment of the purchase price for the notes. An investment in any security denominated in, and all
payments with respect to which are to be made in, a currency other than the currency of the country in which an
investor in the notes resides or the currency in which an investor conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s
home currency”), entails significant risks not associated with a similar investment in a security denominated in the
investor’s home currency. In the case of the notes, these risks may include the possibility of:

      - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and

      - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the investor’s
home currency.

We have no control over a number of factors affecting the notes and foreign exchange rates, including
economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of
these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result from the
interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in the countries
issuing such currencies, as well as economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries.
Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation,
existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries and the extent of governmental
surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade
policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance. The exchange
rates of an investor’s home currency for euro and the fluctuations in those exchange rates that have occurred in the
past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations therein that may occur in the future.
Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would result in a decrease in the investor’s home
currency equivalent yield on a note, in the investor’s home currency equivalent of the principal payable at the maturity
of that note and generally in the investor’s home currency equivalent market value of that note. Appreciation of the
euro in relation to the investor’s home currency would have the opposite effects. The EU or one or more of its Member
States may, in the future, impose exchange controls and modify any exchange controls imposed, which controls could
affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of euro at the time of payment of principal of, interest on, or any


-----

redemption payment or additional amounts with respect to, the notes. In addition, there may be tax consequences to
you as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses from any investment in the notes. See “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” if you are a U.S. holder of the notes whose_
functional currency is the U.S. dollar.

Furthermore, the indenture and the notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Under New
York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes would be required to render the judgment in euro.
However, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of
the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until
a New York state court judgment is entered, and we cannot predict how long this would take. A federal court sitting
in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the notes would apply the foregoing
New York law. In courts outside New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than
U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the notes in many other U.S. federal or state
courts ordinarily would be rendered in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of
conversion of euro into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment
and when the judgment is rendered.

This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in securities,
including, in particular, the notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an investor’s home currency.
You should consult your own financial, legal and tax advisors as to the risks involved in an investment in the notes.

**_Holders of the notes will receive payments solely in euro._**

All payments of interest on and the principal of the notes and any redemption price for the notes will be made
in euro. The Issuer, the initial purchasers, the trustee and the paying agent with respect to the notes will not be obligated
to convert, or to assist any registered owner or beneficial owner of such notes in converting, payments of interest,
principal, any redemption price or any additional amount in euro made with respect to such notes into U.S. dollars or
any other currency.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ commissions and
estimated offering expenses, will be approximately €500 million (or approximately $595 million, using the exchange
rate of $1.19 = €1.00 at 6:00 p.m. London time on March 18, 2021).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to (i) repay a portion of the 2017 Term Loans, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and (ii) pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing and this
offering of the notes. In addition, we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds received from this offering
to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing Eligible Green Projects, as described below. Certain of the initial
purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the 2017 Term Loans and as a result will receive proceeds
from the offering.

**_Eligible Green Projects_**

We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to finance or refinance, in whole
or in part, new or existing Eligible Green Projects. Eligible Green Projects may include new projects or existing
projects with expenditures not earlier than 36 months prior to the issuance date of the notes.

“Eligible Green Projects” consist of the following types of projects:

      - _Renewable Energy. Investments for new renewable energy generation, which may include power_
purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) and the investment in or installation of renewable energy generation
such as solar and wind with direct emissions of less than 100g CO2 e/kWh; and

      - _Pollution Prevention & Control. Expenditures related to the acquisition, production, construction,_
maintenance, operation, improvements and research and development of circular economy
processes that enable the reduction of primary metal aluminum usage, collection and aluminum
scrap closed loop recycling centers.

We anticipate that our allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering of the notes to
finance and/or refinance new and/or existing Eligible Green Projects will be in alignment with the Green Bond
Principles, 2018 (the “Green Bond Principles”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association
(“ICMA”), and we expect to apply the relevant requirements in the management of our use of proceeds as appropriate.
The Green Bond Principles are a set of voluntary guidelines for the issuance of green bonds and are intended to
promote integrity in the green bond market through guidelines that recommend transparency, disclosure and reporting.
The Green Bond Principles have four components:

  - use of proceeds for qualifying projects with environmentally sustainable benefits;

  - disclosure and use of a process for project evaluation and selection;

  - management of proceeds through a formal process to ensure they are allocated to Eligible Green Projects;
and

  - reporting on the use of proceeds, including on the projects for which funds have been used and their expected
environmentally sustainable impacts, where feasible.

We have engaged Sustainalytics, an independent environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) and
corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firm, to (i) help us develop a green bond framework (the “Green
Bond Framework”), define the Eligible Green Projects and assess our processes for alignment with the Green Bond
Principles, and (ii) obtain and make publicly available the Second-Party Opinion in respect of such green bond
framework and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles. The Second-Party Opinion and the Green Bond
Framework will be publicly available on our website http://www.novelis.com/sustainability. Please note that such
information and materials found on, or accessible through, our website, are not part of this offering memorandum and
are not incorporated by reference herein.


-----

_Process for Project Evaluation and Selection_

A Green Bond Committee comprised of the CEO, CFO, Regional President, Vice President of Strategy and
Sustainability and Director of Sustainability will be responsible for the assessment and selection of Eligible Green
Projects, ensuring alignment with our Green Bond Framework. In addition, Eligible Green Projects allocated funding
will undergo an internal process, including final review and approval by our CFO.

_Management of Proceeds_

Our finance department, comprised of Accounting, Treasury and Financial Planning & Analysis will track
the actual amount of net proceeds from the sale of the notes spent on Eligible Green Projects. Pending allocation, an
amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the notes may be temporarily invested in cash, cash equivalents,
and/or held in accordance with our internal liquidity policy.

_Reporting_

Annually, until such time as an amount equal to the net proceeds from this Offering have been fully allocated
to Eligible Green Projects, and on a timely basis in case of material developments, we will publish a publicly available
report (the “Green Bond Report”) on our website http://www.novelis.com/sustainability detailing, at a minimum: (i)
the amount of net proceeds allocated to each Eligible Green Project; (ii) expected impact metrics of our investment in
Eligible Green Projects, where feasible (the “Impact Metrics”); (iii) a selection of brief project descriptions; and (iv)
the outstanding amount of net proceeds of the notes to be allocated to Eligible Green Projects at the end of the relevant
reporting period.

Examples of our expected Impact Metrics may include, where feasible:

_Renewable Energy_ - Renewable energy capacity sourced and developed (in MW);

             - Renewable energy procured and produced from the capacity above (in MWh);

             - Emissions (in metric tons of CO2e) avoided or reduced; and

             - Annual renewable energy procured and produced as a percentage of annual global
electricity consumption.


_Pollution Prevention &_
_Control_



- Reduction of primary metal aluminum usage (kt);

- Emissions (in metric tons of CO2e) avoided or reduced; and

- Progress against or achievement of mitigating all emissions associated with Scope
1 and Scope 2.


The Green Bond Report will be accompanied by (i) assertions by our management that the net proceeds from
the sale of the notes have been allocated to Eligible Green Projects, temporarily invested in accordance with our
investment policy or used to repay existing debt and (ii) a report from an independent registered public accounting
firm in respect of its examination of our management’s assertions, which will be conducted in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

Information contained on, or accessible through, our website and in our Green Bond Report are not
incorporated in, and are not part of, this offering memorandum or any report or filing we make with the SEC. The
above description of the use of the proceeds from the sale of the notes is not intended to modify or add any covenant
or other contractual obligation undertaken by us under the notes or the indenture governing the notes.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

As of December 31, 2020, the senior secured credit facilities consisted of (i) a $2.5 billion secured term loan
credit facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and (ii) a $1.5 billion asset based loan facility (the “ABL Revolver”). As of
December 31, 2020, no amount of the Term Loan Facility is due within one year.

In January 2017, the Parent borrowed $1.8 billion of term loans (the “2017 Term Loans”) under the Term
Loan Facility. The 2017 Term Loans mature on June 2, 2022 and are subject to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments.
The 2017 Term Loans accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.85% per annum.

In April 2020, Novelis Acquisitions LLC borrowed $775 million of term loans (the “2020 Term Loans”)
under the Term Loan Facility immediately prior to its merger into Aleris. The proceeds of the 2020 Term Loans were
used to pay a portion of the consideration payable for the acquisition of Aleris (including the repayment of certain
indebtedness of Aleris) as well as fees and expenses related to the acquisition and the 2020 Term Loans. The 2020
Term Loans mature on January 21, 2025 and are subject to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments. The 2020 Term
Loans accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum.

On March 11, 2021, the Parent obtained commitments to borrow $500 million of term loans (the “2021 Term
Loans”) under the Term Loan Facility, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent. The Parent expects
to borrow the 2021 Term Loans on or about March 31, 2021. The 2021 Term Loans will mature on or about March
31, 2028 and will be subject to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments. The 2021 Term Loans will accrue interest at
LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. The proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan will be applied to refinance $500 million of the
2017 Term Loans. Immediately after giving effect to such refinancing, $633 million of 2017 Term Loans, $769 million
of 2020 Term Loans and $500 million of 2021 Term Loans will be outstanding.

The Term Loan Facility requires customary mandatory prepayments with excess cash flow, asset sale and
casualty event proceeds and proceeds of prohibited indebtedness, all subject to customary exceptions. The loans under
the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid, in full or in part, at any time at our election without penalty or premium. The
Term Loan Facility allows for additional term loans to be issued under the Term Loan Facility in an amount not to
exceed $300 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) plus an unlimited amount if, after giving effect to such
incurrences on a pro forma basis, the senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.00 to 1.00. The Term Loan
Facility also allows for additional term loans to be issued under the Term Loan Facility to refinance existing term
loans under the Term Loan Facility, subject to customary terms and conditions. The lenders under the Term Loan
Facility have not committed to provide any such additional or refinancing term loans.

In August 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver to permit the
amendment to our Short Term Loan Credit Agreement described below and to modify certain other credit agreement
terms to increase our operating flexibility.

On March 5, 2021, we amended the ABL Revolver to permit assignments of loans and commitments to US
branches of certain non-US banks.

In April 2019, we amended and extended the ABL Revolver (the “ABL Amendment”). The commitments
under the ABL Revolver were increased from $1 billion to $1.5 billion on October 15, 2019 pursuant to the terms of
the ABL Amendment. Aleris and certain of its subsidiaries became borrowers under the ABL Revolver upon closing
of the Aleris Acquisition, and the ABL Amendment included additional changes to facilitate the Aleris Acquisition
and increase our operating flexibility.

The ABL Revolver is a senior secured revolver bearing an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25% to
1.75% or a prime rate plus a prime spread of 0.25% to 0.75% based on excess availability. The ABL Revolver has a
provision that allows the facility to be increased by an additional $750 million, subject to lenders providing
commitments for the increase. The ABL Revolver has various customary covenants including maintaining a specified
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1 if excess availability is less than the greater of (1) $115 million and
(2) 10% of the lesser of (a) the maximum size of the ABL Revolver and (b) the borrowing base. The ABL Revolver
matures on April 15, 2024; provided that, in the event that the Term Loan Facility or certain other indebtedness is


-----

outstanding 90 days prior to its maturity (and not refinanced with a maturity date later than October 15, 2024, then the
ABL Revolver will mature 90 days prior to the maturity date for such other indebtedness, as applicable; unless excess
availability under the ABL Revolver is at least (i) 20% of the lesser of (x) the total ABL Revolver commitment and
(y) the then applicable borrowing base and (ii) 15% of the lesser of (x) the total ABL Revolver commitment and (y)
the then applicable borrowing base, and a minimum fixed charge ratio test of at least 1.25 to 1 is met.

The senior secured credit facilities contain various affirmative covenants, including covenants with respect
to our financial statements, litigation and other reporting requirements, insurance, payment of taxes, employee benefits
and (subject to certain limitations) causing new subsidiaries to pledge collateral and guarantee the loans and other
obligations secured in connection with such credit facilities. The senior secured credit facilities also include various
customary negative covenants and events of default, including limitations on our ability to (1) incur additional
indebtedness, (2) sell certain assets, (3) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (4) make investments, loans and
advances, (5) pay dividends or returns of capital and distributions beyond certain amounts, (6) engage in mergers,
amalgamations or consolidations, (7) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and (8) prepay certain indebtedness.
The term loan credit agreement also contains a financial maintenance covenant that, prohibits our senior secured net
leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter period and measured on a rolling four quarter basis from
exceeding 3.50 to 1.00, subject to customary equity cure rights. The senior secured credit facilities include a crossdefault provision under which lenders could accelerate repayment of the loans if a payment or non-payment default
arises under any other indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of more than $100 million (or, in the case of
the Term Loan Facility, under the ABL Revolver regardless of the amount outstanding). The senior secured credit
facilities are guaranteed by the Parent’s direct parent, AV Metals Inc., and certain of the Parent’s direct and indirect
subsidiaries and subject to certain specified exceptions are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the
borrowers and the guarantors under the senior secured credit facilities. As of December 31, 2020, we were in
compliance with the covenants in the Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the outstanding 2017 Term Loans,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereof. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Short Term Loans**

In February 2020, we entered into the Short Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Short Term Loan Credit
Agreement provided commitments of certain financial institutions for $1.1 billion of Short Term Loans that were
funded on the closing date of the Aleris Acquisition. The proceeds of the Short Term Loans were used to pay a portion
of the consideration payable for the acquisition of Aleris (including the repayment of certain indebtedness of Aleris
and its subsidiaries) as well as fees and expenses related to the acquisition and the Short Term Loans. The Short Term
Loans are unsecured, were originally scheduled to mature on April 13, 2021, are not subject to any amortization
payments, and originally accrued interest at LIBOR (as defined in the Short Term Loan Credit Agreement) plus 0.95%.
The Short Term Loans are guaranteed by the same entities that have provided guarantees under the Term Loan Facility
and ABL Revolver.

In August 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Short Term Loan Credit Agreement to extend the
maturity from April 13, 2021 to April 13, 2022, increase the interest rate if the Short Term Loans remained outstanding
past April 13, 2021 and require the grant of a junior-ranking security interest, subject to the terms of our existing
intercreditor agreement if the Short Term Loans remained outstanding past April 13, 2021.

The Short Term Loan Credit Agreement contains voluntary prepayment provisions, affirmative and negative
covenants and events of default substantially similar to those under the Term Loan Facility, other than changes to
reflect the unsecured and short term nature of the Short Term Loans. The Short Term Credit Agreement contains
mandatory prepayment provisions related to debt and equity proceeds, asset sales, casualty losses, and condemnations,
subject to certain reinvestment rights and exceptions.

The Short Term Loans were repaid in full on March 16, 2021.

**Senior Notes**

In January 2020, we issued $1.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2030 (the
“2030 Notes”). The proceeds were used to refinance all of Novelis Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024 and


-----

to pay a portion of the consideration for the Aleris Acquisition. The 2030 Senior Notes are subject to semi-annual
interest payments and mature on January 30, 2030 and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured
basis, by Novelis Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

On September 14, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due
2026 (the “2026 Notes,” and together with the 2030 Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The 2026 Notes are subject to semiannual interest payments and mature on September 30, 2026 and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior
unsecured basis, by Novelis Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

The Senior Notes contain customary covenants and events of default that limit our ability and, in certain
instances, the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (1) incur additional debt and provide additional guarantees, (2)
pay dividends or return capital beyond certain amounts and make other restricted payments, (3) create or permit certain
liens, (4) make certain asset sales, (5) use the proceeds from the sales of assets and subsidiary stock, (6) create or
permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us, (7)
engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (8) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (9) designate subsidiaries
as unrestricted subsidiaries and (10) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets
of certain of our subsidiaries. During any future period in which either of Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s have assigned
an investment grade credit rating to the Senior Notes and no default or event of default under the indenture has occurred
and is continuing, most of the covenants will be suspended. The Senior Notes include a cross-acceleration event of
default triggered if any other indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of more than $100 million is (1)
accelerated prior to its maturity or (2) not repaid at its maturity. The Senior Notes also contain customary call
protection provisions for our bondholders that extend through September 2024 for the 2026 Notes and through January
2028 for the 2030 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants in the indentures
governing the Senior Notes.

**China Bank Loans**

In September 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with the Bank of China to provide up to $75 million
in unsecured loans to support previously announced capital expansion projects in China.

**Assumed debt in connection with the Aleris Acquisition**

Through the acquisition of Aleris on April 14, 2020, the Company assumed $141 million in debt borrowed
by Aleris Aluminum (Zhenjiang) Co., Ltd. (“Aleris Zhenjiang”) under a loan agreement comprised of non-recourse
multi-currency secured term loan facilities and a revolving facility (collectively the “Zhenjiang Loans”), which
consisted of a $29 million U.S. dollar term loan facility, a $112 million (RMB 791 million) term loan facility
(collectively, the “Zhenjiang Term Loans”) and a revolving facility (the “Zhenjiang Revolver”). The Zhenjiang
Revolver has certain restrictions that have limited our ability to borrow funds on the Zhenjiang Revolver and will
continue to limit our ability to borrow funds in the future. All borrowings under the Zhenjiang Revolver mature May
18, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under the Zhenjiang Revolver. The Zhenjiang
Loans contain certain customary covenants and events of default.

The Zhenjiang Loans require Aleris Zhenjiang to, among other things, maintain a certain ratio of outstanding
term loans to invested equity capital. In addition, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, Aleris
Zhenjiang is restricted in its ability to (1) repay loans extended by the shareholder of Aleris Zhenjiang prior to repaying
loans under the Zhenjiang Loans or make the Zhenjiang Loans junior to any other debts incurred of the same class for
the project, (2) distribute any dividend or bonus to the shareholder of Aleris Zhenjiang before fully repaying the loans
under the Zhenjiang Loans, (3) dispose of any assets in a manner that will materially impair its ability to repay debts,
(4) provide guarantees to third parties above a certain threshold that use assets that are financed by the Zhenjiang
Loans, (5) permit any individual investor or key management personnel changes that result in a material adverse effect,
(6) use any proceeds from the Zhenjiang Loans for any purpose other than as set forth therein, and (7) enter into
additional financing to expand or increase the production capacity of the project to manufacture large scale and high
strength aluminum alloy plates. The interest rate on the U.S. dollar term facility is six month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus
5.0% and the interest rate on the RMB term facility and the Zhenjiang Revolver is 110% of the base rate applicable to
any loan denominated in RMB of the same tenor, as announced by the People’s Bank of China. As of December 31,
2020, $141 million was outstanding on the Zhenjiang Term Loans and the final maturity date for all borrowings is
May 16, 2024. The repayment of borrowings under the Zhenjiang Term Loans is due semi-annually.


-----

As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants of our Zhenjiang Loans.

**Amendments in Connection Logan Aluminum Joint Venture**

On December 11, 2020, the Parent entered into an amendment to its Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver
and an amendment to the Short Term Credit Agreement to ensure that the current structure of the Logan Aluminum
Inc. consolidated joint venture, in which we hold 40% ownership, complies with the terms of the Credit Agreements,
and permit an intercompany merger of two wholly-owned German subsidiaries.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Novelis Sheet Ingot GmbH, organized as a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
_Haftung) under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany (the “Issuer”) will issue €500 million aggregate_
principal amount of      % euro-denominated senior notes due     , 2029 (the “Notes”) under an indenture to
be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and
Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as paying agent
(the “Paying Agent”) and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as transfer agent (in such capacity, the “Transfer Agent”)
and registrar (in such capacity, the “Registrar”). The Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights, and will
be issued in private transactions that are exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (“TIA”) and will not be subject to
the terms thereof.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. It does not restate the
Indenture in its entirety. You should read the Indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a
holder of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture are available upon request to the Issuer at the address indicated under
“Where You Can Find More Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description
under the subheading “Certain Definitions.” In this description, the term “Company” refers only to Novelis Inc., the
indirect parent of the Issuer (or, following the occurrence of the Parent Guarantor Replacement Events, the New
Holding Parent), and not to any of its direct or indirect parent entities or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer is offering €500 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature
on       , 2029. The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Notes. The Issuer will issue the Notes in denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of      % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on      and     , commencing on     , 2021. Interest will be paid to those persons who were holders
of record on the       or      immediately preceding each interest payment date.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding.

**Additional Notes**

Subject to compliance with the limitations described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt,”
the Issuer may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes at later dates under the Indenture (the
“Additional Notes”). The Issuer can issue the Additional Notes as part of the same series as the Notes.

Any Additional Notes that the Issuer issues in the future will be identical in all respects to the Notes except
that Additional Notes issued in the future will have different issuance dates and may have different issuance prices.
The Notes offered hereby and the Additional Notes subsequently issued will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including directions, waivers, amendments, consents, redemptions and offers to
purchase; provided, that in the event that any Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will trade under a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP number or
other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued
Notes.

**Method of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Payments of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest with respect to Notes
represented by one or more Global Notes (as defined below) registered in the name of or held by a common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee, as applicable, will be made by the Paying Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holder or holders thereof. The rights of


-----

holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Payments of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest with respect to Notes held in
certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of the Paying
Agent maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on any Definitive Registered Notes may be paid at the
option of the Issuer by bank transfer to the holder thereof as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered
Notes.

**Listing of the Notes**

The Issuer will use all reasonable efforts to have the Notes admitted to listing and trading on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) after the Issue Date. The Issuer may cease to make or
maintain such listing on the Exchange at its sole option at any time provided that the Issuer will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized stock exchange for high yield
issuers (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union). There can be no assurance
that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned
on our making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes in London for so long as the Notes are
held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars and a transfer agent. The initial Registrar will be
Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the Initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.

The Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of definitive registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and
facilitate transfers of definitive registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Transfer Agent shall perform the
functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent without consent of, and prior notice
to, the holders of the Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed, and admitted for trading, on the Exchange and the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of a Paying Agent, Registrar or
Transfer Agent in accordance with the requirements of such rules.

**Transfer and Exchange**

Each series of the Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream.

Each series of the Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S
Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of
interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition,
transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected


-----

by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act. Any Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes that is transferred as
described in this paragraph will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the 144A Global Note from
which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Regulation S Global Note to which it was
transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is
expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange
for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental
charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge
to the holder of such Notes, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such
transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the
holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Ranking**

The Notes will:

    - be senior, unsecured obligations of the Issuer;

    - be effectively junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt of the Issuer (including
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing that debt;

    - be equal in right of payment (pari passu) with all existing and future unsecured senior debt of the
Issuer;

    - be structurally junior to debt of non-guarantors;

    - be senior in right of payment to all future subordinated debt of the Issuer; and

    - be guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by the Guarantors.

A significant portion of the Company’s operations are conducted through the Company’s other Restricted
Subsidiaries. Therefore, the Issuer will depend substantially on the cash flows of the other Restricted Subsidiaries
to service the Notes.

Because a significant portion of the Company’s operations are conducted through the Issuer and the other
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Company’s performance of its obligations under the Parent Guaranty will depend
substantially upon the cash flows of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including the Subsidiary Obligors), as well as the


-----

ability of the Subsidiary Obligors to distribute those cash flows to the Company as dividends, loans or other
payments. _See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—The Parent is primarily a holding_
_company and is dependent on its subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations,_
_including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our obligations under the Parent Guaranty.” Certain laws_
restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make loans and advances to it. The
Company’s ability to use the cash flows of those subsidiaries to fulfill its obligations under the Parent Guaranty will
be limited to the extent of any such restrictions. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, bankruptcy, “fraudulent
conveyance” laws or other similar laws could invalidate or limit the efficacy of the Subsidiary Guaranties. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—Fraudulent conveyance laws and other legal doctrines may_
_permit courts to void or subordinate the notes or the guarantees of the notes in specific circumstances, which would_
_prevent or limit payment under the notes or the guarantees. Certain limitations contained in the guarantees, which_
_are designed to avoid this result, may render the guarantees worthless.” Any of the situations described above could_
make it more difficult for the Company to service its debt, including its obligations under the Parent Guaranty and
the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.

Except to the extent of any intercompany loans or other advances, the Company only has a stockholder’s
claim in the assets of its subsidiaries. Its rights as a stockholder are junior in right of payment to the valid claims of
creditors of the Company’s subsidiaries against those subsidiaries. Holders of the Notes will only be creditors of the
Issuer, the Company and those subsidiaries of the Company that are Subsidiary Guarantors. In the case of
subsidiaries of the Company that are not Subsidiary Obligors, all the existing and future liabilities of those
subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors and preferred stockholders, will effectively rank senior to the
Notes.

As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to this offering and the application of
net proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the Company and its subsidiaries had $11,260 million
in total consolidated debt and other liabilities, of which $9,517 million was debt and other liabilities of the Company
and the Subsidiary Obligors and $1,743 million of which was debt and other liabilities of the Company’s other
subsidiaries. The Company and the Subsidiary Obligors and the Company’s other subsidiaries have other liabilities,
including contingent liabilities, that may be significant. The Indenture will limit the amount of additional Debt that
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur. Notwithstanding these limitations, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Obligors, may Incur substantial additional Debt. Debt may be Incurred either
by the Subsidiary Obligors or by the Company’s other subsidiaries.

The Notes and the Guaranties are unsecured obligations of the Subsidiary Obligors and the Parent
Guarantor, respectively. Secured Debt of the Subsidiary Obligors and the Parent Guarantor, including their
obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, will be effectively senior to the Notes and the Guaranties to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such Debt.

As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to this offering and the application of
net proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the outstanding secured Debt of the Company and
the Subsidiary Obligors on a consolidated basis was $2,041 million.

**Parent Guaranty**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, including the repurchase obligation resulting from a
Change of Control Triggering Event, will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, by the Parent Guarantor. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—Fraudulent conveyance laws and other legal doctrines
_may permit courts to void or subordinate the notes or the guarantees of the notes in specific circumstances, which_
_would prevent or limit payment under the notes or the guarantees. Certain limitations contained in the guarantees,_
_which are designed to avoid this result, may render the guarantees worthless.”_

The Parent Guarantor will be released from all its obligations under its Parent Guaranty either (i) in
connection with any legal defeasance of the Notes, (ii) upon satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or (iii) upon
the occurrence of the Parent Guarantor Replacement Events.


-----

**Subsidiary Guaranties**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, including the repurchase obligation resulting from a
Change of Control Triggering Event, will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by: (a)
all the existing U.S. Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company; (b) each of the Canadian Subsidiary Guarantors; (c)
each of Novelis do Brasil Ltda., Novelis UK Ltd., Novelis Europe Holdings Limited, Novelis Services Limited,
Novelis Aluminium Holding Unlimited Company, Novelis Deutschland GmbH, Aleris Deutschland Holding GmbH,
Aleris Rolled Products Germany GmbH, Aleris Casthouse Germany GmbH, Novelis AG, Novelis Switzerland SA,
Novelis PAE S.A.S. and Novelis MEA LTD.; (d) any other Restricted Subsidiary required to execute a Subsidiary
Guaranty under the terms of the Indenture; and (e) any other Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Subsidiary Guarantor under the terms of the Indenture that the Company elects, in its sole discretion, to cause to
become a Guarantor. See “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.” Each Subsidiary Guarantor’s
liability under its Subsidiary Guaranty will be limited to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the Issuer’s
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes or (ii) the amount, if any, which would not have (1) rendered the
Subsidiary Guarantor “insolvent” (as such term is defined in the Federal Bankruptcy Code and in the Debtor and
Creditor Law of the State of New York) or (2) left it with unreasonably small capital at the time its Subsidiary
Guaranty with respect to the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture and the Notes was entered into, after giving
effect to the incurrence of existing Debt immediately before such time. The liability of each existing or future
Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty will also be subject to the limitations applicable under local
law, including limitations related to corporate interest, insolvency, minimum capital requirements, financial
assistance and fraudulent conveyances. For example, the liability of each of Novelis Deutschland GmbH, Aleris
Deutschland Holding GmbH, Aleris Rolled Products Germany GmbH and Aleris Casthouse Germany GmbH under
its Subsidiary Guaranty will be limited to the extent that such entity’s net assets (Eigenkapital) may not fall below
the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) as a result of the enforcement of the Subsidiary Guaranty, that
such an enforcement must not result in a breach of the prohibition of insolvency causing intervention (Verbot des
_existenzvernichtenden Eingriffs) or that such an enforcement must not deprive such entity of the liquidity necessary_
to fulfill its financial liabilities to its creditors to the extent provided for by law. With respect to the Subsidiary
Guarantors organized under Swiss law, namely, Novelis AG and Novelis Switzerland S.A., the liability of each such
Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty will be limited to the maximum amount of its profits and
reserves available for distribution. Similar limitations may apply with respect to Subsidiary Guarantors in other
jurisdictions.

The Subsidiary Obligors currently generate most of the Company’s consolidated net sales and own most
of its consolidated assets. The subsidiaries of the Company that will not be Subsidiary Obligors following the
consummation of this offering represented the following approximate percentages of (a) net sales, (b) EBITDA and
(c) total assets of the Company, in each case, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Aleris Transactions and
this offering and the application of net proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds:”

    - 25.1% of the Company’s consolidated net sales are represented by net sales to third parties by
subsidiaries that are _not_ Subsidiary Obligors under the Indenture (for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020);

    - 17.9% of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA is represented by the subsidiaries that are _not_
Subsidiary Obligors under the Indenture (for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020);

    - 15.7% of the Company’s consolidated assets are owned by subsidiaries that are _not_ Subsidiary
Obligors under the Indenture (as of December 31, 2020).

If the Company or a Subsidiary Obligor, sells or otherwise disposes of either:

(1) its ownership interest in a Subsidiary Guarantor, or

(2) all or substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor,

then the Subsidiary Guarantor so sold or disposed of will be released from all of its obligations under its Subsidiary
Guaranty without any further demand. In addition, if, consistent with the requirements of the Indenture, the
Company designates a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an


-----

Excluded Subsidiary in accordance with the definition of “Excluded Subsidiary”, the designated Subsidiary
Guarantor will be released from all its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty. See “—Certain Covenants—
_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Property.” A_
Subsidiary Guarantor will also be released from all its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty (i) upon satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture, (ii) upon the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant
defeasance option, (iii) to the extent such Subsidiary Guarantor is released from any and all Guarantees of Debt
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any other Credit Facilities incurred under clause (b) of the definition
of “Permitted Debt”, (iv) in accordance with the second paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary
_Guarantors” or (v) upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor following the transfer of all or_
substantially all of its assets to the Company, the Issuer or another Guarantor.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any
successor of any of the foregoing (each a “Payor”), under or with respect to the Notes or any Guaranty shall be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, unless the deduction
or withholding of such Taxes is required by law. If any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed by or on behalf of or levied within (i) the Federal Republic of Germany, (ii) any jurisdiction from or through
which payment on the Notes or a Guaranty is made for or on behalf of a Payor, (iii) any other jurisdiction in which
a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be resident or has a permanent establishment for tax purposes or
any (iv) province, municipality or other political subdivision or taxing authority in or of any such jurisdiction under
foregoing (i) through (iii) (any such jurisdiction under foregoing (i) through (iv) a “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction”), will
at any time be required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or
any Subsidiary Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or any Guaranty, the relevant Payor shall pay (together
with such payment) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect
of such payments after such withholding or deduction (including any deduction or withholding from such additional
amounts) shall equal the respective amounts that would have been receivable in respect of the relevant Notes, in the
absence of such deduction or withholding (the aggregate of such additional amounts, “Additional Amounts”), except
that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the
holder or beneficial owner of a Note (or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder
of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) having or having
had any present or former connection (pursuant to applicable Tax law of the Relevant Jurisdiction) with
the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, including, without limitation, having been treated as a resident of the
Relevant Jurisdiction, being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business in the Relevant
Jurisdiction, or having or having had a permanent establishment in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (other
than any connection arising from the mere acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note, the
enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Guaranty, or the receipt of any payments in respect of
such Note or any Guaranty);

(b) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment
on or with respect to the Notes or any Guaranty;

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property, excise, wealth, transfer or similar
Taxes;

(d) any United States federal backup withholding Taxes;

(e) any Taxes imposed on a payment on a Note presented for payment (where presentation
is required for payment) by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by
presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union or in the
United Kingdom;

(f) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the
failure of the holder, following the written request of the Payor, the Paying Agent, or any other person


-----

acting as an agent for any Payor or the Paying Agent addressed to the holder (and made at a time that would
enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request, and in all events, at
least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be required), to comply with any certification,
identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction
in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide
such certification or documentation;

(g) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed under section
1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum (and any amended or successor
version of such sections that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with),
including any current or future treasury regulations or other official interpretations thereunder or any law,
regulation or official guidance implementing an intergovernmental agreement between a non--U.S.
government and the United States with respect to the foregoing;

(h) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of
the Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first
made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last of day of such 30 day period);

(i) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed on or with respect
to any payments under, or with respect to, the Notes or under or with respect to any Guaranty by reason of
the holder being, or having been a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial
owner of any such payments to the extent that such Taxes would not have been imposed or required to be
withheld or deducted on such payments had the beneficial owner of the applicable Notes been the holder
of such Note; or

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

In cases where the deduction or withholding of Taxes on or with respect to any payments under or with
respect to the Notes or with respect to any Guaranty is required by law to be made by a Payor, the Payor will (i)
make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain tax
receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Tax Jurisdiction imposing
such Taxes and will furnish to a holder upon written request within a reasonable time after the date the payment of
any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing payment by the Payor, or if,
notwithstanding the Payor’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other reasonably satisfactory
evidence of payments by the Payor.

If the Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such
payment, at least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guaranty
is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 45[th] day prior to such date, in
which case it must be delivered promptly thereafter), the Payor will deliver to the Paying Agent an Officers’
Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts estimated to be payable and such
other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to inform the relevant holders of the notes of the payment
of such Additional Amounts.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including penalties and interest related
thereto) which arise from the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of the Notes or any Guaranty or any other
document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt of any payments with
respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes or any Note Guarantee (limited, in the case of any such taxes, charges or


-----

levies that arise from the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes, to any such taxes, charges or levies that
are not excluded under items (a) and (c) through (i) of the first paragraph of this covenant).

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment or non-payment of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, interest or any other amount
payable under or with respect to any Note or any Guaranty, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the
payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be
payable in respect thereof.

The above obligation will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any
transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which
any successor Person to the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor is organized or otherwise
considered to be resident or conducts business for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any
payment on the Notes or any Guaranty is made by or on behalf of the Issuer, or any Guarantor (or any successor
thereto) and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer, the Parent
Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes. Any amount received or recovered
in a currency other than euro (the “Required Currency”), which is made to or for the account of any holder in lawful
currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Judgment Currency”), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the
enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a Subsidiary Guarantor, shall constitute
a discharge of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor’s or the Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture, the
Notes and the Guaranties, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency with such
holder, as the case Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the Required Currency originally
due to such holder, as the case may be, the Issuer shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder, as the case may be,
from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute
an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture and shall give rise to
a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder from
time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum
in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Optional Redemption**

Commencing     , 2024, the Issuer may, from time to time, redeem all or any portion of the Notes at the
redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date). The following prices are for Notes redeemed during the 12 month period
commencing on      of the years set forth below, and are expressed as percentages of principal amount:

**Period** **Redemption Price**
2024 ................................................................................................ %
2025 ................................................................................................ %
2026 and thereafter ........................................................................ 100.000%

At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may, from time to time, redeem all or any portion of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to the greater of:

(a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, and

(b) the sum of the present values of (1) the redemption price of the Notes at     , 2024 (as
set forth in the preceding paragraph) and (2) the remaining scheduled payments of interest from the
redemption date through     , 2024, but excluding accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption
date, discounted to the redemption date (assuming a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30 day months), at
the Bund Rate plus 50 basis points (the “Applicable Premium”),


-----

plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption
date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date).

In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to a maximum
of 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) with an amount up
to the proceeds of one or more Qualified Equity Offerings at a redemption price equal to      % of the principal
amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that after giving effect to any such redemption,
at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) remains
outstanding (unless all Notes are redeemed concurrently). Notice of any such redemption shall be made within 90
days of such Qualified Equity Offering.

**Early Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

If (i) any Payor becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts as set forth under “Payment of Additional
_Amounts” above, (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the taking of reasonable measures available to the Payor_
and (iii) the requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any change in or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been
publicly announced as formally proposed before, and which becomes effective on or after, the Issue Date
or, if a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction has changed since the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction became an applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction pursuant to the Indenture (the “Relevant Tax
_Jurisdiction Date”); or_

(b) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an
official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a
change in published practice), which change, amendment, application or interpretation has not been
publicly announced as formally proposed before, and becomes effective on or after, the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction Date (each of the foregoing in clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Notes may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Issuer, upon not less than 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date, at 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and
Additional Amounts, if any, then due and that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the
redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof).

Prior to giving any notice of redemption pursuant to this provision, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee
(i) an Officers’ Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement
of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred and (ii) an
Opinion of Counsel qualified under the laws of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction to the effect that the Payor has been
or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee shall be
entitled to accept such Officers’ Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of such
conditions precedent, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the holders.

No notice of redemption pursuant to this provision may be given (i) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest
date on which the Payor would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the Notes
then due, or (ii) if at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts does not remain
in effect.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor
is incorporated or organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.


-----

**Selection and Notice**

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds of a Qualified Equity Offering)
or any offer to purchase (including in connection with a Change of Control, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer),
any such redemption or purchase may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including the completion of any related financing or Qualified Equity Offering. In addition, if such redemption or
notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s sole
discretion, the redemption or purchase date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such
notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption
or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed, and that such redemption or purchase provisions
may be adjusted to comply with the requirements of any depositary for the Notes. In addition, the Issuer may provide
in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s other obligations
with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by a direct or indirect parent of the Issuer to the
extent such parent performs such obligations in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to such redemption or purchase.

We understand that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if less than all of the Notes are
to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis by use of a pool factor, in compliance with their respective requirements and procedures (as
applicable); provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed
in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent or the Registrar will be liable to any person for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture or to the extent the conditions precedent in a conditional optional redemption have not been satisfied.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued
in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein),
Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless
the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions of them
called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange
so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes and, in
connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

Any notice to holders of Notes of such redemption shall include the appropriate calculation of the
redemption price, but need not include the redemption price itself. The actual redemption price, calculated as
described above, shall be set forth in an Officers’ Certificate delivered to the Trustee no later than two Business
Days prior to the redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described
under “—Change of Control Offer” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.” The Issuer or its
Affiliates may at any time and from time to time acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender
offer, exchange offer, in open market purchases, through negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with


-----

applicable securities laws, upon such terms and at such prices as the Issuer or its Affiliates may determine, which
may be more or less than the consideration for which the Notes offered hereby are being sold and may be less than
the redemption price then in effect and could be for cash or other consideration.

**Change of Control Offer**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will be required to make an offer
to each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (in denominations of €100,000 or any integral multiple of
€1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control
_Offer”) at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,_
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the repurchase date (subject to the right of holders of record
on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer shall:

(a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Triggering Event to be sent at least once to the
Dow Jones News Service or similar business news service in the United States; and

(b) send by first-class mail or electronic delivery, with a copy to the Trustee, to each holder
of Notes at such holder’s address appearing in the security register, a notice stating:

(1) that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and a Change of
Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control Offer” and that
all Notes timely tendered will be accepted for payment;

(2) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the repurchase date, which shall be,
subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no earlier than 30 days
nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically to the holder
of Notes;

(3) the circumstances regarding the Change of Control Triggering Event; and

(4) the procedures that holders of Notes must follow in order to tender their Notes
(or portions thereof) for payment, and the procedures that holders of Notes must follow in order
to withdraw an election to tender Notes (or portions thereof) for payment.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in
connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the
Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal
to or higher than the Change of Control Purchase Price and has purchased all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of
Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is
in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer is made, in which case
no Change of Control Offer will be required to be made after the related Change of Control Triggering Event.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer or Alternate Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will
not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of such compliance.

For so long as the Notes are listed the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will
notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.


-----

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control
purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers of the Notes. The Company
and the Issuer have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is
possible that the Company or the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed
below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the
amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on
our ability to incur additional Debt are contained in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Debt.” Such restrictions can be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the_
Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, transfer, assignment, lease,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” the Property of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, if the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, dispose of less than all this Property by any of the means described
above, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes may be uncertain. In such a case,
holders of the Notes may not be able to resolve this uncertainty without resorting to legal action.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide that certain of the events that would constitute a Change of
Control would also constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and entitle the lenders under those
facilities to require that such debt be repaid. The indentures governing our Existing Notes provide, and other future
debt of the Company may provide, that the occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control will
require such debt to be repurchased or repaid. Moreover, if holders of Notes exercise their right to require the Issuer
to repurchase such Notes, the Issuer could be in breach of obligations under existing and future debt of the Issuer.
Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then
existing financial resources. The Issuer cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s failure to repurchase Notes, as required following a Change of Control
Offer, would result in a Default under the Indenture. Such a Default would, in turn, constitute a default under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other existing debt of the Company and may constitute a default under future
debt as well. The Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of such Notes. See “—Amendments and Waivers.”

In connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer for the
Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such offer as described above,
purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right, upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, so long as such notice is given not
more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to a Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all
Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the price offered to
each other holder in such offer (which, if the offer is not a Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale
Offer, may be less than par and may consist of non-cash consideration) plus, to the extent not included in the offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Covenant Suspension_**

If the Notes receive an Investment Grade Rating from one of the Rating Agencies (or both Rating Agencies)
and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing then, beginning on that day and continuing until
the Investment Grade Rating assigned by that Rating Agency (or both Rating Agencies) to the Notes, subsequently
declines as a result of which the Notes do not carry an Investment Grade Rating from at least one Rating Agency
(such period being referred to as a “Suspension Period”), the covenants set forth in this section will be suspended


-----

(the “Suspended Covenants”) and will not be applicable during that Suspension Period, except for the covenants
described under the following headings:

    - the first paragraph under “—Limitation on Liens” (until the Company otherwise elects to have the third
paragraph under “—Limitation on Liens” apply as provided therein, in which case such third paragraph
under “—Limitation on Liens” shall apply), and

    - _“—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”_

The Company and the Subsidiary Obligors will also, during that Suspension Period, remain obligated to
comply with the provisions described under “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Property” (other than clause (d)
of the first and third paragraphs thereunder).

In the event that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants
for any Suspension Period, and, subsequently, the applicable Rating Agency (or both Rating Agencies) withdraws
its or their ratings or downgrades the ratings assigned to the Notes below the required Investment Grade Ratings or
a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will from
such date (the “Reinstatement Date”) and thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants. No Default, Event
of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties with
respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability
for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant
to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reinstatement Date, regardless of whether such actions or events
would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period.

On the Reinstatement Date, all (i) Debt Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the date of the Indenture, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (k) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described below under the caption “—Limitation on Debt” and (ii) all Liens incurred during the
Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred under clause (j) of the definition of “Permitted Liens.”
The amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be
determined as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior
to, but not during, the Suspension Period.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Board of Directors will not be entitled to designate any
Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary during a Suspension Period unless the Board of Directors would have been
entitled to designate such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if the Suspension Period had not been in effect
for any period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an Investment Grade Rating from one or both
Rating Agencies.

**_Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the Incurrence or issuance of Debt, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset
Sales), in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”),
the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction
is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of
any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test
_Date”) either (a) the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable,_
the date of delivery of an irrevocable notice, declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or (b) solely in
connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date
on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer or similar announcement or determination
in another jurisdiction subject to laws similar to the City Code in respect of a target of a Limited Condition
Transaction made in compliance with the City Code or similar laws or practices in other jurisdictions, and, in each
case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related


-----

thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the Incurrence or issuance of Debt, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales)
and any related pro forma adjustments and, at the election of the Issuer, any other acquisition or similar Investment,
Restricted Payment or Asset Sale that has not been consummated but with respect to which the Issuer has elected to
test any applicable condition prior to the date of consummation in accordance with this paragraph, as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the most recently completed four fiscal quarter period, the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries could have taken such actions or consummated such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in
compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket
(and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all
purposes (in the case of Debt, for example, whether such Debt is committed, issued or Incurred at the LCT Test
Date or at any time thereafter); provided that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters
shall have been delivered, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or baskets
on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to
be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the
foregoing clause (a) of this proviso, compliance with such ratios, tests or baskets (and any related requirements and
conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited
Condition Transaction and any such actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the
Incurrence or issuance of Debt, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence
of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales), and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of
the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative
interest margin contained in any financing commitment documentation with respect to such Debt or, if no such
indicative interest margin exists, as reasonably determined by the Issuer in good faith.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets
for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date
have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test
or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or total assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited
Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been
complied with as a result of such fluctuations (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary may rely upon any improvement in any such ratio, test or basket availability); (2) if any related
requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which
compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test
Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or
Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or
satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing for purposes
of the determination of such compliance or satisfaction); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test
or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following
the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is
consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in
an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested
giving _pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and other actions or transactions in connection_
therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof (but without netting the cash proceeds
thereof)) as if such Limited Condition Transaction had been consummated.

**_Certain Compliance Calculations_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Debt, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is Incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken
in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio
or Net Total Leverage Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other
transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any other basket (other than another ratio basket
based on the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or Net Total Leverage Ratio)

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant,

(1) in the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted

paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, divide, classify (and may later reclassify

as having been Incurred under clause (b) above and such Debt shall not thereafter be permitted to be reclassified
in whole or in part; and provided further, that subject to the preceding proviso, at any time the Company could

the actual Incurrence of such Debt, designate such commitment (any such commitment so designated, a
“Designated Commitment”) as being Debt Incurred on the date of such commitment in an amount equal to such
Designated Commitment (or, at the Company’s option, if such Designated Commitment has been permanently
reduced other than as a result of the Incurrence of funded Debt thereunder, such reduced amount), in which
case Debt in such amount shall be deemed to have been Incurred on the date of such commitment and shall
thereafter be deemed to be outstanding Senior Debt secured by Liens for purposes of this “—Limitation on
Debt” covenant and any subsequent calculation of any ratio under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, and
subsequent borrowings and prepayments under such Designated Commitment shall be disregarded for all
purposes of the covenant described above and the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Liens” below until
the date such Designated Commitment is terminated.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company shall not make, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to make, directly or indirectly,

the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt,” or


-----

(c) the sum of the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted
Payments declared or made under this paragraph, together with Restricted Payments made pursuant to
clauses (a) and (e) of the second paragraph of this covenant since the Issue Date (the amount of any
Restricted Payment, if made other than in cash, to be based upon Fair Market Value at the time of such
Restricted Payment) would exceed an amount equal to the sum of:

(1) if positive, 50% of the aggregate amount of Consolidated Net Income accrued
during the period (treated as one accounting period) from October 1, 2010 to the end of the most
recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered (or if the aggregate
amount of Consolidated Net Income for such period shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit),
plus

(2) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash contributed to the capital of the Company
following the Prior Issue Date (other than (A) contributions from a Restricted Subsidiary and (B)
any Excluded Contributions); plus

(4) the sum of:

of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the Company’s consolidated

excluding, in the case of clause (A) or (B):

(I) any such Debt issued or sold to the Company or a Subsidiary
of the Company or a Company Equity Plan, and

(II) the aggregate amount of any cash or other Property
distributed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon any such
conversion or exchange, plus

(5) an amount equal to the sum of:

(A) dividends, repayments of loans or advances or other transfers of
Property, in each case to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, resulting from
Investments in any Person other than the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and

(B) the portion (proportionate to the Company’s equity interest in such
Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary at the time such Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, that the foregoing sum shall not exceed, in the case of any Person, the amount_
of Investments previously made (and treated as a Restricted Payment) by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Person, minus the sum of,

(6) $250.0 million, and

(7) the amount of outstanding Debt Incurred pursuant to clause (cc) of the definition
of “Permitted Debt” and any outstanding Permitted Refinancing Debt thereof as of the date of
determination.

the Company from the Prior Issue Date through the Issue Date. As of December 31, 2020, the amount available for
Restricted Payments pursuant to the paragraph above was approximately $2,100 million and the amount available

complies with this covenant (based on circumstances existing at the time of such reclassification), and following
such reclassification such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment shall be treated as having been made pursuant
to only the clause or clauses of this covenant to which such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment has been
reclassified.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

During any period other than a Suspension Period (and during any period that this paragraph shall apply
when there is no election by the Company pursuant to the third paragraph of this covenant), the Company shall not,
and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
to secure Specified Debt upon any of its Property (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether
owned at the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, unless it has made or will make effective provision whereby the
Notes or the applicable Guaranty will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with (or, if such other Debt
constitutes Subordinated Debt, prior to) all other Specified Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
secured by such Lien for so long as such other Specified Debt is secured by such Lien.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lien securing the Notes granted pursuant to this covenant shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) the release by the holders of the Debt described
above of their Lien on the Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release
upon payment in full of all obligations under such Debt), (b) any sale, exchange or transfer to any Person other than
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Property secured by such Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock
held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted
Subsidiary creating such Lien in each case in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as described under
“Subsidiary Guaranties,” (c) a defeasance or discharge of the Notes in accordance with the procedures described
below under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or (d) in connection with the release of a Subsidiary
Guarantor at the election of the Company pursuant to the second paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—Future
Subsidiary Guarantors.”

During any Suspension Period, the Company may elect by written notice to the Trustee and the holders of
the Notes to be subject to an alternative covenant with respect to “Limitation on Liens,” in lieu of the first paragraph


-----

of this “—Limitation on Liens.” Under this alternative covenant, the Company will not, and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur or assume any Lien securing Specified Debt (other than Permitted Liens
pursuant to clauses (c) through (j) and (1) (but disregarding the reference to clause (b) therein) through (t) (each
inclusive) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”) upon (1) any Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, (2) any Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary or (3) any Specified Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary
owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary, unless all payments due under the Indenture and the Notes
are secured on an equal and ratable basis with (or prior to) the obligations so secured until such time as such other
obligations are no longer secured by such lien. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during a Suspension Period, the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to create, incur and assume Liens, and renew, extend or
replace such Liens, in each case without complying with the foregoing; provided, that the aggregate amount of all
Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding at such time that is secured by these Liens (other
than (1) Debt secured solely by Permitted Liens pursuant to clauses (c) through (j) and (1) (but disregarding the
reference to clause (b) therein) through (t) (each inclusive) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” (2) Debt that is
secured equally and ratably with (or on a basis subordinated to) the Notes and (3) the Notes) would not exceed the
greater of (x) 15.0% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets and (y) $1,200.0 million.

In determining whether any Lien is permitted by this covenant, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may allocate all or any portion of such Permitted Lien among the categories described in clauses (a) through (ff) of
the definition of “Permitted Liens”; provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries may reclassify all or a portion
of such Permitted Liens in any manner that complies with this covenant (based on circumstances existing at the time
of such reclassification), and following such reclassification such Permitted Liens shall be treated as having been
made pursuant to only the clause or clauses of such covenant to which such Permitted Liens has been reclassified.

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
consummate any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such
Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the Property subject to such Asset Sale; and

(b) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration paid to
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Asset Sale, together with all other
Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), is in the form of any one or a combination of the
following: (i) cash, Cash Equivalents or Additional Assets, (ii) the assumption by the purchasers of
liabilities of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities or liabilities that
are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or the applicable Guaranty) as a result of which the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities, (iii) securities, notes
or other obligations received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such securities,
notes or other obligations are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash, Cash
Equivalents or Additional Assets within 180 days of such Asset Sale or (iv) Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, having an
aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the closing date of the applicable Asset Sale for which such
Designated Non-Cash Consideration is received), taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this clause (iv) that is at the time outstanding, not in excess of the greater
of (x) $400.0 million and (y) 5.0% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Company at the time of
the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration.

Within 450 days after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of any Net Available
Cash (or any portion thereof, if any) of such Asset Sale, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may, to the extent
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects (or is required by the terms of any Debt) apply an amount up to
the Net Available Cash from such Asset Sale:

(c) to Repay Senior Debt (and in the case of a revolving credit facility, to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto) of the Company or any Subsidiary Obligor that is secured by a
Lien, which Lien is permitted by the Indenture, or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary
Obligor (excluding, in any such case, any Debt owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company);


-----

(d) to Repay other Senior Debt (and in the case of a revolving credit facility, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto) of the Company or any Subsidiary Obligor
(excluding, in any such case, any Debt owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company); provided,
that to the extent the Company or any Subsidiary Obligor Repays Senior Debt other than the Notes pursuant
to this clause (b), the Company or any Subsidiary Obligor shall either (i) equally and ratably purchase such
Notes through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal
amount thereof) or redeem such Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” or (ii) make an offer
(in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders of such Notes to
purchase their Notes of such series at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued
but unpaid interest on the amount of such Notes that would otherwise be prepaid;

(e) to reinvest in Additional Assets (including by means of an Investment in Additional
Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted
Subsidiary);

(f) with respect to Asset Sales of assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary
Obligor, to permanently reduce Debt (and in the case of a revolving credit facility, to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto) of such Restricted Subsidiary (except that if the assets sold by
such Restricted Subsidiary were contributed to such Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, the proceeds
of the sale of such assets may only be used to repay Debt of such Restricted Subsidiary secured by such
assets) other than Debt owed to the Company or another Subsidiary; or

(g) any combination of the foregoing; provided that a binding commitment or letter of intent
entered into not later than such 450[th] day shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available
Cash from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that the Net
Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 450[th]

and 180 days of such commitment or letter of intent (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any
Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is
applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable
Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; _provided_
_further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net_
Available Cash is applied, then the Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of
the Net Available Cash of any Asset Sale by the Company or a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x)
prohibited or delayed by or would violate or conflict with applicable local law, (y) subject to other legal or regulatory
impediments from being repatriated to the United States or (z) would conflict with the fiduciary duties of such
Foreign Subsidiary’s directors, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal
or criminal liability for any Officer of such Foreign Subsidiary, then, in each such case, an amount equal to the
portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant,
and such amounts may be retained by the Company or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that if at any
time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such
repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable
organizational document or agreement or the applicable other impediment, then an amount equal to such amount of
Net Available Cash so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that
would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated)
in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that and for so long as the Company has determined in good
faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have a non-de
minimis adverse tax or cost consequence to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliates or direct or
indirect equity owners thereof (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection
with such repatriation in the year of such repatriation), including any withholding tax, with respect to such Net
Available Cash if such amount were repatriated as a dividend, the Net Available Cash so affected will not be required
to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign
Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not,


-----

for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the
Indenture shall be construed to require the Company or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

Any Net Available Cash from an Asset Sale (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set
forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that is not invested or applied as provided and within the time period
set forth in the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; _provided_ that any
amount of Net Available Cash offered to holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (b)(ii) in the second preceding
paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds regardless of whether such offer is accepted by any holders.
When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $280.0 million and (y) 3.5% of
Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale
_Offer”) to all holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Debt that ranks pari passu in_
right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari
Passu Indebtedness that is in an amount equal to €100,000, or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof that
may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in
the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an
Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed
the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash
from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the time period
that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Available Cash (the “Advance
_Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”)._

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the
Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess
Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale
Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase the Notes (subject to
applicable Euroclear and Clearstream procedures as to Global Notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case
may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes
or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the
requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess
Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining net
proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such net proceeds for any purpose not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Within five Business Days after the Issuer is obligated to make an Asset Sale Offer as described in the
preceding paragraph, the Issuer shall send a written notice, by first-class mail or electronic delivery, to the holders
of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, accompanied by such information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as the Issuer in good faith believes will enable such holders to make an informed decision with respect
to such Asset Sale Offer. Such notice shall state, among other things, the purchase price and the repurchase date,
which shall be, subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no earlier than 10 days nor
later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor
to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause any consensual restriction on the right of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital

other instrument of a Restricted Subsidiary existing at the time it became a Restricted
Subsidiary or at the time it merges with or into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
if such restriction was not created in connection with or in anticipation of the transaction

Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company, and, in each case, any
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, replacements, refundings,
refinancings, increases or supplements of those agreements and instruments; provided,
that the encumbrances or restrictions contained in any such amendments, modifications,

in good faith) or (3) will not materially impair the Issuer’s ability to make anticipated

in clause (1)(A), (B) or (C) above or in clause (2)(A) or (B) below, _provided_ such
restrictions (1) are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the holders of Notes

more disadvantageous, taken as a whole, with respect to the Company or any Restricted

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in
receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common
equity shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the
subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans and advances made to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt incurred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Limitations on Use of Proceeds_**

The net proceeds from each issue of Notes will be applied by the Issuer outside Switzerland unless use in
Switzerland is permitted under the Swiss taxation laws in force from time to time without payments in respect of
the Notes becoming subject to withholding or deduction for Swiss withholding tax as a consequence of such use of
proceeds in Switzerland

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, conduct
any business or enter into any transaction or series of transactions (including the purchase, sale, transfer, assignment,
lease, conveyance or exchange of any Property or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any
Affiliate of the Company (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or
consideration, in any one or series of transactions, in excess of $25.0 million, unless:

(a) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are not materially less favorable to the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable arm’s
length transaction with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company; and

(b) if such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate payments or value in excess of $100.0
million, the Board of Directors (including at least a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors) approves such Affiliate Transaction and, in its good faith judgment, believes that such Affiliate
Transaction complies with clause (a) of this paragraph as evidenced by a Board Resolution promptly
delivered to the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may enter into the
following, which shall not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and therefore will not be subject to the provisions
of clauses (a) and (b) above of this covenant:

(c) any transaction or series of transactions between the Company and one or more
Restricted Subsidiaries or between two or more Restricted Subsidiaries;

(d) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Investment;

(e) any employment, compensation, benefit or indemnification agreement or arrangement
(and any payments or other transactions pursuant thereto) entered into by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business (or that is otherwise reasonable as determined in good faith
by the board of directors of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) with an officer,
employee, consultant or director including pursuant to stock option plans, stock ownership plans and
employee benefit plans or arrangements;

(f) loans and advances to employees made in the ordinary course of business;

(g) any transactions between or among any of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary and
any Securitization Entity in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction, in each case provided,
that such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by terms of the Indenture;

(h) agreements in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, modifications, extensions
or renewals thereto that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary than such agreements as in effect on the Issue Date;


-----

(i) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Company solely because the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns Capital Stock of and/or controls, such
Person;

(j) payment of fees and expenses to directors who are not otherwise employees of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, for services provided in such capacity, so long as the Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof shall have approved the terms thereof;

(k) the granting and performance of registration rights for shares of Capital Stock of the
Company;

(l) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, joint venture partners or purchasers or
sellers of goods or services (including pursuant to joint venture agreements) in the ordinary course of
business on terms not materially less favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from
a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Company, as determined in good faith by the Company;

(m) transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Debt or Capital Stock
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided, that a significant amount of the Debt or Capital Stock
of the same class is also held by persons that are not Affiliates of the Company and those Affiliates are
treated no more favorably than holders of the Debt or Capital Stock generally;

(n) transactions in which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is
fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms
are not materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the Company or its relevant Restricted
Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis;

(o) the Aleris Transactions, the Note Transactions and the payment of all fees and expenses
related to the Aleris Transactions and the Note Transactions, including Transaction Costs;

(p) the German Reorganization;

(q) Permitted Intercompany Activities, any Permitted Reorganization or any Tax
Restructuring and related transactions; and

(r) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any
arrangement pursuant to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required or permitted
to file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax,
accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary of the Company to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if:

(a) the Subsidiary to be so designated does not own any Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or
hold any Lien on any Property of, the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; and

(b) either:

(1) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of $1,000 or less, or

(2) such designation is effective immediately upon such entity becoming a
Subsidiary of the Company, or

(3) the Investment by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary in such
Subsidiary is treated as a Restricted Payment under the covenant described under “—Limitation


-----

_on Restricted Payments” and such Restricted Payment is permitted under such covenant at the_
time such Investment is deemed to be made upon such designation.

Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, no Restricted Subsidiary may be designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary. Upon designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance
with this covenant, such Restricted Subsidiary shall, automatically and unconditionally without the need for action
by any party, be released from any Subsidiary Guaranty previously made by such Restricted Subsidiary.

Unless so designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, any Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Company
will be classified as a Restricted Subsidiary.

The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if,
immediately after giving pro forma effect to such designation,

(x) the Company could Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (1) of the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt,” and

(y) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result
therefrom.

Any such designation by the Board of Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee
a Board Resolution giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Certificate that:

(a) certifies that such designation complies with the foregoing provisions, and

(b) gives the effective date of such designation, such filing with the Trustee to occur within
45 days after the end of the fiscal quarter of the Company in which such designation is made (or, in the
case of a designation made during the last fiscal quarter of the Company’s fiscal year, within 90 days after
the end of such fiscal year).

**_Future Subsidiary Guarantors_**

The Company shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary, other than an Excluded Subsidiary or the Issuer, that
is or becomes a borrower or guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other Credit Facilities
incurred under clause (b) of the definition of “Permitted Debt,” in each case, following the Issue Date, to execute
and deliver to the Trustee a Subsidiary Guaranty within 60 days after the Incurrence or guarantee of any such Debt.

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be
a Subsidiary Guarantor to execute and deliver to the Trustee a Subsidiary Guaranty and become a Guarantor, in
which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period described above. In addition, the
Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any direct or indirect parent company of the Company to
guarantee the notes, and, for the avoidance of doubt, any direct or indirect parent company of the Company that
may guarantee the notes in the future shall not be subject to any of the covenants or restrictions of the Indenture.
Any guarantee of the notes provided by any such Subsidiary or direct or indirect parent company of the Company
may be released at any time in the Company’s sole discretion.

**_New Holding Parent Guaranty_**

In the event that Novelis Inc. becomes a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of a corporation, company
(including a limited liability company) or partnership newly organized under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United
States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, Canada or any province or territory of Canada or the United
Kingdom (“New Holding Parent”), New Holding Parent may, at its option, provide a Guarantee of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to the Notes (the “New Holding Parent Guaranty”) on substantially the same terms as the
Parent Guaranty and as set forth in the Indenture. Upon the occurrence of the following events (collectively, the
“Parent Guarantor Replacement Events”), Novelis Inc. shall be released from its obligations under the Parent
Guaranty, without limiting any other provision in the Indenture that would require Novelis Inc. to become a

Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such transaction or series of transactions and the applicable

precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction or series of transactions have been satisfied.

Neither the Company nor the Issuer shall merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into the other unless
the Surviving Person is a corporation, company (including a limited liability company) or partnership organized and
existing in the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and each Subsidiary Guarantor provides

(h) immediately before and after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions
on a _pro forma basis (and treating, for purposes of this clause (c) and clause (d) below, any Debt that_

(i) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a _pro_
_forma basis, (x) the Company or the Surviving Person, as the case may be, would be able to Incur at least_

the assets of the Company (or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable) as an entirety or virtually as an entirety, the
Company or the Issuer (or the Subsidiary Guarantor), as applicable, will automatically be released and discharged
from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.


-----

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the
Issuer shall publish notice of the occurrence of any of the events described in this “—Merger, Consolidation and
_Sale of Property” covenant in accordance with the prevailing rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority_
Limited.

**Reports and Other Information**

Whether or not required by the SEC, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the
holders, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations (as in effect on the Issue Date) for nonaccelerated filers:

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing
by a non-accelerated filer with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K (or any successor or comparable forms) if the
Company were required to file such forms, including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and, with respect to the annual information only, a report on the annual
financial statements by the Company’s certified independent accountants; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Company
were required to file such reports.

The Company will be deemed to have furnished to the holders the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2)
of the first paragraph of this covenant if the Company has either (i) filed such reports with the SEC (and such reports
are publicly available), (ii) posted such reports on the Company Website, made such reports available to the Trustee
and issued a press release in respect thereof or (iii) when not otherwise filing such reports with the SEC, posted such
reports on IntraLinks or any comparable password protected online data system requiring user identification and a
confidentiality acknowledgment; provided that in all cases the Company shall make such information available to
securities analysts and prospective investors upon request; and provided further that, solely to the extent that the
Company elects to comply with this covenant as described in clause (iii) above, the Company shall, not later than
ten Business Days after providing the information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant, hold a publicly accessible conference call to discuss such information for the relevant fiscal period and
issue a press release in respect thereof no fewer than three Business Days prior to the date of such conference call.

For purposes of this covenant, the term “Company Website” means the collection of web pages that may
be accessed on the World Wide Web using the URL address http://www.novelis.com or such other address as the
Company may from time to time designate in writing to the Trustee. In addition, the Company has agreed that, for
so long as any Notes remain outstanding, it will furnish to holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors,
upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to furnish any information required by Item 3-10
or 3-16 of Regulation S-X, it being understood that the Company will provide information with respect to its
Subsidiaries consistent with such information included in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, such reports will
not be subject to the TIA.

If at any subsequent time any direct or indirect parent company of the Company becomes a guarantor of
the Notes (there being no obligation of such parent to do so), the reports, information and other documents required
to be furnished to the holders pursuant to this covenant may, at the option of the Company, be furnished by and be
those of such parent rather than the Company; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information
that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand,
and the information relating to the Company, as applicable, and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on
the other hand.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report set forth in clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will also make available copies of such reports to The International Stock
Exchange Authority Limited (to the extent required by the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority
Limited).


-----

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any failure to comply with this covenant shall be
automatically cured when the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company, as the case may be,
furnishes all required reports to the holders of the Notes or files all required reports with the SEC.

**Statement as to Compliance**

The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee no later than the date on which the Company is required to deliver
annual reports pursuant to the covenant described under “—Reports and Other Information” above, an Officer’s
Certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the relevant officers of their respective duties as an officer
of the Issuer they would normally have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default and whether or not such
officers know of any Default that occurred during such period and, if any, specifying such Default or Event of
Default, its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

**Events of Default**

Events of Default in respect of the Notes are limited to:

(1) failure to make the payment of any interest on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable,
and such failure continues for a period of 30 days;

(2) failure to make the payment of any principal of, or premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on,
any of the Notes when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon acceleration, redemption,
optional redemption, required repurchase or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply with the covenant described under “—Reports and Other Information”, and such
failure continues for 120 days after written notice is given to the Issuer as provided below:

(4) failure to comply with any other covenant or agreement in the Notes or in the Indenture (other
than a failure that is the subject of the foregoing clause (1), (2) or (3)), and such failure continues for 60 days
after written notice is given to the Issuer as provided below;

(5) a default under any Debt by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that results in acceleration
of the maturity of such Debt, or failure to pay any such Debt at maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than
$150.0 million, _provided, that such default shall not be considered a Default (and the Notes shall not be_
accelerated) to the extent that the lenders, holders or trustee, as applicable, of such Debt have rescinded,
nullified or voided the acceleration of the maturity of such Debt prior to an acceleration of the Notes (the “cross
_acceleration provisions”);_

(6) any judgment or judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $150.0
million that shall be rendered against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and that shall not be waived,
satisfied or discharged for any period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement shall not be
in effect (the “judgment default provisions”);

(7) certain events involving bankruptcy, arrangement, insolvency or reorganization of the Company
or any Significant Subsidiary (including under any proceeding under applicable corporate law seeking a
compromise or arrangement of or stay of proceedings to enforce some or all of the debts of the Company or
such Significant Subsidiary, the “bankruptcy provisions”); and

(8) (a) the Parent Guaranty relating to the Notes ceasing to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of the Parent Guaranty) or the Parent Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under the Parent Guaranty relating to the Notes, or (b) any Subsidiary Guaranty of a Significant
Subsidiary ceasing to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Subsidiary
Guaranty) or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty (the “guaranty provisions”).

A Default under clause (3) or clause (4) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of not
less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding notify the Issuer in writing by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time


-----

specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state
that such notice is a “Notice of Default.”

Upon an Officer becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes, unless the
Default or Event of Default has been cured, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee within 10 days of becoming so
aware, written notice in the form of an Officers’ Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default, its status,
and the action the Issuer proposes to take with respect thereto.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes (other than an Event of Default resulting from certain
events involving bankruptcy, arrangement, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company or the Issuer)
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee or the registered holders of not less than 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may (or the Trustee shall upon the written request of the registered
holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) declare to be immediately
due and payable the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but
excluding the date of acceleration. In case an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy,
arrangement, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Issuer shall occur, such amount with respect to all the
Notes shall be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the
holders of the Notes. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration is obtained
by the Trustee, the registered holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other
than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, premium, Additional Amounts or interest, have been cured or waived
as provided in the Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the Notes, unless such holders shall have offered to
the Trustee reasonable indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee.
Subject to such provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee, the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee
with respect to the Notes. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by
written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of
Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default: (a) in the payment
of the principal, premium, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Notes, and (b) in respect of a covenant or
provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note
affected thereby.

No holder of the Notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for
the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy thereunder, unless:

(a) such holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of
Default;

(b) the registered holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding have made a written request and offered reasonable indemnity and/or security (including by
way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee; and

(c) the Trustee shall not have received from the registered holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding a written direction inconsistent with such request
and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days.

However, such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by a holder of any Note for enforcement of
payment of the principal of, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest, on such Note on or after the
respective due dates expressed in such Note.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and
reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default, and any time period in the


-----

Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction. In addition, any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to
provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by
any one or more holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each
such holder to the Company and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee, that
such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”),
which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated
at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In
addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the
Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify
the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a
“Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification
Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of its nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee evidence stating that the Company has filed papers
with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in
breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a
final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery
of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to
any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending
satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such holder, the
percentage of Notes held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with
the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred and the Trustee shall be deemed to
have not received the Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Event of Default.

The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default with respect to the
Notes unless either (1) with respect to any payment default a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge of such Default or Event of Default or (2) a written notice of such Default or Event of Default shall have
been given to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or member of the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Company (including the Issuer), as such, will have any liability for any obligations under the Notes,
the Indenture or the Guaranties, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer and the Trustee with the consent of the registered holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes) may amend the
Indenture and the Notes, and the registered holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
outstanding may waive any past Default or compliance with any provisions of the Indenture and the Notes (except
a Default in the payment of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest, if any, and the covenants
and provisions of the Indenture that are described in the next sentence which cannot be amended without the consent
of each holder of an outstanding Note). However, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note, no
amendment may, among other things,


-----

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement
or waiver;

(2) reduce the rate of, or extend the time for payment of, interest on, any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any Note;

(4) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium and Additional
Amounts, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the
rights of holders of such Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, premium or Additional Amounts,
on such Notes;

(7) subordinate the Notes, the Parent Guaranty or any Subsidiary Guaranty to any other obligation of
the Company, the Parent Guarantor or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable;

(8) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any
Note may be redeemed, as described under “—Optional Redemption” (excluding any amendment to shorten
the minimum notice period required for any redemption, which shall require the consent of holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding);

(9) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, make any change in any Guaranty of the Company
or of any Subsidiary Guarantor in any manner that would materially adversely affect the holders of the Notes;

(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions; or

(11) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture of any holder of the Notes to
receive payment of principal of, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on, such holder’s Notes
on or after the respective Stated Maturity for such principal or interest payment date for such interest expressed
in the Notes, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective Stated
Maturity or interest payment date.

The Indenture and the Notes may be amended by the Issuer and the Trustee without the consent of any
holder of the Notes to:

(12) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;

(13) provide for the assumption by a Surviving Person of the obligations of the Company or the Issuer
under the Indenture;

(14) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(15) add additional Guarantees with respect to the Notes or release Subsidiary Guarantors from
Subsidiary Guaranties as provided or permitted by the terms of the Indenture;

(16) secure the Notes, add to the covenants of the Company or the Subsidiary Obligors for the benefit
of the holders of such Notes or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or the Subsidiary
Obligors;

(17) make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Notes;

(18) evidence or provide for a successor Trustee;


-----

(19) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture;

(20) conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties to any provision of this “Description
of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” is intended to be a verbatim
recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties;

(21) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes; _provided, that (A) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being_
transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (B) such amendment
does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes;

(22) comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture
under the TIA; or

(23) add customary provisions or make any amendments to allow for the issuance of Additional Notes
into escrow.

The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment, supplement or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment, supplement or waiver. After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, the Issuer is
required to mail or deliver electronically to each registered holder of the Notes at such holder’s address appearing
in the security register a notice briefly describing such amendment, supplement or waiver. However, the failure to
give such notice to all holders of the Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the
amendment, supplement or waiver.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under, “—Optional
Redemption,” “—Change of Control Offer” or “—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the
covenants in effect at the time of such action, shall be deemed to impair or affect any legal rights of any holders of
the Notes to receive payment of principal of or premium or Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on the Notes or
to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s Notes.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, terminate all its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations
to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and to maintain
a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes. The Issuer at any time also may terminate:

(1) its obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control Offer” and “—Certain
_Covenants,”_

(2) the operation of the cross acceleration provisions, the judgment default provisions, the bankruptcy
provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries and the guaranty provisions, in each case described under
“—Events of Default” above, and

(3) the limitations contained in clause (d) under the first paragraph of, and in the third paragraph of,
“—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Property” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant
defeasance option.

If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of
an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) (with respect only
to Significant Subsidiaries) or (8) under “—Events of Default” above or because of the failure of the Issuer to comply
with clause (d) under the first paragraph of, or with the third paragraph of, “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of
_Property” above. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, any collateral_


-----

then securing the Notes will be released and each Guarantor will be released from all its obligations under its
Guaranty.

The legal defeasance option or the covenant defeasance option may be exercised only if:

(a) the Issuer irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee money or in euro or eurodenominated European Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, premium and Additional
Amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be; provided that
upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to
the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the
date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited
with the Trustee on or prior to the redemption date; provided further that any Applicable Premium Deficit
shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such
Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward
such redemption;

(b) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a certificate from an Independent Financial Advisor
expressing their opinion that the payments of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and
interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited European Government Obligations plus any
deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be
sufficient to pay principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest when due on all the Notes
to be defeased to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

The Issuer may discharge the Indenture such that it will cease to be of further effect, subject to certain
exceptions, as to all outstanding Notes when:

(1) either

(a) all the Notes previously authenticated (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have
been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has previously been deposited in trust or
segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and is thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from the trust)
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

**Foreign Currency Equivalents**

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction or amount, the U.S.
dollar equivalent principal amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency will be the Dollar Equivalent
calculated on the date the Debt was Incurred or other transaction was entered into, or first committed, in the case of
committed but undrawn debt, _provided, that if any Permitted Refinancing Debt is Incurred to refinance Debt_
denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction will
be deemed not have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Permitted Refinancing Debt does not
exceed the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture,
no restriction or amount will be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Issuer will irrevocably appoint Corporation Service Company as its agent for service of process in any
suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture or the Notes brought in any federal or state court located in
New York City and that each of the parties submits to the jurisdiction thereof.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since most of the Company’s assets are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against it, including judgments with respect to the payment of any amounts due under the Parent
Guaranty may not be collectible within the United States.

The laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein permit an action to
be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Ontario (an “Ontario Court”) for the enforcement
of the Parent Guaranty. An Ontario Court would recognize a judgment based upon a final and conclusive in
personam judgment of any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the City of New York (a “New
_York Court”) for a sum certain, obtained against the Company with respect to a claim arising out of the Parent_
Guaranty (a “New York Judgment”), and would enforce such judgment in an action by a judgment creditor (for
example, the Trustee) to enforce such judgment without reconsideration of the merits, (A) provided, that, (i) an
action to enforce the New York Judgment must be commenced in the Ontario Court within any applicable limitation
period; (ii) the Ontario Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the New York Judgment if the
New York Judgment is under appeal or there is another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction relating to the same
cause of action as the New York Judgment; (iii) the Ontario Court will render judgment only in Canadian dollars;
(iv) an action in the Ontario Court on the New York Judgment may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally; and (v) the Ontario Court must find that the
New York Court had jurisdiction over the Parent as recognized under the laws of Ontario; and (B) subject to the
following defenses, (w) the New York Judgment was obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to the principles of
natural justice; (x) the New York Judgment is for a claim which under Ontario law would be characterized as based
on a foreign revenue, expropriatory or penal law; (y) the New York Judgment is contrary to Ontario public policy;
and (z) the New York Judgment has been satisfied or is void or voidable under the internal laws of the State of New
York.

In addition, under the Currency Act (Canada), an Ontario Court may only render judgment for a sum of
money in Canadian currency, and in enforcing a foreign judgment for a sum of money in a foreign currency, an
Ontario court will render its decisions in the Canadian currency equivalent of such foreign currency, calculated at
the rate of exchange determined in accordance with the Courts of Justice Act (Ontario), which rate of exchange may
be the rate in existence on a day other than the day on which final judgment is given. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and the Offering—Fraudulent conveyance laws and other legal doctrines may permit courts to_
_void or subordinate the notes or the guarantees of the notes in specific circumstances, which would prevent or limit_
_payment under the notes or the guarantees. Certain limitations contained in the guarantees, which are designed to_
_avoid this result, may render the guarantees worthless.”_

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

**The Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is the Trustee under the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which written
notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the
Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise under the
circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless


-----

such holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory
to it against any loss, liability or expense. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to
the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the
provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for the holders of the Notes to take action directly.

The Issuer and the Guarantors jointly and severally will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities
and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection
with its duties.

had been realized on the first day of the relevant period), net of the amount of actual benefits realized from such
actions (it being understood that “run rate” shall mean the full reasonably expected recurring benefit that is
associated with the relevant action); provided that (1)(A) such Expected Cost Savings are factually supportable (or

Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a
participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge BookEntry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, “holders” of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered
the owners or “holders” of notes for any purpose. So long as the notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the holders of Global Notes for all
purposes under the indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which
they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the indenture.

Neither we nor the trustee under the indenture nor any of our respective agents will have any responsibility
or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests. None of the Issuer, the guarantors, the
trustee, the paying agent, the transfer agent or the registrar will have any responsibility, or be liable for any aspect of
the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**_Redemption of global notes_**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable,
will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof). We understand that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the
notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €1,000, principal amount at maturity, or less,
may be redeemed in part.


-----

**_Payments on global notes_**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, interest and premium, if any)
will be made by us to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary
or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with
their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the indenture, we and the trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e.,
Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments
and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the trustee or any of our respective agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or
payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream
or any participant or indirect participants, or for maintaining supervising or reviewing the records of
Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of
a Book-Entry Interest; or

  - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or the records of the common depositary.
Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street
name.”

**_Action by owners of book-entry interests_**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such
participant or participants has or have given such direction.

Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking
of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, each of
Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated
form, and to distribute such definitive registered notes to their respective participants.

**_Transfers_**

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of Rule
144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times be
subject to such restrictions. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of
a written certification (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the notes, ownership
of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or
persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons
shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A. Regulation S
Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within
the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws
of any other jurisdiction.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in


-----

one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the firstmentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter
be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other
Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest. Definitive registered notes may be transferred and
exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of the Notes— Transfer
_and exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form_
provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Definitive registered notes_**

Under the terms of the indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered notes
only:

  - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a
successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

  - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests an exchange in writing of its Book-Entry Interests for definitive
registered Notes following a default or event of default under the indenture.

In all cases, definitive registered notes will be maintained in registered form under Treasury Regulations section
5f.103-1(c), and may be transferred only in accordance with such provisions.

**_Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may
be changed at any time. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants.
Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface
with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.

Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and
trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act
on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners
of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A
Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**_Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system_**

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Exchange and admitted for trading
on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized stock exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes


-----

between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their
respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified
at any time. None of the Issuer, the Parent, the guarantors, the initial purchasers, the trustee, paying agent, the registrar
or transfer agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the notes will be in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody account of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day
following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in sameday funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be
made on the desired value date.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**CERTAIN FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may
be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances
that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as
applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or
retrospective effect.

The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate (“flat tax regime”) for certain investment income
and, in particular, interest income on the part of German tax resident private investors. By law of December 12, 2019
(Gesetz zur Rückführung des Solidaritätszuschlags 1995) the German legislator has decided on a partial repeal of the
solidarity surcharge starting as of the year 2021, which shall effectively benefit lower and middle income individual
taxpayers. However, the solidarity surcharge remains in place for purposes of the withholding tax, the flat tax regime
and the corporate income tax.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes, including the effect of any state, local or church taxes, under
the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are resident or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

**_Withholding Tax_**

_Tax Residents_

Ongoing payments, such as interest payments, received by an individual Holder of the Notes who is a German
tax resident (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management is located
in Germany) will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are kept or administered in
a custodial account with a German financial institution (i.e., a bank, a financial services institution, a securities trading
company or a securities trading bank (each, a “Disbursing Agent”, auszahlende Stelle)). The term German financial
institution includes a German branch of a foreign financial institution but not a foreign branch of a German financial
institution. The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding
being 26.375% (plus church tax, if applicable)). If the individual Holder is subject to church tax, a church tax surcharge
will also be withheld. The church tax surcharge is automatically withheld by the Disbursing Agent, unless the Holder
notifies the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) that it objects to automatic withholding. In the
case of such a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk), the Holder will be assessed to church tax (if applicable).

The same treatment applies to capital gains _(i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,_
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest”, Stückzinsen)
derived by an individual Holder irrespective of any holding period provided the Notes have been held in a custodial
account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest claims are disposed of separately
(i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds
from the redemption or collection of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since
the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate
of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if
applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (including Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent
has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by
a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or
certain other countries, _e.g., Switzerland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the_
Principality of Monaco and the Principality of Andorra (further details in case of a withholding tax of from 30% of
the disposal proceeds, see under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital—Tax Residents”).

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual Holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent
(e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct
Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the


-----

Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit
foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding other securities held by the individual
Holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual Holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent,
the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 jointly assessed
Holders) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross payment to be made by the
Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the Holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing
Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent tax office.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate Holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial partnership,
as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has
been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are
generally subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same
applies where the Notes form part of a German trade or business (of an individual or a commercial partnership) subject
to the filing of a respective application and further requirements being met.

_Non-Tax Residents_

Interest and capital gains received on the Notes by non-tax residents of Germany are, in general, not subject
to German withholding tax or the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject
to German taxation (as set forth under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non Tax Residents”) and
the Notes are held in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain
circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable double
taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection _“Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose_
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management is located in Germany).

Income _(i.e., interest and capital gains) derived under the Notes held by an individual Holder who is tax_
resident in Germany, irrespective of any holding period, is in general subject to German income tax at a flat tax rate
of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as
private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual Holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum
annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of **€801 (€1,602 for jointly assessed Holders), whereby actually incurred**
higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual Holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld. To the extent withholding tax
has not been levied, such as in the case no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process, the individual
Holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his or her tax return and will then
also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). If the withholding
tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather
than from the actual gain), an individual Holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal
proceeds, must declare the actual gain on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs in his or her respective income
tax return. Further, an individual Holder may apply for a tax assessment on the basis of general rules applicable to
him or her if the resulting individual income tax burden is lower than 25% with any amounts of German tax overwithheld being refunded. The deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted.
Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual Holder realized
in the same or following tax assessment periods. Further limitations to the offsetting of losses may apply under certain
circumstances. Losses arising from (i) a full or partial debt default (Uneinbringlichkeit einer Kapitalforderung), (ii) a
write-off of worthless assets (Ausbuchung wertloser Wirtschaftsgüter) (iii) a transfer of a worthless asset to a thirdparty, or (iv) any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an
amount of €20,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of €20.000 can be carried forward and might be
usable in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period), in each following
year up to a respective amount of €20.000.


-----

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate Holder, the withholding tax, if
any, will not settle the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or
corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Where Notes form part of
a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The
respective Holder will have to include income and related (business) expenses in the tax return and the balance will
be taxed at the Holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against
the personal or corporate income tax liability of the Holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate
income tax liability, will be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and
capital gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German
trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz).
If the Holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or
partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management is not located in Germany).

Interest, including Accrued Interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by Holders who are not tax resident in
Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a
permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the Holder
or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income from capital investments directly or
indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the
meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibung)) or income from profit participating instruments). Furthermore, the Holders who are not
tax resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of
an over-the-counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same
German Disbursing Agent. To the extent the German source income is subject to German withholding tax, this
withholding tax is, in general final and the German tax liability is satisfied by the tax withheld. Where the German
source income is not subject to German withholding tax or in case Notes form part of the business property of a
German permanent establishment as described in this paragraph above, a tax regime similar to that explained above
under “Tax Residents” applies. Subject to certain requirements, a Holder who is not tax resident in Germany may
benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided under an applicable double taxation treaty
(Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) and German tax law.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift tax
if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed to be
a resident of Germany or in certain cases for German citizens who previously maintained a residence in Germany. If
neither the Holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no
German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless (i) the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for
which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii)
the obligations under the Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (unless the Notes qualify
as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)).

Should a double tax treaty be applicable in the individual case, however, German taxation provisions may be
restricted thereby.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any notarial fees). However, under
certain conditions, entrepreneurs (for VAT purposes) may opt for a liability to value added tax with regard to the sale
of Notes which would otherwise be tax exempt. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.


-----

**_The proposed financial transactions tax_**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to introduce
a financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial intermediary).
The timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek
their own professional advice in relation to the financial transaction tax.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and
disposing of the notes generally applicable to U.S. Holders (as defined below). This summary is intended for general
information purposes only and does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant
to you in light of your particular investment or other circumstances. This summary applies to you only if you are a
U.S. Holder (as defined below) who acquires a note for cash in this offering for the price equal to its “issue price”
(i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to investors, other than to bond houses,
brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers),
and you hold the note as a capital asset (generally, investment property).

This summary does not address special U.S. federal income tax rules that may be applicable to certain
categories of beneficial owners of notes, such as:

      - dealers in securities or currencies;

      - traders in securities;

      - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

      - persons holding notes as part of a conversion, constructive sale, wash sale or other integrated
transaction or a hedge, straddle or synthetic security;

      - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;

      - certain U.S. expatriates;

      - banks or other financial institutions;

      - insurance companies;

      - controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
and regulated investment companies and shareholders of such corporations;

      - entities that are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and retirement plans, individual
retirement accounts and tax-deferred accounts;

      - pass-through entities, including S corporations and entities or arrangements classified as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and beneficial owners of pass-through entities;

      - entities covered by anti-inversion rules;

      - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect
to the notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement; and

      - persons that acquire the notes for a price other than their issue price.


-----

In addition, this summary only addresses U.S. federal income tax consequences, and does not address other
U.S. federal tax consequences, including, for example, estate or gift tax consequences or the Medicare tax on certain
investment income. This summary also does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. income or other tax
consequences.

If an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the
U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner, the
activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Entities or arrangements classified
as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and partners in such partnerships should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of notes.

This summary is based on U.S. federal income tax law, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial authority, and the tax treaty between
the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, all as in effect or in existence as of the date of this offering
memorandum. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing
interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of notes as set forth in this summary. We cannot assure you that
the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described in this
summary (or that a court will not sustain such a challenge), and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, any
ruling from the IRS or opinion of counsel with respect to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or
disposition of the notes. Before you purchase notes, you should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular
U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of
the notes that may be applicable to you.

For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a note that is for U.S. federal income
tax purposes:

      - a citizen or an individual who is a resident of the United States;

      - a corporation created or organized in, or under the laws of, the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia;

      - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of the source of
that income; or

      - a trust, if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and
one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) has the authority to control
all of the trust’s substantial decisions, or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable
Treasury regulations to be treated as a “United States person.”

**_Payments of Interest_**

Payments of interest on your notes and any additional amounts paid in respect of income taxes withheld from
interest payments on the notes (as described in “Description of the Notes — Payment of Additional Amounts”) will be
included in your gross income and taxed as ordinary interest income at the time such payments are accrued or received
in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this discussion,
references to interest include additional amounts.

The amount of interest income included in your gross income will include the amount of all German taxes
that we withhold (as described above under “—Certain Federal Republic of Germany Tax Considerations”) from
these payments made on the notes. Thus, if German income tax is withheld from payments to you on the notes, you
will have to include in your gross income an amount of interest income that is greater than the amount of cash that
you receive from these payments. If you are subject to German withholding taxes, you should consult your own tax
advisors regarding the availability of relief from withholding or a refund of any withheld taxes under the tax treaty
between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.


-----

You may, subject to certain limitations, be eligible to claim any German income taxes withheld from interest
payments as a credit for purposes of computing your U.S. federal income tax liability. Interest and additional amounts
paid on the notes will constitute income from non-U.S. sources for foreign tax credit purposes. Such income generally
will constitute “passive category income” or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, “general category income”, for
foreign tax credit purposes. If a refund of any tax withheld is available under an applicable income tax treaty, the
amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability. The rules relating to the calculation and timing of foreign tax credits are complex and their
application depends upon a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. In addition, foreign tax credits generally will not
be allowed for German taxes withheld from interest on certain short-term or hedged positions in the notes. You should
consult your own tax advisors with regard to the availability of a credit in respect of foreign taxes and, in particular,
the application of the foreign tax credit rules to your particular situation. As an alternative to claiming the foreign tax
credit, you may elect to deduct foreign taxes. If you so elect, the election will apply to all of your foreign taxes for
that tax year. You should consult your own tax advisors with regard to the election to deduct foreign taxes.

It is expected, and this summary assumes, that the notes will not be issued with original issue discount (“OID”)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If, however, the notes are issued with OID, the U.S. federal income tax
consequences to a U.S. Holder of owning and disposing of the notes could differ materially from those described in
this summary.

**_Foreign Currency Considerations with Respect to Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the notes will be denominated in euro, and the amount of income that you will
be required to include in respect of stated interest payments on your notes will depend on your method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a cash basis U.S. Holder, you will be required to include in income
the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount of interest received (including amounts received upon the disposition of a
note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the spot
exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars
on such date. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize any foreign currency gain or loss on receipt of a
euro interest payment.

If you are an accrual basis U.S. Holder, you will be required to accrue interest income on your note in euro
and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest
accrual period (or portion thereof within your taxable year). As an alternative, if you are an accrual basis U.S. Holder,
you may elect to accrue interest income at the spot exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or the
spot exchange rate in effect on the last day of your taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans
more than one taxable year) or at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date the interest payment is received if such
date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period
within your taxable year if the accrual period spans more than one taxable year). If you make this election to accrue
interest income at the spot exchange rate, you must apply the election consistently to all debt instruments held by you
from year to year and you cannot change the election without the consent of the IRS.

If you are an accrual basis U.S. Holder, upon receipt of a euro interest payment (including amounts received
upon the disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), you will be required to recognize foreign
currency gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference (if any) between (i) the U.S. dollar value of such payment
determined by translating the payment at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date such payment of interest (or
disposition proceeds attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) is received and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the interest
income that you previously accrued with respect to such payment of interest (or accrued interest), regardless of
whether the payment is actually converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. Foreign currency gain or loss will
be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally as U.S. source income or loss. Foreign currency gain or loss with
respect to payments of interest generally will not be treated as interest income or expense.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, redemption, retirement, exchange or other taxable disposition (each a “disposition”) of your
notes, except as noted below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, you generally will recognize
capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between:


-----

      - your amount realized on the disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated
interest on such notes); and

      - your adjusted tax basis in such notes, which generally will be their cost.

Any amount realized on the disposition that is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest will be taxable
as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in your gross income in the manner described above
under “—Payments of Interest”. Any capital gain or loss recognized on the disposition will be long-term capital gain
or loss if, at the time of the disposition, you have held the notes for more than one year. If you are a non-corporate
U.S. Holder, under current law your long-term capital gain generally is subject to a preferential rate of U.S. federal
income tax. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Foreign Currency Considerations with Respect to Disposition of Notes**

If you are a cash basis U.S. Holder and you receive euro on the disposition of a note, your amount realized
generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received (other than amounts received upon the disposition of a note
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), calculated at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the disposition.
However, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, you will be required to determine the U.S. dollar
amount realized by translating the euro received at the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the
disposition.

If you are an accrual basis U.S. Holder and you receive euro on the disposition of a note, your amount realized
generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount received (other than amounts received upon the disposition
of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), calculated at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the
disposition. As an alternative, if you are an accrual basis U.S. Holder and the notes are traded on an established
securities market, you may elect to determine the U.S. dollar amount realized by translating the euro received (other
than amounts received upon the disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) at the spot exchange
rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If you make this election you must apply such election
consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year and you cannot change the election without the
consent of the IRS.

In any case where the amount realized is based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the
disposition, you generally will be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference (if any)
between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount realized based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of
the disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount realized based on the spot exchange rate in effect on
the settlement date.

If you pay the purchase price for a note in euro, your tax basis in the note generally will be the U.S. dollar
value of the euro purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot exchange rate in effect on such date.

You will be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss (if any) attributable to a change in exchange
rates between the date of your purchase of a note and the date of your disposition of the note. Gain or loss attributable
to a change in exchange rates will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of your euro purchase price
for the note determined based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date that the note is disposed of (or possibly,
if the notes are traded on an established securities market, in the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual
basis U.S. Holder, at the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition) and (ii) the U.S. dollar
value of your euro purchase price for the note determined based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date that
you acquired the note. The realization of foreign currency gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued interest,
in the aggregate, will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the note. Foreign
currency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally U.S. source income or loss. Foreign
currency gain or loss on a disposition of notes generally will not be treated as interest income or expense.


-----

**Foreign Currency Gain or Loss with Respect to Euro**

If you purchase a note with previously owned euro, you will be required to recognize foreign currency gain
or loss at the time of purchase attributable to the difference at the time of purchase (if any) between your tax basis in
such euro and the fair market value of the note in U.S. dollars on the date of your exchange of euro for such note.

Your tax basis in euro received as interest on, or on the disposition of, a note will be the U.S. dollar value
thereof determined at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date you received the euro.

Upon any subsequent conversion or other disposition of the euro for U.S. dollars, you generally will be
required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference (if any) between the amount of U.S. dollars
that you receive and your tax basis in the euro.

In the event that your gain from the disposition of a note is subject to withholding of German income tax (see
“–Certain Federal Republic of Germany Tax Considerations”), your amount realized will include the gross amount
of the proceeds of that sale or other taxable disposition before deduction of such income tax. If you are eligible for the
benefits of the tax treaty between the United States and the Republic of Germany, you may be able to elect to treat
such gain as from German sources for foreign tax credit purposes. Consequently, subject to a number of complex
limitations and conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement), you may be able to benefit from the
foreign tax credit for that German income tax. Otherwise, your capital gain or loss generally will be U.S. source gain
or loss for foreign tax credit purposes, and if your gain from the disposition of a note is subject to withholding of
German income tax you may not be able to benefit from the foreign tax credit for that income tax (i.e., because the
gain from the disposition would be U.S. source), unless you can apply the credit against U.S. federal income tax
payable on other income from non-U.S. sources. Alternatively, you may elect to take a deduction for the German
income tax, provided that you elect to deduct all foreign taxes paid or accrued for the taxable year. You should consult
your own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of a disposition of notes.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, information reporting requirements may apply to payments of stated interest on your notes and
the proceeds of a disposition of your the notes.

In general, “backup withholding” (currently at a rate of 24%) may apply to payments of stated interest on
your notes and the proceeds of a disposition of your notes, if you are a U.S. Holder and you fail to provide a correct
taxpayer identification number or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules and you do not otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability (which may result in your being entitled to a refund of
U.S. federal income tax), provided that the required information is timely provided to the IRS.

**Disclosure Requirements with Respect to Foreign Currency Loss Transactions**

Applicable Treasury regulations require a U.S. Holder to report certain transactions that give rise to a foreign
currency loss in excess of certain thresholds. Under these Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder that recognizes a foreign
currency loss with respect to the notes would be required to report the loss on IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement) if the loss exceeds the thresholds set forth in the Treasury regulations. Each U.S. Holder should
consult its own tax advisors regarding the application of the reportable transaction rules to their purchase, ownership
and disposition of the notes and the substantial penalties for noncompliance.

**Certain Additional Reporting Requirements**

Individual U.S. Holders (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, certain U.S. Holders
that are entities) that hold “specified foreign financial assets” whose aggregate value exceeds $75,000 at any time
during the taxable year or $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year (or such higher amounts as prescribed by


-----

applicable Treasury regulations) are required to file a report on IRS Form 8938 with information relating to the assets
for each such taxable year. Specified foreign financial assets (as defined in Section 6038D of the Code) would include,
among other things, the notes, unless the notes are held in an account maintained by a U.S. “financial institution” (as
defined in Section 6038D of the Code). Substantial penalties apply to any failure to timely file IRS Form 8938, unless
the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Additionally, in the event an individual
U.S. Holder (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder that is an entity) that is
required to file IRS Form 8938 does not file such form, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of
U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close until three years after the date that the
required information is filed. U.S. Holders (including U.S. entities) should consult their own tax advisors regarding
their reporting obligations with respect to specified foreign financial assets.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the notes are
subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the
notes if they purchase any of the notes. The purchase agreement also provides that if an initial purchaser defaults, the
purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may also be increased or the offering may be
terminated.

The initial purchasers propose to resell the notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this
offering memorandum within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance
on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The price at
which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the
notes through their affiliates. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify an order of the notes
in whole or in part.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and
may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in
Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
See “Transfer Restrictions.”


-----

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United
States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities
Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

We have agreed that, for a period of 30 days from the date of this offering memorandum, we will not, without
the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan AG and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., offer, sell or contract to sell, or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by
us. J.P. Morgan AG and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in their sole discretion may release any of the securities subject
to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice.

The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We cannot assure you
that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering
price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers
have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and
they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes.

We estimate that our portion of the total expenses of this offering will be $        .

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market.
Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing
purchases.

    - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than
they are required to purchase in the offering.

    - Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

    - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial
purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the
notes. They may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open
market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-thecounter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them
at any time.

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their
respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us
from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time
to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they
may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities,
the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans
and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold
long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve
securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. In addition, affiliates of some of the initial purchasers are lenders,
and in some cases agents or managers for the lenders, under our Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver. In particular,
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Axis Bank Limited, Singapore Branch, BofA Securities Europe,
BNP Paribas, Barclays Bank Ireland plc, Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG, Crédit Agricole Corporate and
Investment Bank, DBS Bank Ltd, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, HSBC Securities (USA)
Inc., ING Bank N.V., J.P. Morgan AG, MUFG Securities (Europe) N.V., Société Générale, Standard Chartered Bank,
SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Europe, Wells Fargo Securities Europe S.A., or their respective affiliates, are joint lead


-----

bookrunners and joint lead arrangers for one or more of the various facilities under our senior secured credit facilities
and certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders thereunder. Standard Chartered Bank acted as a
lender and as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Term Loan Facility. Additionally, an affiliate of one
of the initial purchasers is acting as trustee with respect to the notes.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge,
and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may hedge, their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would
include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the
notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of
the notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend
to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the initial
purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the 2017 Term Loans and as a result will receive proceeds
from the offering.

Axis Bank Limited and First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC. If an
initial purchaser is not a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, it may not make sales of any notes in the United States
or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, and will only do so through one or
more U.S. registered broker-dealers, or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law. If a jurisdiction requires that
the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and an initial purchaser or any affiliate of that initial purchaser is
a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by that initial purchaser or
such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer (as defined in this Offering Memorandum) in such jurisdiction. Australia and
New Zealand Banking Group Limited, ING Bank N.V. and Standard Chartered Bank will not effect any offers or sales
of any notes in the United States unless it is through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the
regulations of FINRA. Although DBS Bank Ltd. is not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, DBS Bank Ltd., as
a non-U.S. financial institution, may engage in a limited range of securities activities including underwriting and other
participation in offerings in the United States pursuant to exemptions from broker-dealer registration including those
set forth in Rule 15a-6 of the Exchange Act.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of those
liabilities.

**_European Economic Area_**

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor
in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making the notes available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only,
each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

(8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the notes

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency limitations and limitations on the validity and enforceability_
_of guarantees in Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, the United Arab Emirates_
_and Brazil. The following description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the notes and the guarantees._
_Prospective investors in the notes should consult their own legal advisers with respect to such limitations and_
_considerations._

**Canada**

**_Bankruptcy and Insolvency Laws_**

The rights of the trustee under the Parent Guaranty and the Canadian subsidiary guarantees to enforce
remedies could be significantly impaired by the restructuring provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy,
insolvency and other restructuring legislation (collectively, “Canadian Insolvency Legislation”) if the benefit of such
legislation is sought. For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and the Companies’ Creditors
Arrangement Act (Canada) (the “CCAA”) contain provisions enabling an insolvent person to obtain a stay of
proceedings against its creditors and others and to prepare and file a proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement,
as the case may be, to be voted on by the various classes of its affected creditors. A proposal or plan, if accepted by
the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors, and if approved by the relevant Canadian court, would be
binding on all creditors within each affected class whether or not such creditor voted to accept the proposal or the plan.
There is no certainty that previously accrued rights or interests of creditors, including the noteholders, will be enforced
by the Canadian court or included in any such proposal, plan or in a distribution order. The determination of how
claims will ultimately be treated, as well as how each class of affected claims will be settled, including payment terms,
if applicable, in restructuring proceedings cannot be made until the Canadian court has approved a proposal, plan or a
distribution order. There is no assurance that any such proposal or plan will be sanctioned by the Canadian court or
that any such proposal or plan will be implemented successfully. Moreover, in the context of a restructuring, Canadian
Insolvency Legislation permits the insolvent debtor to retain possession and administration of its property, subject to
court oversight, even though it may be in default under the applicable debt instrument during the period in which the
stay of proceedings remains in place.

The powers of the court under Canadian Insolvency Legislation and particularly under the CCAA, are
exercised broadly to protect an insolvent person or debtor and its estate from actions taken by creditors and others.
The Court has pervasive equity powers when applying this legislation and the exercise of judicial discretion may
depend on future-arising facts and the circumstances and the nature of insolvency proceedings, generally. Accordingly,
we cannot predict whether payments under the notes would be made during any proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency
or other restructuring proceeding, whether or when the trustee for the notes could exercise its rights under the notes
indentures or whether, and to what extent, holders of notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any,
of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the trustee for the notes. Typically, the stay of
proceedings would prevent payments from being made under the notes or the guarantees and the trustee from
exercising its rights while the insolvent company is under court protection.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under Canadian Insolvency Legislation and comparable provincial laws on preferences, fraudulent
conveyances, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transactions, the payment of money, disposition
of property, incurrence of an obligation, or provision of services to a creditor or other person can be challenged as a
preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction. The tests to
be applied under these Canadian laws vary, but as a general matter, these challenges may arise in circumstances where:

    - an entity is found to be insolvent at the time it issued a note or provided a guarantee;

    - an entity was rendered insolvent by issuing a note or providing a guarantee;


-----

    - a note was issued, or a guarantee was provided, within a specified period of time prior to the
commencement of proceedings under Canadian Insolvency Legislation and the consideration received by
the insolvent note issuer or guarantor was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the
consideration given by the note issuer or guarantor;

    - an insolvent note issuer or guarantor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor or such action was
taken with a view to giving such a creditor a preference;

    - holders of notes, or beneficiaries under guarantees, were not dealing at arm’s length with an insolvent
issuer or guarantor and the obligation incurred had the effect of giving such holders of notes, or
beneficiaries under guarantees, a preference; or

    - a note issuer or a guarantor is found to have acted in a manner that was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial
to, or unfairly disregarded the interests of, any shareholder, creditor, director, officer or other interested
party.

    - In general, a Canadian court would deem an entity insolvent if:

    - it is for any reason unable to meets its obligations as they generally become due;

    - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become
due; or

    - the aggregate of its property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted
sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all of its obligations, due and
accruing due.

Also, a Canadian court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or guarantees to other claims
against the issuer and/or guarantors if the court determines that:

    - the holder of notes or beneficiary of the guarantee engaged in some form of inequitable conduct;

    - the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon
the holders of the notes or beneficiaries of the guarantees; and

    - such subordination is not inconsistent with applicable laws.

A Canadian court may also impose substantive consolidation, or variants thereof, on the estates of insolvent
debtor companies forming part of the same corporate group (provided certain criteria are met), and this may impair
your ability to collect payment in full under the notes and the guarantees.

**_COVID-19 Crisis_**

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has not substantially altered the recourses and proceedings available
to debtors and creditors under Canadian Insolvency Legislation. Although the pandemic did lead to the temporary
extension of certain filing and procedural deadlines applicable to active cases, the courts that handle bankruptcy and
insolvency cases have relied on virtual hearings to continue their adjudication of urgent bankruptcy and insolvency
matters throughout the pandemic. The pervasive equity powers of Canadian courts applying insolvency and
bankruptcy laws and the potential relevance to the exercise of judicial discretion of future-arising facts and
circumstances will permit Canadian courts to continue to take into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
substantive and procedural matters related to such proceedings.

**European Union**

The guarantors incorporated in Ireland, France and Germany are incorporated under the laws of member
states of the European Union (each such state, a “Member State”).


-----

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015
(Recast of the Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), on insolvency proceedings, as amended (the
“EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the
Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used and defined in Article 3(1) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of
where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member
States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a
company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office, in the absence of
proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member
State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts
the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. The courts have taken
into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company which are at least
partially listed in the whereas of the EU Insolvency Regulation, including, in particular, where board meetings are
held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office, and the location
where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main interests” may
change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to
open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are public collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of
a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the
courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings
against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An
“establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month
period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means
and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets
of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State
in which the company has its centre of main interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State
in which the company has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. Where main proceedings in
the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency
proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment only where either (a)
insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is
situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a
creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory
of such Member State, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of such Member State has the right to request
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial
proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e.,
the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings
have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to
open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred
on him or her by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company
from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened
in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency
proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

**France**

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

Any guarantee provided by a French company will be subject to the following limitations:


-----

(A) the obligations and liabilities of a company incorporated in France (a “French Guarantor”)
under any guarantee or any security interest granted by it shall not include any obligation or liability which,
if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of article L. 225-216 of the
French Commercial Code and/or would constitute an infringement of the provisions of article L. 241-3, L.
242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code or any other law or regulations having the same effect, as
interpreted by French courts. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from
guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its
acquisition;

(B) should a guarantee be granted by a French Guarantor which is a subsidiary of the Issuer, a
guarantee limitation amount would apply corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering
of the notes applied by the Issuer for the direct or indirect benefit of that French Guarantor through any
intercompany loans and/or cash pooling arrangements to that French Guarantor or its subsidiaries and
outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made under the guarantee. Accordingly, the obligations
and liabilities of a French Guarantor under its guarantee shall be limited, at any time, to the proceeds of the
notes (if any) made available by the Issuer to such French Guarantor and/or any subsidiaries of such French
Guarantor (if any) under intercompany loan or cash pooling arrangements or similar arrangements, in each
case to the extent such loans are outstanding to the French Guarantor and/or its subsidiaries at the time when
a payment is required under the guarantee, it being specified that any payment made by a French company
under this guarantee shall automatically reduce _pro tanto_ the outstanding amount of the relevant
intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French company to the parent company or its
subsidiaries. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the guarantees could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively
no obligation under its guarantee; and

(C) the obligations and liabilities of a French company for the obligations of any obligor which
is its subsidiary will cover all amounts due by such obligor as borrower under any applicable finance
document and as obligor (the “Guaranteed Obligor”). However, where such Guaranteed Obligor is not
incorporated in France, the amounts payable by the French company under this paragraph (C) in respect of
the obligations of the Guaranteed Obligor as guarantor, shall be limited as set out in paragraph (B) above.

For the avoidance of doubt, any obligations or liabilities that may arise from a French company acting jointly
and severally with other guarantors (including, as applicable, as _co-débiteur solidaire) are subject always to the_
limitations set out in the preceding paragraphs.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less
than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis,
the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable
under certain circumstances.

French courts could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the
relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the
French Guarantor did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant
of the guarantee as a whole. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit as regards a French Guarantor and
whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French
case law provides no clear guidance.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third party obligations, the guarantee
must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. French case law has
recognized that certain intragroup transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the
relevant company, particularly if the following four criteria are fulfilled:

    - the existence of a genuine group of companies (taken as a whole, not just its shareholders) operating
under a common strategy aimed at a common objective;

    - the existence of a common economic, social or financial interests of the group within the framework of
a policy implemented by the group of companies;


-----

    - the transaction shall not be without due consideration and compensation and shall not change the existing
balance between the respective obligations of the relevant affiliates; and

    - the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit. The French Guarantor must
receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the
granting by it of the guarantee and the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee shall not
exceed its financial capability.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the French Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed
are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

**_Enforcement Of Civil Liabilities_**

The executive officers of the French Guarantors are, and will continue to be, non-residents of the United
States and such persons are located outside the United States. Although each of these French Guarantors has appointed
an agent for service of process in the United States, these French Guarantors and the Issuer have been advised that
there is a doubt that a foreign judgment based upon U.S. federal or state securities law would be enforced in France.
Such French Guarantors and the Issuer have also been advised that there is a doubt that a lawsuit based upon U.S.
federal or state securities law could be brought in an original action in France. The United States and France are not
party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards
rendered in commercial matters and, with respect to France, awards rendered in the United States civil matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S.
judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the
following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by
the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

    - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter as the dispute is clearly
connected to the jurisdiction of such courts, the choice of the U.S. courts is not fraudulent and the French
courts did not have exclusive jurisdictions over the matter;

    - the court that has rendered such judgment has applied a law that would have been considered as
applicable and/or appropriate under French rules of international conflicts of laws;

    - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case including the defense rights;

    - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and

    - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with French judgment or a foreign judgment which has become
effective in France and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement
of the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980 and Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of documents and
information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial, or technical nature to foreign authorities), which could
prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative
U.S. action. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files
and individual liberties, as modified several times and as last modified by law No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018) can
limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France and from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.


-----

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law
if its application contravenes French international public policy. Further, in an action brought in France on the basis
of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (Article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before
French courts (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national,
either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French
courts. However, according to recent case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer
mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contacts
with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, the claimant may waive its rights to
benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code.

**_French Insolvency Considerations_**

One guarantor is incorporated in France and may be subject to French laws governing creditors’ rights and
insolvency proceedings, including court assisted informal pre-insolvency proceedings (mandate ad hoc or conciliation
proceedings) and court administered insolvency proceedings (safeguard (sauvegarde), reorganization (redressement)
or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings). The following is a brief description of certain aspects of
insolvency law in France for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that
may be relevant to holders of the notes.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such
debtor’s or a third-party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other
legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the
creditors’ representative, the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan),
insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency
proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside
insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if:

    - the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so;

    - the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced
in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and

    - at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or
should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no
such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary).

If a court found the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any
defense under applicable law, then the granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties
or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such
successful challenges, holders of the notes may not enjoy the benefit of the guarantees and the value of any
consideration that holders of the notes received with respect to the notes could also be subject to recovery from the
holders of the notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the
notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the French Guarantor as
a result of the fraudulent conveyance.


-----

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, creditors can be subject to Articles 1343-5 et seq. of the
French Civil Code). Pursuant to these articles, French courts may, in any civil proceedings involving the debtor,
whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s
financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations over a maximum period of
two years and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest
at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate published annually by decree) or
that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal rather than interest. If a court order under
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code is made, it will automatically suspend any pending enforcement measures,
and any contractual interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the
court. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. When the debtor benefits from the opening of a conciliation
proceedings, these provisions shall be read in combination with Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see
below).

**_Warning Procedure (procédure d’alerte)_**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for several warning
procedures. Pursuant to Article L. 234-1 of the French Commercial Code, when there are elements which the statutory
auditors of a public limited company (société anonyme) believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in
jeopardy, a four step procedure must be followed:

      - the statutory auditors must request the management to provide an explanation of the company’s situation.
If the answer is satisfactory and the doubts are removed, the procedure stops there. If the auditor does
not receive a satisfactory response, the second step is taken.

      - Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures, the auditors can request that a board of director's
(or supervisory board) meeting be convened. We find the same mechanism: if the managers take
measures that seem sufficient to the auditor, the procedure stops there

      - If the statutory auditor is still not satisfied, a special general meeting of shareholders is held, at which
the auditor presents a report.

      - If the meeting does not take satisfactory measures, the statutory auditor shall inform the president of the
commercial court of his steps and of the fact that they have not been successful. The latter may then take
action himself.

      - In the other commercial companies (private limited company or SARL, société par action simplifiée or
_société en commandite par action), Article L. 234-2 of the French Commercial Code establishes an alert_
procedure in only three phases: informing the directors, convening a general meeting and informing the
president of the court.

The auditors also must inform the commercial court. Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital
and the workers’ committee of a company have similar rights. The commercial court can also itself summon the
management to provide explanations on elements which the court believes put the company’s existence as a going
concern in jeopardy. Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 611-2-1 of the French Commercial Code, the competent
civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) will also be able to exercise the emergency procedure for debtors submitted to its
jurisdiction.

**_Ad Hoc Agent (mandat ad hoc)_**

A company that is facing any type of difficulties (but which is still able to pay its debts as they fall due out
of its available assets) may request to the court the appointment of an ad hoc agent (mandataire ad hoc). The ad hoc
agent’s duties are determined by the court. Such ad hoc agents are usually appointed in order to facilitate the
negotiations with creditors, but they cannot coerce the creditors to accept any proposal. Creditors are not barred from
taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they usually accept not to. Mandat ad
_hoc proceedings are confidential and are not limited in time. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the_


-----

help of the ad hoc agent is reported by the latter to the court but is not sanctioned by the court. In any event, the debtor
retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set forth above.

Although not expressly mentioned in the provisions governing mandat ad hoc in the French Commercial
Code, mandat ad hoc proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of participating
creditors has been sought to prepare the disposal of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to implementing
such sale (plan de cession) in subsequent insolvency proceedings. To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must
be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such mandat ad hoc proceedings.

Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or
increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of an ad hoc agent or any request made to
this end are deemed null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of
_mandat ad hoc_ proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of creditors’ counsel relating to such proceedings are
deemed null and void with respect to the portion of such fees above a proportion fixed by order of the Minister of
Justice (currently: 75% of the fees).

**_Conciliation Proceedings_**

A company may, in its sole discretion, apply for the opening of conciliation proceedings (procédure de
_conciliation) with respect to itself, provided it (i) is able to pay its due debts out of its available assets, or has been_
unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets (en état de cessation des paiements) for less than 45 days and (ii)
experiences legal, economic or financial difficulties. If a competent court decides to grant the petition, it will appoint
a conciliator (conciliateur) to help the company reach an agreement with its creditors and/ or trade partners for
reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last up to five months.
This agreement may be either, upon all parties’ request, acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the court or,
upon the debtor’s request, approved (homologué) by the court.

The acknowledgement of the agreement by the president of the court gives the agreement the legal force of
a final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial title that can be enforced by the parties without further
recourse to a judge (titre exécutoire), although the conciliation proceedings will remain confidential.

The approval by the court, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, will disclose the existence
of conciliation proceedings, the guarantees and priorities (privilèges) granted to the creditors (but will not make public
the terms of the conciliation agreement) and will have the following specific consequences:

    - creditors who provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business
of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will enjoy a priority of
payment over all pre-proceedings and post-proceedings claims (other than certain employment claims
and post-proceedings procedural costs), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, accelerated
safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings
or judicial liquidation proceedings; and

    - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of the _cessation des paiements and therefore the commencement date of the “hardening” period_
(période suspecte) cannot be fixed by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval of the
conciliation agreement by the court (see below for the definition of the date of the _cessation des_
_paiements and of the “hardening” period), except in case of fraud; and_

    - in the event of subsequent Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, or
Judicial Reorganization proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the “new money
privilege” may not be rescheduled without their holders’ consent.

When acknowledging or approving the conciliation agreement, the president of the court or the court may
appoint, upon request of the debtor, the conciliator as _mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord_ to supervise the
performance of the agreement for the period corresponding to the duration of this conciliation agreement.


-----

Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract by diminishing the rights or increasing
the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the opening of conciliation proceedings or any request made to this
end are deemed null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of
_conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of creditors’ counsel relating to such proceedings are deemed_
null and void with respect to the portion of such fees above a proportion fixed by order of the Minister of Justice
(currently: seventy-five percent of the fees). While the conciliation agreement (whether acknowledged or approved)
is being implemented, by law: (i) any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims governed by the
conciliation agreement are suspended, (ii) accrued interests of the claims governed by the conciliation agreement
cannot bear themselves interests and (iii) the debtor retains the right to petition the President of the Court who opened
conciliation proceedings for debt rescheduling (pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code mentioned above)
in relation to creditors (other than public creditors) who were called to the conciliation with respect to their claims
which are not governed by the conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard
the mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord appointed to supervise the performance of the restructuring agreement, if the
conciliator has been appointed in such capacity and taking into account the actual performance of the restructuring
agreement by the debtor.

A third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle) can benefit
from the grace periods granted to the debtor during conciliation proceedings as well as from the provisions of the
approved or acknowledged agreement (Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code).

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for
its termination. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, to the exception of
those amounts already paid to them.

Conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of participating
creditors has been sought to prepare the disposal of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to implementing
such sale (plan de cession) in subsequent insolvency proceedings. To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must
be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such conciliation proceedings.

Finally, conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported
by a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the thresholds required for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will
be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings, as described below.

**_Safeguard Proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde)_**

The safeguard proceedings allow for the establishment of a restructuring plan negotiated with the creditors
under court supervision before the company becomes insolvent. It is available only at the request of a debtor company.
The objectives of safeguard proceedings are to facilitate the debtor’s reorganization in order to safeguard the debtor’s
activity and employment and to pay creditors. The debtor must be solvent (i.e., not unable to pay its due debts out of
its available assets) (absence d’état de cessation des paiements) but experiencing difficulties that it cannot overcome.
Safeguard proceedings are public and include an automatic stay of all actions against the debtor for up to six months,
renewable for an additional six months with court approval and which can be extended, under exceptional
circumstances, to a maximum of 18 months upon request of the public prosecutor.

During that observation period, which may last up to 18 months, a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire), whose name can be suggested by the debtor, investigates the business of the company and
helps the company to elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde).

During the safeguard proceedings, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the opening of the
proceedings are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The bankruptcy judge can authorize payments for prior debts
in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or recover goods or rights
transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts arising after the commencement of the
safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’s ordinary activities or are required by
the proceedings must be paid as and when they fall due, and if such is not the case, they will be given priority over
debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings.


-----

One of the main features of the safeguard proceedings consists in the creation of two creditors’ committees
(mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding €20 million, and whose
accounts are certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a certified public accountant
(expert comptable), optional below such thresholds), one of banks and financial institutions (or assimilated institutions
and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor) and the other of suppliers having a claim that
represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers, as well as a general meeting
of note holders (comprising all holders of all notes or bonds issued by the company even if they relate to different
issues and regardless of the law applicable to each issue), in the event the concerned debtor would have issued bonds
or notes, to which the debtor submits proposals to reach agreement on a recovery plan.

The debtor’s management, together with the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of drafting the plan
which will be voted by the committee(s) and the general meeting of noteholders as the case may be. Additionally,
each member of the credit institutions’ committee and each member of the suppliers’ committee may propose an
alternative safeguard or reorganization plan, which will have to obtain the support of all committees and general
meeting of noteholders, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, the noteholders are not entitled to propose such a plan.

The committees must accept or reject proposals for a safeguard plan within a minimum of 15 days of having
received such proposals. For each committee, the plan is approved by such committee, where the members voting in
favor of the plan account for at least two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the committee members expressing a vote.
The amounts of the claims secured by a trust (fiducie) constituted as a guarantee granted by the debtor are not taken
into account. In addition, creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of their repayment schedule
or provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are
admitted, do not take part in the vote.

In cases where bonds or notes have been issued by the relevant French company, the plan, if approved by the
committees, is then submitted to the general meeting of note holders where it is also approved by a majority of twothirds of the outstanding claims of the note holders expressing a vote.

In respect of voting rights in both committees and general meeting of note holders, each creditor member of
a creditors’ committee and each note holder must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the
existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its vote or providing for the full or partial payment of its claim
by a third party, as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to the
concerned creditor/note holder a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the relevant creditors’ committee
or general meeting of note holders. In the event of a disagreement, the concerned creditor/ note holder or the courtappointed administrator may request that the matter be decided by the president of the commercial court in summary
proceedings.

Those creditors whose repayment terms are not affected by the draft safeguard plan, or for which the draft
plan provides for full repayment in cash upon approval of the plan or admission of their claims, will not vote in the
framework of the creditors’ committees or the general meeting of noteholders, as applicable. The committees and the
general meeting of note holders, if any, must vote on the plan within six months from the date of the judgment opening
the proceedings. If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved within these six months, this six-month period may be
extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the
observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. The plan
submitted to the committees and the note holders, if any, may include not only a rescheduling of debts but also
cancellation of debts and debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). In
that respect it should be noted that (i) if the plan provides for a capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to
such share capital increase by way of a set-off with their claims against the debtor, as reduced as the case may be
according to the provisions of the plan, (ii) if the court empowers the court-appointed administrator to convene a
shareholders’ meeting in order to take corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s by-laws
(including modifications of its share capital) required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain
conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as
long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights.

The plan may provide for a different treatment of creditors if the differences in their situation so justify. The
plan submitted to the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders must take into account intercreditor
subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings.


-----

Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of note holders, if any, and subject
to verification by the court that creditors’ interests are adequately preserved, the court can approve the plan, in which
case the plan will be binding on all creditors and noteholders (including those who did not vote or who voted against
the adoption of the plan). Creditors who are not members of committees and who are not noteholders are consulted
on an individual or collective basis. For those individual creditors with whom an agreement has not been reached with
respect to the payment of their claim, the court can reschedule repayment of their claims over a maximum period of
10 years, with the exception of debts with maturity dates exceeding the duration of the plan, in which case their
maturity dates remain the same. The court cannot oblige such creditors to waive any part of their claim. The first
payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount
of each annual installment must be at least 5% of the total admitted pre-filing liabilities (except for agricultural
businesses)).

The court can also impose a plan if one or both of the committees, or the general meeting of noteholders,
does not approve a plan, either by failing to vote within the specified six-month period (which may be extended by
the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator, to the extent it does not exceed the duration of the
observation period) or by rejecting the plan. In such a case, the rules are the same as those applicable to creditors who
are not members of the committees and who are not noteholders (creditors are consulted on an individual or collective
basis and, in particular, the court can only impose a rescheduling of the repayment of the debts over a maximum period
often years, with the exception of debts with maturity dates exceeding the duration of the plan, in which case their
maturity dates remain the same).

Finally, at any time during safeguard proceedings, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into
reorganization proceedings (i) at the request of the debtor company, the court-appointed creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, if the company was already in
_cessation des paiements at the opening of the proceedings, (ii) upon its own initiative or upon request of the debtor_
company, the court-appointed creditors’ representative, the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, if
the company becomes insolvent or (iii) at the debtor’s request or upon request of the court-appointed administrator,
the court-appointed creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor (if no plan has been adopted by the relevant
creditors’ committee and, if any, by the noteholders’ assembly (as described below)), it appears that the adoption of a
safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and the company would shortly become insolvent should the safeguard
proceedings be ended. The court may also convert safeguard (provided the debtor is insolvent) or reorganization
proceedings into liquidation proceedings if recovery of the debtor is manifestly impossible.

**_Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings_**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) if

(i) while not being in cessation des paiements (i.e., being unable to pay its debts as they fall
due out of its available assets) for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation,
it is facing difficulties that it cannot overcome,

(ii) it (a) has its accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public
accountant and has (1) more than twenty employees or (2) a turnover greater than €3 million excluding any
applicable taxes or (3) total assets in its balance sheet greater than €1.5 million, or (b) establishes consolidated
financial statements in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code,

(iii) it is subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings and

(iv) it has prepared, in the context of conciliation proceedings, a draft safeguard plan that aims
to protect its operations in the long run and which is likely to be supported, within the group of those creditors
who will be affected by the accelerated safeguard proceedings, by a sufficiently large majority of them to
allow the adoption of the plan by the creditors’ committees and the noteholders’ general meeting within the
duration of the procedure (i.e. three months from the opening judgment of the accelerated safeguard
procedure).


-----

The accelerated safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast track” the safeguard proceedings for large
companies. The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings is roughly similar to the regular safeguard
proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard proceedings. Therefore
some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims made by owners benefiting from
retention of title clauses are, for instance, excluded by law.

Trade creditors are involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings. Where accelerated safeguard
proceedings are opened, the credit institution committee, the trade creditors’ committee and the general meeting of
noteholders are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the minimum
period of 15 days from delivery of the proposed plan (as applicable in safeguard proceedings).

As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard
proceedings may notably provide for rescheduling of debts (provided that the concerned creditors have agreed to such
rescheduling), debt cancellation, or debt-for-equity swaps (requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months. If, during this period, no
plan is adopted by the required majorities of the creditors’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders, the court
shall terminate the accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**_Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings_**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is similar to that applicable to accelerated
safeguard proceedings, which are now designed as the common “accelerated proceedings” whereas the accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings are designed to “fast-track” safeguard proceedings dealing with purely financial
difficulties.

The key difference between accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is that the latter relate only to debts owed to financial institutions and noteholders (i.e., debts towards
credit institutions that are eligible members of the credit institutions’ committee and debts towards noteholders which
are eligible members of the general meeting of noteholders described above), which are subjected to an automatic stay
and dealt with under the safeguard plan. The company continues to trade normally while the proceedings are pending,
thus reducing significantly the impact of such safeguard proceedings on operational companies. Other classes of
creditors, such as suppliers or public creditors, are not therefore affected by the proceedings.

The same conditions mentioned above for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings also apply to a
debtor eligible for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, provided that the accounts of the debtor offer evidence
that a plan prepared in the context of conciliation proceedings is supported by a large majority of those financial
creditors who will be affected by the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as indicated in the preceding
paragraph), and is likely to be adopted within the duration of the procedure (i.e., one month from the opening judgment
of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings).

The content of the safeguard plan and conditions of its adoption are the same as in accelerated safeguard
proceedings, except that the credit institutions’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders are required to vote
on the proposed safeguard plan within a shortened minimum period of eight days of being notified of the proposed
plan.

The duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings must not exceed one month, unless the court
decides to extend it by one additional month. If, during this period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities of
the financial creditors and noteholders (the same majority rules apply as in committees in regular safeguard
proceedings), the court shall terminate the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and may not impose any
uniform debt rescheduling on creditors.


-----

**_Judicial Reorganization (redressement judiciaire)_**

A judicial reorganization may be initiated with respect to a company incorporated in France (or a foreign
company whose center of main interest is situated in France) if it cannot pay its due debts out of its available assets
(i.e., if it is in cessation des paiements), provided that its situation is capable of improving and it is capable of recovery.

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the court (in very limited cases only) or the
public prosecutor.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming in cessation des
_paiements_ unless it initiated conciliation proceedings within the same period. If it does not, its _de jure_ managers
(including the directors) and, as the case may be, its de facto managers, are subject to civil liability.

The aims of judicial reorganization proceedings are the same as those of safeguard proceedings. Most of the
rules applicable to safeguard proceedings apply to judicial reorganization proceedings. In particular, the opening of
judicial reorganization proceedings triggers an automatic stay of proceedings against the debtor for up to a maximum
of 18 months (subject to the same limited exceptions).

As with safeguard proceedings, the debtor’s management, together with the court-appointed administrator,
is in charge of drafting the plan which will be voted on by the creditors’ committee(s) and the general meeting of
noteholders, as the case may be. Additionally, each member of the committee(s) may propose an alternative
reorganization plan (whereas noteholders may not). Committees of creditors and a general meeting of noteholders
may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings (see above). The reorganization plan can
combine all of the following: a debt restructuring, a re-capitalization of the company, a debt-for-equity swap (subject
to relevant shareholder approval) and the sale of certain assets or of portions of the business. The plan may provide
for a different treatment of creditors if the differences in their situation so justify. The plan submitted to the creditors’
committees and the general meeting of noteholders must take into account intercreditor subordination agreements
entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings.

In the case where the shareholders’ equity has not been restored to a level equal to at least one-half of the
share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code and the reorganization plan provides for
a modification of the share capital in favor of one or more person(s) who undertake to comply with the plan, the courtappointed administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to vote in place of the dissenting shareholders
if they refuse to vote such restoration (Article L. 631-9-1 of the French Commercial Code).

In addition. Article L. 631-19-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that in the cases where

(i) a debtor (a) employs more than 150 employees or (b) controls one or more companies
employing in total more than 150 employees,

(ii) the disappearance of such debtor is likely to cause serious disturbance to the national or
local economy and to local employment, and

(iii) a share capital modification appears—after review of total or partial disposal plan solutions—
the only credible solution to avoid such a disturbance and to allow the debtor’s business activities to continue,

the court may, at the request of the insolvency administrator or the public prosecutor's office and at the end
of a period of three months after the opening judgment, in the event of refusal by the meetings referred to in
I of Article L. 631-19 to adopt the modification of capital provided for by the draft recovery plan in favour
of one or more persons who have undertaken to implement the plan.

In summary, if, in such event, a reorganization plan provides for a modification of the share capital in favor
of one or more person(s) who undertake to execute the plan (e.g., the new majority shareholders) and the existing
shareholders refuse to vote such share capital modification, the court may, under certain procedural and substantial
conditions (e.g., the payment to the evicted shareholders of an amount corresponding to the value of their shares, as
determined by a court-appointed expert if no agreement as to such value is reached among the parties) and upon
request of the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, either (i) appoint a trustee to vote in favor of a


-----

share capital increase in place of the dissenting shareholders or (ii) order, in favor of the person(s) who have undertaken
to execute the plan, the transfer of all or part of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholders who own a majority
of voting rights or hold a blocking minority in the company. Any approval clause is deemed null and void.

If it appears the debtor is not able to ensure the recovery of its business, a total or partial sale of the business
can be ordered by the court, at the request of the court-appointed administrator. In this case, the sale is conducted by
the court-appointed representative of the creditors in accordance with rules applicable to the liquidation procedure.

**_Judicial Liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)_**

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the court (in very limited cases only) or the
public prosecutor if the debtor cannot pay its due debts out of its available assets (i.e., if it is in cessation des paiements)
and its recovery is manifestly not possible (Article L. 640-1 of the French Commercial Code). The aim of these
proceedings is to liquidate a company and end its activities, by selling its business, either as a whole or per branch of
activity or asset by asset. The activity is ended from the opening of proceedings, except if a sale of all or part of the
business is feasible. In such a case, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity during a maximum period
of three months (renewable once) to implement such a sale.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming unable to pay its
due debts out of its available assets (in cessation des paiements). The bankruptcy judge opens a judicial liquidation
rather than a judicial reorganization when it considers that the debtor is unable to continue its business or that there
are no serious chances of improving the company’s prospects through restructuring. Liquidation proceedings trigger
an automatic stay of proceedings against the company. Secured creditors benefiting from a pledge are, however, where
the law applicable to such security arrangements does not prohibit it, entitled to enforce their security interest through
a court monitored allocation process (attribution judiciaire) (i.e., request the court to transfer ownership of the pledged
asset(s)).

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds
to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to
insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings (i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation
process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets, or (ii) in the event where there are
insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and
allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_Void and Voidable Transactions_**

Transactions may be challenged by the court-appointed administrator, court agent, liquidator or public
prosecutor if they are entered into during the so-called “hardening” period (période suspecte) before a judgment
opening judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. Such period runs from the date on which the
company is deemed to be unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets (in cessation des paiements) and can
be backdated by the court up to 18 months before the judgment opening the relevant insolvency proceedings but not
before the court order approving a conciliation agreement (homologation) Certain transactions entered into by the
debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court.

Transactions that are automatically void if performed during the hardening period include transactions or
payments that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors.
These include, notably, transfers of assets for no consideration or for nominal consideration, contracts under which
the obligations of the company significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts
not due at the time of payment, payments of debts due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary
course of business, security granted for debts previously incurred and provisional measures (unless the writ of
attachment or seizure predates the date of _cessation des paiements), the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust_
arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt incurred at the same time), any amendment
to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that dedicates assets or rights as a guarantee of pre-existing debts and a notarized
declaration of non-seizability (déclaration d’insaisissabilité notariée) applying to any assets of the debtor during the
“hardening” period.


-----

Transactions that are voidable by the court include transactions or payments made when due after the date of
_cessation des paiements, such as payments made on accrued debts, transfers of assets for consideration and notices of_
attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during
the “hardening period,” in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the company knew, or should
have known, that it was in a state of cessation des paiements at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer
of assets for no consideration are also voidable when realized during the six-month period prior to the beginning of
the “hardening” period.

There is no “hardening” period prior to the opening of safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, to the extent the debtor was not insolvent when such proceedings were
opened.

**_Status of Creditors_**

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of the
proceedings must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court order opening the proceedings in the Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales
(by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claim arose out
of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest): this period is extended to four months for
creditors domiciled outside France. In the case where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the
existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors’
representative. When a proof of claim is made on behalf of a creditor, such creditor is allowed to ratify it or, if he
wishes so, to replace it by filing its own proof of claim. Creditors who have not submitted their proof of claims during
the relevant period are, except with respect to limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in
connection with the proceedings and their unasserted claims are unenforceable against the debtor if the debtor
complies with the plan’s provisions. Employees are not subject to such obligations and are preferred creditors under
French law.

From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings, the company is prohibited from
paying debts outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially concern the set-off of
inter-related debts (dettes connexes) and, provided that such payments are authorized by the court, payments made to
recover assets required for the continued operation of the business. During this period, creditors may not pursue any
legal action against the company with respect to any claim arising prior to the court order commencing the proceedings
if the objective of such legal action is:

- to obtain an order for or payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor (however, the creditor may
require that a court fix the amount due);

- to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the company; or

- to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the company, except where such asset is located in another
Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights _in rem_ of creditors thereon would not be
affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings or the occurrence of a state of cessation des paiements are not enforceable under French law.
The opening of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of the company’s obligations.
If, however, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity because a sale of all or part of the business is
feasible, the company’s obligations which have not yet arrived at maturity shall only mature as at the date of the
judgment ordering such sale or upon expiry of the period of continued activity authorized by the court.

The court-appointed administrator may elect to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it
believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform, or, on the contrary, to continue such contracts, and in the
latter case can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the company
may have been in default, provided that the company fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and, in
the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, that the debtor pays cash on delivery).


-----

In the context of Accelerated Safeguard or Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings, the above rules
would only apply to the creditors which are subject to the Accelerated Safeguard or Accelerated Financial Safeguard
(see above). In addition, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation
proceedings which is certified by its statutory auditors and filed with the commercial court and which is deemed to be
a filing of their proof of claim by such creditors if they do not file their claim within the general deadlines applicable
in other insolvency proceedings referred to above.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees,
the bankruptcy court, officials appointed by the bankruptcy court as required by the insolvency proceedings, postpetition creditors, certain secured creditors and the French treasury.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code, where insolvency proceedings or safeguard
have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor
on the following grounds (and may only be held liable on those grounds): (i) fraud, (ii) wrongful interference with the
management of the debtor and (iii) the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to
such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found
liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_COVID-19 Crisis_**

The French Government adopted over a year ago, within the context of the Covid 19 health crisis, certain
ordinances which set up some provisional derogations to the existing French insolvency law. Due to the impact of this
crisis on the economy in general, French law was strongly amended and, even today, law and regulations governing
insolvency proceedings still may be subject to other evolutions. Such main measures are:

`o` Ordinance 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, entered into force as from 22 May 2020, which took the lead to
first Ordinance 2020-341 dated 27 March 2020 and brought certain measures applicable to ongoing
proceedings on 22 May 2020 until (depending of said measures) 31 December 2021 (initially until 31
December 2020 or 17 July 2021, and then extended by Law 2020-1525 entered into force as from 9 December
2020 (“Law 2020-1525”)) (the “Ordinance 2020-596”). Ordinance 2020-596 had also clarified certain
transitional law issues applicable to Book VI of French Commercial Code. Application of Articles 1 to 6 of
Ordinance 2020-596 has been extended until 31 December 2021 included (Article 124 of Law 2020-1525 for
accelerating and simplifying public action (Accélération et Simplification de l’Action Publique).

`o` In addition, Ordinance 2020-1443 dated 25 November 2020, entered into force as from 26 November 2020,
regarding adaptation of insolvency to COVID-19 for ongoing proceedings initiated on or after 24 August
2020, as well as to those initiated as from 26 November 2020 until 31 December 2021, (the “Ordinance 20201443” and together with “Ordinance 2020-596”, the “Ordinances”) brought few complementary measures.

Major themes of the Ordinances are:

`o` effectiveness of conciliation proceedings (conciliation) were strongly increased, notably:

`o` any conciliation proceedings (conciliation) may last ten (10) months;

`o` simplification of communications by any means between the different parties to a conciliation
proceeding (conciliation);

`o` in case a creditor party to the conciliation negotiations refuses to suspend its due debt claims,
the relevant debtor may ask the court's president (président du tribunal) to:

            - cancel, or prohibit such creditor to make, any claim against the debtor for any
monetary payment;

            - stop, or prohibit, any execution or enforcement proceedings that may be raised by such
creditor; and


-----

             - report/reschedule payments of any due debt;

`o` creation of a so-called “post money privilege” in relation with safeguard (sauvegarde) and judicial
reorganization (redressement judiciaire) proceedings, on a similar basis to the current exising “new
money privilege” in conciliation; and

`o` extension of the duration of ongoing safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) and reorganization plan (plan
_de redressement judiciaire) up to a maximum of two (2) years._

`o` Law 2020-1525 dated 7 December 2020, entered into force on 9 December 2020, extends the material provisions of
Ordinance 2020-596 until 31 December 2021 (“Law 2020-1525”).

In particular, and due to current renewal of the COVID-19 health crisis, additional ordinances (or other measures as
the case may be), including which may amend, adapt or modify the Ordinances, could be adopted with immediate
application to ongoing procedures by French Government.

**Germany**

**_German Insolvency Law_**

One or more of the guarantors of the notes and/or providers of a guarantee for the notes (together the “German
Security Providers”) are incorporated in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of any such German company, subject
to the statements made above under the heading “European Union” and that a relevant German Security Provider was
held to have its center of main interests within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of
insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) was filed, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Germany.
Such proceedings would then be governed by German law.

Under German law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor. The debtor is over-indebted if its liabilities exceed
the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich). The debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when
they fall due. If a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—“GmbH”) or any other
kind of limited liability company gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such
company and, in certain circumstances its shareholders, are obliged to file for insolvency without delay, however, at
the latest within three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, illiquidity, and/or within six weeks after the
mandatory insolvency reason over-indebtedness, has occurred (the “Relevant Deadline”). Non-compliance with these
obligations exposes management to both civil law damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once
illiquidity or over-indebtedness has occurred, the management of the insolvent company is generally not allowed to
make any payments, including any payments under the note guarantees (unless such payments can be considered as
having been made in the ordinary course of business (im ordnungsgemäßen Geschäftsgang), e.g. because they were
required to maintain the business operation, and are made prior to the expiry of the Relevant Deadline). In addition,
the debtor can file for insolvency proceedings if it is imminently at risk to be unable to pay its debts as and when they
fall due (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Imminent illiquidity exists if the company is currently able to service its
payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so within a prognosis period of the next 24
months. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obligated) to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic certain provisions of German insolvency law have been temporarily
suspended or relaxed: (i) First of all, the obligation of the management to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor was initially suspended until 30 September 2020
unless (x) the insolvency is not caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or (y) there is no prospect of resolving the
insolvency. (ii) Secondly, corresponding payment prohibitions have been relaxed insofar as the conditions for the
suspension of the duty to file for insolvency are met. The suspensions or relaxations under (i) and (ii) initially applied
until 30 September 2020. The obligation to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) only (but
not illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) was further suspended until 31 December 2020). Thereafter, the obligation to
file for insolvency has only been further partially suspended in order to take account of delayed disbursements of


-----

financial aid under a government relief program to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (“Corona
Aid”). From 1 January until 30 April 2021 the obligation of the management to file for insolvency due to overindebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) has been suspended for debtors which applied for
Corona Aid between 1 November 2020 and 28 February 2021, or which have omitted to apply for Corona Aid during
that period for legal or factual causes but would be entitled to such Corona Aid, unless (y) the debtor has obviously
no prospects of obtaining Corona Aid, or (z) the Corona Aid is not sufficient to remedy the insolvency. The periods
for which the duty to file for insolvency has been suspended as set out above, hereinafter referred to as the “Suspension
Period”.

In addition, the forecast period relevant for determining as to whether the continuation of the debtor’s
business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) (and the debtor is therefore not obligated to file for
insolvency proceedings on the basis of over-indebtedness) is from 1 January 2021 until December 2021 shortened
from the usual 12 months to a period of just four months, if the debtor's over-indebtedness resulted from the Covid19 pandemic.

Insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary
protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce
individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings as far as these protective measures
are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. As part of such
protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter),
unless the debtor has petitioned for self-administration proceedings (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in
which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the
supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that no circumstances are known which lead to the expectation
that self-administration will place the creditors at a disadvantage. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business
operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for self-administration, or on the profile of the (preliminary)_
insolvency administrator to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by
the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such
suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible, i.e., not competent and/or not
impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it
shall include a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large and one for the small creditors as well as one
for the employees. The rights and duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator depend on the decision of the
court. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the
debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets
of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss)
of main insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the
debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor) or illiquidity and/or overindebted and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. Otherwise, the
petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be dismissed for insufficiency of assets. If insolvency
proceedings are opened, the court usually appoints an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full
power to dispose of the debtor’s assets, and the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency
creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the
occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) unless there is good cause for his replacement
(wichtiger Grund), with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of
insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the
proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. As
an exception, the court may order insolvency proceedings to be run by the relevant debtor itself under the supervision
of a custodian (Sachwalter), in which case the relevant debtor retains, to a large extent, its authority to dispose of its
assets. Such order remains subject to review and may be repealed in which case an insolvency administrator would be
appointed. An insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue
the debtor’s operations and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseschulden) will be
preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor (including secured debt).


-----

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured, (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency
estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) that wish to assert claims against the debtor in person need to participate in the
insolvency proceedings. Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of
its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a
court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings
commence). If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor acquires
through execution (i.e., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part
of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency
proceedings. Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata
basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are not entitled to
enforce their security interests after an insolvency petition has been filed to the extent the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral (though, between the
time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence, such stay on
enforcement requires a court order) but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency
proceedings. In this context it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize
any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable
assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims
that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested
with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the
value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in
the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any) and are disbursed to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the
remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the
insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred
liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other
claims (insolvency claims— Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a
pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security
interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Accordingly, if a German
Security Provider were to grant security over its assets to other creditors, such security may result in a preferred
treatment of such secured creditors while the remaining assets may not be sufficient to satisfy the noteholders’ claims
under the guarantee granted by such German Security Provider. In addition, it may take several years before an
insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency
proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of the non-subordinated creditors
(including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds
can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and requires the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance
with specific majority rules. Following a recent amendment of German insolvency law, it is also possible to implement
a debt-to-equity-swap through an insolvency plan. However, a creditor may not be forced into a debt-to-equity
conversion if such creditor did not consent to the swap of its claims into equity of the relevant debtor.

If the debtor has filed for the self-administration proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) and “protective shield”
proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) due to over-indebtedness or imminent illiquidity the court will, upon request of
the debtor, prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other
preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent
expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not evidently futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and
that the debtor is not already illiquid. During such period of preliminary insolvency proceedings, the debtor shall
prepare an insolvency plan which will be implemented in formal self-administration proceedings (Eigenverwaltung)
after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened (in case the court has ordered self-administration proceedings).

The German insolvency laws have been subject to further amendments following the implementation of the
EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring
frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on
restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) which was adopted on June 20, 2019. The EU
Restructuring Directive was published on June 26, 2019 in the Official Journal of the European Union, from which
date the member states will have approximately two years to implement the substantive parts of the EU Restructuring


-----

Directive in their national legislation, although a one-year extension can be granted. The EU Restructuring Directive
aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance
frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and
associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the EU Restructuring Directive is the introduction of
a preventive restructuring framework. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied
by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization), but leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the
implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework
pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a
majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and
against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e., outside formal insolvency
proceedings. The EU Restructuring Directive also provides for cross class cram down, i.e., even if the creditors of one
class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the
restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the EU Restructuring
Directive provides for a stay on enforcement. On December 22, 2020 the German Bundestag passed the “Act on the
further development of the Restructuring and Insolvency Law” (Sanierungs- _und_
_Insolvenzrechtsfortentwicklungsgesetz (SanInsFoG)) providing in particular for the implementation of the EU_
Restructuring Directive into German law by way of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG). In
addition to the implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive, the SanInsFoG, _inter alia, also includes_
amendments to the provisions dealing with the managing director's obligation to file for insolvency proceedings, to
the provisions relating to the managing director's liability for payments made by an insolvent company and to the
procedure of self-administration (Eigenverwaltung). The SanInsFoG for the most part (including the StaRUG) entered
into force on January 1, 2021 with a few remaining provisions to follow on January 1, 2022 and July 17, 2022,
respectively.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Any guarantee granted by a German Security Provider incorporated in the form of a GmbH (limited liability
company) or another kind of German company with limited liability is subject to certain provisions of the German
Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend der Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung— “GmbHG”).

Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its
shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves)
is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital. The granting of guarantees by a GmbH in
order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements
under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable a GmbH to issue guarantees to secure guarantee liabilities of
a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market
practice to subject such guarantee to a so called “limitation language.” Pursuant to such limitation language, the
beneficiaries of the guarantees and secured parties agree to enforce the guarantee against the GmbH only to the extent
that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s net assets falling below its stated share capital or, if the net
assets are already below its stated share capital, does not further reduce such amount. Accordingly, the documentation
in relation to the guarantees, to the extent they concern a German Security Provider, contain such limitation language
and, hence, such guarantees are limited in the manner described.

The court decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called
“destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a company
of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the
enforcement of guarantees granted by the German Security Providers. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be
realized in an enforcement process may be reduced. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law
with respect to the granting of guarantees by the German Security Providers. In addition, a managing director of a
GmbH can be held liable pursuant to Section 15 b the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) for payments to
the shareholders of the GmbH if such payments lead to the illiquidity of the GmbH. This provision may also be applied
by courts with respect to the enforcement of guarantees granted by the German Security Providers. Therefore, the
above-mentioned “limitation language” may also include provisions which exclude the enforcement of a guarantee to
the extent this would lead to the illiquidity of the GmbH.


-----

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Security Provider governed by insolvency
laws of Germany, a guarantee provided by that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung).

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to
the insolvent debtor’s creditors as a whole and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings.
Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the noteholders as well as granting them any security
interest or guarantee, such as the guarantee granted in connection with the issuance of the notes. An administrator’s
right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions that have occurred up to
ten years prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a transaction
is successfully avoided, the noteholders would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received to the insolvency
estate or to forfeit the guarantee.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the issuance of
guarantees as well as the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

    - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including
a guarantee) or satisfaction (i) if such act was performed during the last three months prior to the filing
of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity
(or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) if such
act was performed after the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings
and the creditor had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor or the filing of such petition (or of
circumstances that imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing);

    - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including
a guarantee) or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction if
(i) such act was performed during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement
of the insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was performed during the second or third
month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was
performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of
the insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was
detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that such act
was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors);

    - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which a
proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if (i) it was entered into during the
three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the
debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge
of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) it was entered into after such filing and the counterparty to such
transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;

    - any act whereby a debtor grants security (including guarantees) for a third party debt, which might be
regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), if it was effected in the four years prior to
the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;

    - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years (or four years, if such act provided for security or
satisfaction in favor of the other party) prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of
such intention at the time of such act;

    - any act that provides security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction for a shareholder loan made to the
debtor or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act occurred during the ten


-----

years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the
filing of such petition, or (ii), in the case of satisfaction, the act occurred during the last year prior to the
filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition; and

    - any act whereby the debtor satisfies for a loan payment claim or an economically equivalent claim of a
third party if: (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor
for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the avoidance of certain acts (Rechtshandlung) or transactions
(Rechtsgeschäfte) have been temporarily suspended or relaxed. This includes, in particular, the repayment of a loan
which was granted during an applicable Suspension Period (as defined above (i.e. the period during which the
obligation to file for insolvency proceedings had been suspended in the specific case as set out above)) by 30
September 2023 and the provision of collateral to secure such loans during the Suspension Period which are not
considered to be disadvantageous to the creditors; (this concept also applies to the repayment of new shareholder loans
(but not to the collateralization of shareholder loans)). Furthermore, payments made on or before 31 March 2022 on
claims for which an extension of payment was granted during an applicable Suspension Period before 28 February
2021 are considered not to be disadvantageous to the creditors provided that no insolvency proceedings were opened
by 18 February 2021. In addition, if the prerequisites for the suspension of the obligation to file an application are met,
congruent legal acts taken during the applicable Suspension Period are privileged in terms of avoidance in insolvency
proceedings unless the opponent knew that the debtor's restructuring and financing efforts were not suitable for
eliminating an illiquidity which had occurred.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor that has obtained an
enforcement order but has failed to obtain full satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, has, under
certain circumstances, the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of
guarantees and security interests pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz).

In addition, a creditor who granted a loan or obtained security from a debtor in financial difficulties may be
liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s insolvency or financial difficulty at the time security was
granted. Under German law creditors risk becoming liable under Section 826 of the German Civil Code (i) for
deceiving other creditors about the creditworthiness of the borrower thereby inducing other creditors to continue
making business with the borrower and (ii) for causing a delay of an application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings in order to obtain an advantage in the time gained. The German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of
detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos
mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security is close to financial collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. In connection with the German legislation
dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also the before mentioned concepts have been relaxed in relation
to the granting of new credit and collateral during the Suspension Period, which pursuant to such legislation shall not
be regarded as a contra bonos mores contribution to a delay in the filing for insolvency proceedings.

**Switzerland**

**_Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (any such guarantor, a “Swiss Guarantor”),
and as such any insolvency proceeding applicable to such a company is governed by Swiss law. The insolvency laws
of Switzerland, which is not a member state of the European Union, may not be as favorable to your interests as
creditors as the laws of the United States or Europe, or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.


-----

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

In general, the following types of proceedings (together, “insolvency proceedings”) may be opened against
an entity incorporated in Switzerland:

    - Bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurs), the opening of which may be requested, inter alia by the Swiss
company itself or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the bankruptcy court having
jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company (i) is insolvent or (ii) over-indebted.
Bankruptcy proceedings are primarily designed to realize the assets of the bankrupt entity in order to pay
off its debts. One of the main effects of such proceedings is the stay on enforcement of claims by creditors;

    - Composition proceedings (Nachlassverfahren), the obtaining of which may be requested by the Swiss
company itself or an Obligor, if the same would also be entitled to file for bankruptcy. Composition
proceedings are primarily designed to conclude a composition agreement, whereby, either assets of the
debtor are realized and a dividend is paid to the creditors (Ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag) or assets of the
debtor are assigned to creditors or third parties (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), both
composition agreements need to be approved either by a majority of creditors, representing 2/3 of all
outstanding claims, or by 1/4 of the creditors, representing 3/4 of all outstanding claims. The composition
proceedings will trigger a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In the event of a bankruptcy of a Swiss Guarantor, claims against such Swiss Guarantor related to the notes
are considered “third class” claims, ranking among others after claims secured by collateral, claims of employees and
claims for social security contributions.

**_Impact of Insolvency Proceedings on Transactions_**

In general, during insolvency proceedings, enforcement measures by creditors are suspended and/or limited,
including most of the secured creditors and as a result thereof, you should note that declarations of default and
subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) will be affected by
bankruptcy and composition proceedings as well.

**_Suspect and Fraudulent Transactions_**

Certain transactions entered into and payments made (as listed in the pertinent section of the Swiss Debt
Collection and Bankruptcy Code) during a particular period prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy (période suspecte,
as set out by the law) can be challenged by creditors or the administrator in bankruptcy in a court proceeding (actio
_pauliana) and be set aside. In particular, the following may be challenged:_

    - securities given, set-offs made and payments of non-matured debts by an entity, which was at the time
of the transaction over-indebted, during a one-year period prior to the commencing of the insolvency
proceeding, unless the recipient acted in good faith;

    - assets or valuables given without or without adequate consideration (gifts or favors) during a one-year
period prior to the commencing of the insolvency proceeding; and

    - transactions made with the apparent intent to defraud creditors, or to favor one or more creditors to the
disadvantage of other creditors, within five years prior to the commencing of the insolvency proceeding.

**_Continuance of Ongoing Contracts_**

The bankruptcy administrator has discretion to decide whether or not to continue the performance under
ongoing bilateral contracts (i.e., contracts with continuing obligations existing before the bankruptcy order) for the
time being, unless the parties have contractually agreed that the occurrence of bankruptcy constitutes an early
termination event. However, if the bankruptcy administrator decides to continue to perform under a contract, the
contractual counterparty may ask that the continued performance be secured by the bankruptcy estate.

The counterparty to an agreement with a bankrupt entity which are not continued or performed by the
bankruptcy administrator may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with


-----

the claims of all of the other unsecured third class creditors (i.e., the contractual counterparty may not require specific
performance of the contract).

**_Limitation on Guarantee_**

The granting of guarantees by an entity incorporated in Switzerland is subject to specific limitations and
requirements relating to corporate object and corporate benefit: The granting of guarantees must not be prohibited by
the corporate object (Gesellschaftszweck) and must be for its “corporate benefit.”

Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (Gesellschaftsinteresse) exists under Swiss law,
corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or
indirect economic or commercial benefit. The provision of a guarantee for the obligations of direct or indirect
subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of cross-stream and upstream third party
guarantees may be more problematic. Failure to comply with the above mentioned corporate benefit requirement will
typically result in liability of the directors of the Swiss company granting such third party guarantee. The question
whether a third party guarantee granted in the absence of corporate interest could be held null and void is debated in
legal doctrine. While some authors express the view that an absence of corporate interest could give rise to liability of
the directors of the relevant company only, others consider that the consequences could be that the relevant obligations
are null and void. Hence, in addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors of the Swiss company,
a guarantee provided by the Swiss company could itself be held unenforceable, if it is seen to be contrary to public
policy (ordre public) in case of facts establishing a misuse of corporate assets.

Notwithstanding the above, the liabilities of any Swiss Guarantor under any up-stream or cross-stream
guarantee are (to the extent that such is a requirement of applicable Swiss law in force at the relevant time) limited to
a sum equal to the maximum amount of the Swiss Guarantor’s reserves and profits available for distribution as
dividends at any given time, provided that such limitations shall not free the Swiss Guarantor from payment
obligations in excess of its freely distributable reserves and profits, but merely postpone the payment date of those
obligations until such time as payment is permitted notwithstanding such limitations. The payment under the
respective guarantee and the enforcement of security interest may require certain prior corporate formalities to be
completed including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

Moreover, the enforcement of the respective guarantee or any security interest granted may give rise to Swiss
withholding taxes on dividends (of up to 53.8% at present rates) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such
guarantee or security interest, respectively, falls to be regarded as a deemed distribution for Swiss withholding tax
purposes.

For the above reasons, it is standard market practice for guarantees made by Swiss Companies to contain socalled “limitation language” in relation to its guarantees limiting its liability to the maximum distributable amount.

**Ireland**

**_Enforcement of Liabilities_**

We have been advised by counsel that neither Canada nor the United States currently have a treaty with
Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any Canadian or U.S. federal or state court based
on civil liability, whether or not based solely on Canadian or U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not
automatically be enforceable in Ireland. A judgment of the Canadian or U.S. courts will be enforced by the Irish courts
if the following general requirements are met: (i) the procedural rules of the Canadian or U.S. court must have been
observed and the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict
of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and (ii) the judgment must be
final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be
final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where however, the effect of lodging
an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the
judgment should not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of
appearance is final and conclusive. However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the Canadian or
U.S. courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons: (a) if the judgment is not for a


-----

definite sum of money; (b) if the judgment was obtained by fraud; (c) if the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland
would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice; (d) if the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves
certain Canadian or United States laws which will not be enforced in Ireland; or (e) if jurisdiction cannot be obtained
by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside
Ireland under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules.

In addition, in the event of any proceedings being brought in an Irish court in respect of a monetary obligation
expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, an Irish court would have power to give judgment expressed
as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Ireland
would be available only in Euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into Euro.

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

_Liquidation. As one of the guarantors—Novelis Aluminium Holding Unlimited Company (the “Irish_
Guarantor”)—is an Irish incorporated company, the Irish Guarantor may be wound up under Irish law. On a liquidation
of the Irish Guarantor, certain categories of preferential debts and the claims of secured creditors would be paid in
priority to the claims of unsecured creditors. In particular:

(i) under Irish law, the claims of creditors holding fixed charges may rank behind other
creditors (namely fees, costs and expenses of any examiner appointed and certain capital gains tax liabilities)
and, in the case of fixed charges over book debts, may rank behind claims of the Irish Revenue
Commissioners for “pay-as-you earn”, pay related social insurance, local property tax and any tax imposed
in conformity with the Council Directive of November 28, 2006 on the common system of value added tax
(EC Directive 2006/112) and any other tax of a similar fiscal nature substituted for, or levied in addition to
such tax whether in the European Union, or elsewhere in any jurisdiction together with any interest and
penalties thereon;

(ii) under Irish law, for a charge to be characterized as a fixed charge, the charge holder is
required to exercise the requisite level of control over the assets purported to be charged and the proceeds of
such assets including any bank account into which such proceeds are paid. There is a risk therefore that even
a charge which purports to be taken as a fixed charge may take effect as a floating charge if a court deems
that the requisite level of control was not exercised; and

(iii) under Irish law, the claims of certain other creditors (including the Irish Revenue
Commissioners for certain unpaid taxes), as well as those of creditors mentioned above, will rank in priority
to claims of unsecured creditors and claims of creditors holding floating charges.

If the Irish Guarantor becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and has obligations to creditors that are
treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the holders of the notes, the holders of the notes may
suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings.

Under Irish insolvency law, a liquidator of the Irish Guarantor could apply to a court to have set aside certain
transactions entered into by the Irish Guarantor before the commencement of liquidation, including the granting of a
guarantee and any the payment of any amounts thereunder. Section 604 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014 (as amended)
provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made
or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due, in favor of any creditor or person
on trust for a creditor and where such act was done to give such creditor or any surety or guarantor for the debt due,
to such creditor a preference over other creditors shall be deemed to be an unfair preference and will be invalid if (a)
a winding up of the company commences within six months of doing the act; and (b) the company is at the time of the
commencement of the winding up unable to pay its debts (taking into account the contingent and prospective
liabilities). Where the conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other action is in favor of a
connected person the six-month period is extended to two years. In addition, any such act in favor of a connected
person is deemed a preference over the other creditors and as such to be an unfair preference and invalid accordingly.

Under section 608 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014 (as amended), if it can be shown on the application of a
liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up to the satisfaction of the Irish High Court
that any property of such company was disposed of and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on


-----

the company, its creditors or members, the Irish High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable, order any person
who appears to have “use, control or possession” of such property or the proceeds of the sale or development thereof
to deliver it or pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the Irish High Court sees fit. In deciding
whether it is just and equitable to make an order under section 608, the Irish High Court must have regard to the rights
of persons who have bona fide and for value acquired an interest in the property the subject of the application.

_Examinership. Examinership is a legal mechanism in Ireland for the temporary protection and potential_
rescue or reconstruction of an ailing but potentially viable Irish company. An Irish company, its directors, its
shareholders holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of its voting share capital, or a
contingent, prospective or actual creditor, are each entitled to petition the Irish High Court for the appointment of an
examiner.

While a company is in examinership, it may not be wound up, creditors may not enforce their claims or their
security in respect of the company or its assets, and proceedings cannot be issued or potentially continued against it
without the leave of the Irish High Court. Further, a company in examinership cannot discharge any liability incurred
by it before the presentation to the Irish Court of the petition for examinership except in strictly defined circumstances.
The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company
after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to his
appointment.

Where possible, an examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement in respect
of a company in examinership (the “Proposals”) which he/she believes will ensure the survival of the company or the
whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. The Proposals will detail, among other things, how each class
of creditor is to be treated in the context of the examinership and in particular the dividend, if any, they are to receive.
A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the Irish High Court when at least one class of creditors, whose interests
are impaired under the proposals, has voted in favor of the proposals and the Irish High Court is satisfied that such
proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals
and whose interests would be impaired by the implementation of the scheme of arrangement and the proposals are not
unfairly prejudicial to any interested party.

If, for any reason, an examiner was appointed to the Irish Guarantor while any amounts due under the notes
were unpaid, the primary risks to the holders of the notes are as follows:

    - the trustee, on behalf of the holders of the notes, would not be able to take proceeding to enforce rights
under the guarantee against the Irish Guarantor during the period of examinership;

    - a scheme of arrangement may be approved involving the writing down of the debt due by the Irish
Guarantor to the holders of the notes irrespective of their views;

    - an examiner may seek to set aside any negative pledge given by the Irish Guarantor prohibiting the
creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Irish Guarantor to enable the examiner to
borrow to fund the Irish Guarantor during the protection period; and

    - in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Irish Guarantor subsequently goes into
liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the
examiner on behalf of the Irish Guarantor and approved by the Irish High Court) and the claims of certain
other creditors referred to above (including the Irish Revenue Commissioners for certain unpaid taxes)
will take priority over the amounts due by the Irish Guarantor to the holders of the notes.

Furthermore, the Irish High Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator
appointed by the Irish High Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions set aside
under section 604 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014 or section 608 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014.

**_Limitation on Liability_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a guarantee provided by the Irish Guarantor, such guarantee will
be subject to the following limitations:


-----

    - the obligations and liabilities of the Irish Guarantor under any guarantee or any security interest granted
by it shall not include any obligation or liability which, if incurred, would constitute unlawful financial
assistance within the meaning of section 82 of the Companies Act 2014 or any equivalent and applicable
provisions under the laws of any relevant jurisdiction.

**Dubai International Financial Centre (United Arab Emirates)**

**_Laws and Regulations_**

The guarantor, Novelis MEA Ltd, is incorporated in the Dubai International Financial Centre (“DIFC”) in
the Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The DIFC is a federally decreed entity, which is limited to a specific
geographical area within the Emirate of Dubai, and whose powers are specifically established by the Government of
Dubai. Dubai is a member of the UAE, a federal Islamic state.

The DIFC has a separate legal and judicial system that is independent from the Emirates of Dubai; and in
accordance with the UAE Federal Law No. 8 of 2004, the federal civil and commercial laws of the UAE are not
applicable to the DIFC. The DIFC regulatory bodies and courts oversee and govern all matters relating to and arising
within the DIFC.

However, all Emirates of the UAE apply UAE federal law to the extent that such legislation has been passed
in relation to matters within the federal jurisdiction. The constitution of the UAE permits the Emirates to legislate on
certain areas, however, only in the absence of such federal law or regulation will the domestic law of each Emirate
and/or DIFC apply (except to the extent the applicability of the relevant federal law has been excluded by a federal
decree).

Notwithstanding the independent nature of the legal and judicial system of the DIFC, it still sits within the
geographical area of the Emirate of Dubai. Therefore, the laws of the DIFC are subject to the constitution of the UAE
(the “UAE Constitution”). The UAE Constitution provides at Article 7 that “Shari’a shall be a main source of
_legislation in the Union”. In addition, the Civil Code provides at Article 2 that the “rules and principles of Islamic_
_jurisprudence shall be relied upon in the understanding, construction and interpretation of these provisions”. The_
interpretation and application of _Shari’a_ is a matter of opinion and debate, and may be subject to differing
interpretations by Islamic scholars, _Shari’a_ supervisory and advisory boards and the courts. Although legislative
jurisdiction remains with the member Emirates in all matters not assigned to the UAE federal government, Shari’a
could in theory be held to apply in respect of matters governed by the DIFC law.

The field of conflict of laws is not well developed in the UAE. Under Article 151 of the UAE Constitution,
the provisions of the UAE Constitution prevail over the constitutions of the Emirates, and the federal laws which are
issued in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution have priority over the legislation, regulations and
decisions issued by the authorities of each of the Emirates. In the event of conflict, that part of the inferior (Emirate)
legislation which is inconsistent with the superior (federal) legislation should be rendered null and void to the extent
that this removes the inconsistency. In case of dispute, the matter will be referred to the Federal Supreme Court for its
ruling. In case of a dispute between the legislation and jurisdiction of the Emirates of Dubai and the DIFC, the matter
will be referred to the Joint Judicial Committee for its ruling.

The legal system within the DIFC is based on the English common law. However, given that it is a relatively
new jurisdiction with a somewhat untested legal framework and limited judicial precedents, there remains a degree of
uncertainty as to how the relevant provision of the DIFC law would be applied by a DIFC Courts. The DIFC Law No.
10 of 2004 – DFIC Court Law allows the courts of the DFIC to consider decisions of the other courts. The DIFC
courts often look at the English law and other common law precedents for guidance, but these precedents only have
persuasive value and are not binding on the courts of DIFC.

In the event insolvency proceedings were to occur in relation to Novelis MEA Ltd., the guarantor will be
subject to the following legislation:

(i) DIFC Companies Law, DIFC Law No. 5 of 2018 (the “Companies Law”); and


-----

(ii) DIFC Insolvency Law, DIFC Law No. 1 of 2019 (the “Insolvency Law”) and the DIFC Insolvency
Regulations (the “Insolvency Regulations”),

which together govern insolvency proceedings.

**_Limitation on Guarantees and Corporate Benefit_**

DIFC companies are not precluded from providing guarantees to parent companies. That said, a guarantee
given by a company in respect of the obligations of a company which is its direct or indirect parent (or a subsidiary of
its direct or indirect parent which is not also its subsidiary) may be unenforceable if the giving of that guarantee
amounts to an unlawful distribution to its shareholders or a reduction in its capital.


A subsidiary can guarantee, or grant a security for, a loan to its parent, subject to the:


(i) company's constitutional documents not restricting the provision of this type of security; and
(ii) necessary corporate approvals, such as board resolutions and, where necessary, shareholders'
resolutions, having been obtained.

The DIFC, which operates in accordance with a common law framework, requires that the company’s
directors, in satisfaction of their fiduciary duties, to have considered the corporate benefit to the company and its
members as a whole, and the furtherance of the company’s interest in the provision of the guarantee.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Insolvency Law and Insolvency Regulations allow for various procedures that can be undertaken in
relation to a distressed company, which include (i) voluntary arrangement, (ii) rehabilitation, (iii) administration, (iv)
receivership, and (v) winding-up. Under certain procedures, the availability of a moratorium may affect the
enforceability of a guarantee or other security interest. There have only been limited formal insolvency applications
of any entity incorporated in the DIFC, and there remains a degree of uncertainty as to how any of the relevant DIFC
insolvency processes would be applied in practice.

**_Rehabilitation Mechanism_**

The rehabilitation mechanism under the Insolvency Law and Insolvency Regulations allows for a company
to propose a rehabilitation plan to company creditors with a view to restructuring its debts. A company would be
eligible to apply to court for a rehabilitative plan where the company is, or is likely to, become unable to pay its debts
and there is a reasonable likelihood of a successful rehabilitation plan being reached between the company, its creditors
and its shareholders, unless specifically excluded by prescribed regulations. Application for a rehabilitation plan may
only be commenced by the company and, significantly, cannot be commenced by a creditor of the company.

**_Moratorium and Implications_**

If a winding-up order has been issued against Novelis MEA Ltd., no action or proceeding may be proceeded
with or commenced against the company or its property, except by leave of the courts and subject to such terms as
the courts may impose.

Under the Insolvency Law, a moratorium may be granted for the company by a court either on an application
to it (in case where the company makes a proposal to its shareholders and creditors for an arrangement of its affairs
(“Voluntary Arrangement”)) or automatically (where the company notified the court that it is or is likely to become
unable to pay its debts and there is a reasonable likelihood of a successful rehabilitation plan being reached between
the Company and its creditors and shareholders (“Rehabilitation”). During the period for which a moratorium is in
force, amongst other things:

(a) in the case of Voluntary Arrangement:

(i) no petition may be presented for the winding up of the company;

(ii) no resolution may be passed or order made for the winding up of the company;


-----

(iii) no administrative receiver may be appointed on the company;

(iv) no steps may be taken (including by a secured party) to enforce any security interest in the company’s

property, except with the leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose;

(v) no other proceedings or other legal process (including execution proceedings) may be commenced or
continued, and no distress may be levied, against the company or its property except with the leave of
the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose.

(b) in the case of Rehabilitation, an automatic moratorium shall immediately apply to all creditors, secured or
unsecured and without their consent, in respect of the company and its assets wherever located and in addition
to (a) above:

(i) it will not render any undue debt due and payable. Any contrary provision in a contract, or in any
applicable law shall be deemed unenforceable for the moratorium period (i.e., unless otherwise
ordered by the court, a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date the company
notifies the Rehabilitation to the court).

(ii) any termination or modification provision in any contract linked to an insolvency related term ceases
to have effect during the moratorium period, unless:

(A) the company agrees to the termination; or

(B) the court grants permission to terminate; or

(C) any sums due after the commencement of the moratorium period which the company has agreed
to pay and remain unpaid for a period of more than twenty (20) days after the payment is due.

(iii) a creditor of the company is precluded from exercising any right of set-off in respect of any obligation

due from such company.

A court may however grant relief from the moratorium in relation to any specific creditor(s) on such terms
and conditions as the court finds to be equitable, upon the application of any creditor(s). In doing so, the court will
have regard to whether there is any imminent irreparable harm to the company in the absence of a moratorium in
relation to that specific creditor and whether the creditor would suffer any significant loss which the company cannot
compensate.

**_Administration_**

Creditors may also avail of the administration process under the Insolvency Law. An application for the
appointment of an administrator may only be made by one or more creditors either jointly or separately in
circumstances where an application for Rehabilitation has been made and there is evidence of misconduct or
mismanagement.

In such instances, creditors may apply for the appointment of an administrator who will manage the business
and assets of the company for the 120-day moratorium or such other period as directed. During this period, similar to
Rehabilitation, the company will be protected against its creditors. Upon conclusion of the moratorium period, the
court may approve a rehabilitation plan or a voluntary arrangement with creditors or some other specific scheme of
arrangement.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue or for Unlawful Preference_**

The Insolvency Law provides for an appointed liquidator or administrator to apply to court to set aside
transactions that were made at an undervalue or given at a preference. To be set aside, a transaction at an undervalue,
or a preference which was given to a connected person, must have been entered into within two years prior to the onset
of insolvency or in the case of a preference which was given to an unconnected person, within six months prior to the
onset of insolvency.


-----

Transactions that result in the company receiving no consideration, or consideration the value of which, in
money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration
provided by the company will be regarded as undervalued transactions.

Transactions where the company gives a preference to a company creditor, surety or guarantor, for any of
the company's debts or other liabilities, and the company does anything or suffers anything to be done which (in either
case) has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of the company going into insolvent
liquidation, will be better than the position it would have been in if that thing had not been done, will be regarded as
transactions at a preference and may be considered unlawful.

**_Preferred creditors_**

A company’s liabilities in connection with a guarantee will, in the event of a winding-up of the company,
rank behind certain regulatory and government debts and expenses properly incurred in the winding-up of the company
(including the remuneration of the liquidator) and those debts of the company that are entitled to priority under DIFC
law. Preferential debts under DIFC law fall into two categories:

(a) contributions to pension schemes and end of service gratuity payments; and
(b) various forms of employee remuneration.

**_Priority Funding_**

Where the company is under Rehabilitation, the court may, in its discretion, authorize the company to obtain
secured or unsecured credit and incur secured or unsecured debt which debt (including any interest) has priority over
unsecured debt or is secured by an interest on the property of the company that is not otherwise subject to a security
interest or is secured by a junior security interest on property of the company that is already subject to a security
interest. In case where the company is unable to obtain credit, the court may authorize the obtaining of credit or the
incurring of debt secured by a senior or equal security interest on property of the company that is already subject to a
security interest. The court may however may only provide such authorization if adequate protection is available to
the existing secured creditor against a diminution in the value of its security interest to the extent such diminution is
occasioned by the moratorium or with the consent of that existing holder of the security interest.

**_Proof of Debts_**

Where the company is being wound up, a creditor of the company is required to submit its claim to the
liquidator and, at its cost, prove the debt payable by the company to the creditor.

**Brazil**

**_General Considerations_**

Under Brazilian law, obligations resulting from the guarantee granted by Novelis do Brasil Ltda. (the
“Brazilian Guarantor”) are subordinated to certain statutory preferences. In the event of liquidation, bankruptcy or
judicial reorganization of the Brazilian Guarantor, such statutory preferences, including post-petition claims, court
fees and expenses, claims for salaries and wages (up to a certain limit per employee), indemnification for on-the-job
accidents, social security and taxes, as well as secured credits and certain credits that are not subject to the insolvency
proceedings will have preference over unsecured claims. In such a scenario, noteholders may be unable to collect
amounts that they are due under the notes upon enforcement of the guarantee, as detailed below.

**_Considerations on Enforcement_**

Civil claims may be brought before Brazilian courts based on agreements governed by the laws of a foreign
jurisdiction, such as the indenture or the notes, provided that such law does not contravene Brazilian public policy,
national sovereignty and good moral character, that the choice of law is admissible under Brazilian Law and that
Brazilian courts can assert jurisdiction over the particular subject matters. As a general rule, Brazilian courts have
jurisdiction over claims with defendants domiciled in Brazil, when the obligation shall be fulfilled in Brazil, when the
facts giving grounds to the lawsuits arise in Brazil, claims involving real estate located in Brazil, or the probate and


-----

apportionment of assets located in Brazil. Brazilian courts also have jurisdiction whenever the parties voluntarily
submitted to the jurisdiction of Brazilian courts. The foreign law shall be proved by the party that alleges it. Documents
in a foreign language must be translated into Portuguese by a sworn translator in order to ensure their admission before
courts in Brazil; in addition to said translation, foreign documents must (a) have the signatures of the parties thereto
notarized by a notary public licensed as such under the law of the place of signing and (i) the signature of such notary
public must be authenticated by a consular official of Brazil, or (ii) if the document is covered by the Hague convention
abolishing the legalization for foreign public documents, be apostilled; and (b) be registered together with their sworn
translation with a registrar of deeds and documents in Brazil.

Judgments by non-Brazilian courts may be enforced in Brazil without reconsideration of the merits, by
ratification of that judgment by the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (Superior Tribunal de Justiça). That
confirmation generally will be available if the foreign judgment: (i) fulfills all formalities required for its enforceability
under the laws of the country where the foreign judgment is granted; (ii) is issued by a competent court after proper
service of process (whereby service of process instituted against a Brazilian resident party is effected in accordance
with Brazilian law); (iii) is final and therefore not subject to appeals; (iv) provides for the payment of sum certain or
precisely how to calculate such sum; (v) is authenticated by a Brazilian consulate in the country where the same was
issued or, if the judgment was issued in a jurisdiction that adopted the Hague convention abolishing the legalization
for foreign public documents, is apostilled; (vi) is accompanied by a sworn translation of the same into Portuguese;
and (vii) is not contrary to Brazilian national sovereignty, public policy and good moral character. The ratification
process may depend on the complexity of the case and/or defenses raised by the counterparty to challenge the request
of domestication.

Pursuant to the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code, foreign debt instruments do not need to be confirmed by the
Brazilian Superior Court of Justice to initiate a foreclosure proceeding in Brazil, provided that the foreign debt
instrument fulfills the legal requirements of the place where it was issued and indicates Brazil as the place of payment.

A plaintiff (whether Brazilian or non-Brazilian) who is incorporated outside Brazil or resides outside Brazil
during the course of judicial litigation in Brazil must provide a bond to guarantee court costs and legal fees whenever
such plaintiff owns no real property in Brazil that may ensure such payment. This bond must be sufficient to assure
payment of court fees and defendant’s attorneys’ fees, as determined by the Brazilian judge. The bond is not required
for foreclosure proceedings based on an extrajudicial title, for the enforcement of court decisions, for the filling of
counterclaims and in case an international treaty so releases.

**_Guarantees_**

Under Brazilian law guarantees may be either personal guarantees pursuant to which all of the assets of a
guarantor secure the guarantor’s obligations (but the assets are not linked to specific obligations and the creditors have
no preference over specific assets), or “in rem” guarantees (“security” under common law) pursuant to which only
certain specific assets are segregated to secure a specific obligation. The notes benefit from personal guarantee granted
by the Brazilian Guarantor. The validity and enforceability of guarantees granted by a Brazilian subsidiary are subject
to the effect of bankruptcy (falência), insolvency, judicial and out-of-court reorganization (recuperação judicial e
_extrajudicial), fraudulent transfer or any other law of general application limiting or affecting the enforcement of_
contractual or legal rights, and by the effect of general principles of Brazilian civil law, such as probity and good faith
and the social function of contracts and property.

A guarantee may be granted by a Brazilian Guarantor to guarantee obligations under the notes or the Indenture
and its enforcement, to the extent such guarantee is governed by a foreign law, will be subject to limitations and
requirements applicable to foreign agreements as mentioned above.

**_Insolvency issues_**

Under Brazilian Law, a debtor will be considered bankrupt whenever (i) such debtor fails, without legal reason,
to pay a debt which is represented by a protested enforceable instrument and exceeds the equivalent of 40 minimum
wages, the total of which currently equates to BRL 44,000.00 (forty four thousand Brazilian Reais); or (ii) foreclosure
proceedings are pending and one does not pay, deposit or appoint sufficient assets within the requisite legal term. A
debtor may also be considered bankrupt if (except if authorized under a judicial reorganization plan) it (i) sells its
assets in advance or resorts to ruinous or fraudulent means to make payments; (ii) performs (or tries to perform by


-----

unequivocal actions) a sham transaction or the disposal of part or all of its assets to a third party, aiming to delay
payments or defraud creditors; (iii) transfers its business unit without the consent of all creditors and does not maintain
sufficient assets to settle its liabilities; (iv) performs a fraudulent (sham) transaction to transfer its main place of
business to evade the law or overseeing authorities or to prejudice a creditor; (v) gives or increases security for an
existing debt and does not maintain sufficient free and clear assets to settle its liabilities; (vi) becomes absent without
leaving any competent representative with enough resources to pay the creditors; (vii) abandons its place of business
or tries to hide from its domicile, head office or main place of business; and/or (viii) fails to timely perform an
obligation due under a judicial reorganization plan. The debtor may also file a voluntary bankruptcy request,
submitting the required documents to the court, if it does not meet the requirements for filing a judicial reorganization.

Brazilian bankruptcy laws may be less favorable to creditors than those of certain other jurisdictions.
Noteholders may have limited voting rights at creditors’ meetings in the context of a court reorganization proceeding,
as explained below.

Any judgment obtained in Brazilian courts in respect of any payment obligations under the guarantee normally
would be expressed in the Brazilian Real equivalent of the foreign currency amount of such sum at the exchange rate
in effect (i) on the date of actual payment; (ii) on the date on which such judgment is rendered; or (iii) on the date on
which collection or enforcement proceedings are started against a Brazilian company. However, in the event of
bankruptcy, all of the Brazilian Guarantor’s obligations, including obligations arising from the guarantee under the
indenture or the notes, which are denominated in foreign currency, will be converted into Brazilian Reais at the
prevailing exchange rate on the date of declaration of the bankruptcy by the court. From that date on the amount in
Brazilian Reais will be adjusted by the Taxa Referencial or TR (reference rate), which is lower than the Brazilian
inflation rates.

**_Defrauding of creditors_**

Under the allegation of defrauding of creditors (fraude contra credores), a creditor, the creditors’ committee,
the judicial administrator and/or the public prosecutor may challenge transactions entered into by the Brazilian
Guarantor if there is evidence that (i) the insolvency of the Brazilian Guarantor was known at the time the transaction
was carried out, or should be known; and/or (ii) the transaction was carried out with the intention of defrauding
creditors, there was a fraudulent collusion between the Brazilian Guarantor and the third party involved in the
transaction; and the transaction caused effective damages to the insolvent estate of Brazilian Guarantor. In such a
situation, the transaction may be declared null and void, according to the provisions of Brazilian law.

In a bankruptcy scenario, the court can set aside certain transactions which take place up to 90 days from (as the
court decides) the bankruptcy request, the judicial recovery request or the first protest against the debtor due to failure
of payment (“Suspect Period”), regardless of whether the debtor intended to defraud creditors or the third party to
the transaction knew of the debtor’s financial difficulties. These transactions include (i) payments of debts that were
not due and payable carried out within the Suspect Period; (ii) payments made within the Suspect Period in a way
which differed from those set out in the relevant contractual agreement; and (iii) the granting of security to existing
debts. The court can also set aside, regardless of whether the debtor intended to defraud creditors or the third party to
the transaction knew of the debtor’s financial difficulties, (i) transactions for no consideration carried out within two
years before the declaration of bankruptcy; and (ii) the sale of the debtor’s business if the value of the debtor’s
remaining assets is insufficient to pay its debts and the consent of unpaid creditors has not been obtained, unless they
have been properly notified of the sale and have not opposed it within 30 days. Also, the transactions entered into by
the debtor may be made null and void if practiced to defraud creditors.

**_Procedural fraud_**

Under the allegation of procedural fraud (fraude à execução), a creditor may challenge transactions entered into
by the Brazilian Guarantor involving disposal or encumbrance of assets essentially if, at the time the transaction took
place, (i) the asset was subject to pending claim filed with the relevant public registrar; (ii) there was a pending
foreclosure procedure filed in the record of the asset; (iii) there was a judgment lien or other judicial restriction,
originating from the proceedings in which the fraud was claimed, filed in the record of the asset; (iv) there was a
pending claim against the Brazilian Guarantor that could lead it to insolvency. In such case, it is not necessary for the
creditor to produce evidentiary support of the fraud (neither guilt, nor evidence of intention), which may be presumed
under special circumstances. It is also not necessary for the creditor to file a separate claim against the debtor as well:


-----

the transaction will simply be disregarded by the judge in charge of the case, according to the provisions of the
Brazilian Civil Procedure Code. However, prior to declaring the procedural fraud, the judge must notify the thirdparty acquiring the asset, who is authorized to file a third-party motion to stay the execution within 15 days.

**_Formal procedures for insolvency_**

The main types of formal procedures available for companies in financial difficulties are (i) out-of-court
reorganization (recuperação extra-judicial); (ii) judicial reorganization (recuperação judicial); and (iii) bankruptcy
(falência). Brazilian bankruptcy law provides that some credits are excluded from judicial and out-of-court
reorganization proceedings (such as State tax and some fiduciary credits) and the measures (before courts or not) taken
by the respective holders are not subject to staying effects.

**_Out-of-court reorganization_**

The out-of-court reorganization is a private settlement between the debtor and its creditors and which, despite
the name, must be submitted to court to be ratified and to become enforceable. All creditors are free to enforce their
rights, adopting the proper procedures. Under out-of-court proceeding, shareholders and directors keep the control
and management of the company. Debtor and creditors settle the conditions for payment of the debts, and the
reorganization plan is submitted to the court for homologation. Creditors may file challenges to the plan, but there are
no specific legal provisions related to credit claims (habilitação de crédito) for out-of-court reorganization.

**_Judicial reorganization_**

Upon filing of a request for judicial recovery and consequent acceptance of it by the court, certain creditors are
refrained from enforcing their rights. Brazilian bankruptcy law provides for a stay period of up to 180 days, that may
be exceptionally extended for the same period once, provided that the debtor has not contributed to the delay. During
the stay period, the creditors cannot bring or continue any legal or foreclosure proceedings against the debtor, except
for those creditors which relate to tax claims, employment claims, claim that have a fiduciary claim to the underlying
asset, lessors, owners or committed sellers of real estate where the relevant agreement includes an irrevocability or
irreversibility clause; and claims that have retention of title clauses or are beneficiaries of forward exchange
agreements (however, these creditors cannot sell or remove assets which are deemed as essential by judicial ruling for
the debtor’s activities during the stay period). After such period, without approval of a reorganization plan, creditors
are entitled to submit an alternative proposal to the plan filed by the debtor. This alternative proposal must be voted
by a creditors committee in accordance to the terms and quorums established by the Brazilian bankruptcy legislation.
Shareholders and directors also keep the control and management of the company, but may be removed if certain
requirements are met. A court appointed administrator (administrador judicial) will supervise the administrators’ acts
in order to guarantee that they will comply with the legal requirements.

The commencement of judicial and out-of-court reorganization does not have the effect of terminating the
company’s contracts. Nevertheless, the reorganization plan is able to terminate and/or amend the conditions of those
contracts. For judicial reorganization proceedings, the debtor must present a list of creditors, classified according to
the legal standards, including (i) labor credits; (ii) secured credits; (iii) unsecured credits; and (iv) credits held by
micro and small enterprises (a class provided in Complementary Law No. 147, dated August 7, 2014) as each of those
classes of creditors vote separately in the approval of a reorganization plan. Creditors that were not listed by the debtor
are entitled to claim for inclusion (credit qualification). Creditors that disagree with the amount or classification in the
list are entitled to claim for correction (correction request). On judicial recovery, all credits should be paid as
established in the approved reorganization plan.

For the approval of the reorganization plan at a creditors’ general meeting, two requirements must be met: (i) in
the classes of secured and unsecured creditors, the plan must be approved by more than 50% of the creditors attending
the meeting both by amount of claims and number of creditors (on a headcount basis); and (ii) in the classes of labor
claims and small enterprises, by more than 50% of creditors attending the meeting (on a headcount basis), regardless
of the amount of their claims. The Brazilian bankruptcy law also grants the debtor the possibility to cram down the
reorganization plan, in the event that the requirements described above are not met. The cram down is only possible
if (i) at least 50% of the creditors attending the meeting voted favorably for the approval of the reorganization plan;
(ii) the plan is approved by three classes of creditors; or, in the event that there are only three classes of creditors, at
least two classes of creditors approved the plan; or, in the event that there are only two classes of creditors, at least


-----

one class approved the plan; (iii) one-third of the creditors attending the meeting in the rejecting class voted favorably
for the approval of the plan (such one third can be either based on the amount of claims and/or number of creditors,
depending on the class), and (iv) the reorganization plan does not provide for an unfair treatment of the class of
creditors which has rejected the plan. The reorganization plan results in the replacement and renewal of all credits
existing prior to the filing of the reorganization, which will be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
approved reorganization plan, and is binding on the debtor and all creditors subject to it, although it does not affect
guarantees provided by third parties which are not part of the reorganization proceeding.

Once the reorganization plan has been approved, the debtor will remain under the judicial reorganization
proceeding for a maximum period of two years, during which debtor’s failure to comply with any obligations set forth
in the plan will result in the conversion of the judicial reorganization into a bankruptcy liquidation proceeding.
However, in many cases, courts allow the debtor to seek approval of an amendment to the plan at a creditors’ meeting,
in order remedy any breaches to the provisions of the plan which may have occurred. In similar fashion, failure to
obtain approval of the reorganization plan from creditors or failure to secure court confirmation of the reorganization
plan will also result in the commencement of liquidation proceedings against such debtor.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Once the Bankruptcy claim (pedido de falência) is accepted and the bankruptcy decree is issued, judicial
measures filed by creditors must be stayed—and any claims will be submitted to the bankruptcy judge, which has
jurisdiction over the debtor assets (juízo universal).

Once the bankruptcy liquidation request (pedido de falência) is accepted and the bankruptcy liquidation decree
is issued, judicial measures filed by creditors must be stayed, and any claims will be submitted to the Bankruptcy
Court, who has jurisdiction over the debtor assets (juízo universal), subject to certain exceptions, including litigation
over tax claims and to those in which the estate figures as plaintiff or co-plaintiff.

When a company is bankrupt, the debts become due and payable, with a pro-rata deduction of interest, all foreign
currency claims are converted into Brazilian Real, the debtor is automatically prevented from exercising any business
activity and from managing or disposing of its assets, the court appoints a judicial administrator to manage the
bankruptcy, the judicial administrator collects the debtor’s property and assets, and values them, shareholders cannot
sell their estate shareholdings or otherwise withdraw from the company, if the value of the debtor’s assets is
insufficient to pay creditors no interest accrues on claims (except interest on debentures and secured claims, which
can be paid with the proceeds of sale of the underlying security) and agreements which the debtor entered into with
third parties do not terminate automatically. The judicial administrator may perform these agreements if certain
requirements are met.

For bankruptcy proceedings, there is a statutory order of preferences/privileges to be observed by the judge on
the payment of the credits. Brazilian law establishes the following order: (i) claims relating to employee contracts,
limited to 150 times the monthly minimum wage per employee, and on-the-job accidents; (ii) claims of creditors that
hold in rem security (up to the value of the assets given as security); (iii) federal, state and municipal tax claims,
excluding fines and credits excluded from the scope of the bankruptcy procedure; (iv) all other unsecured claims;
(v) contractual and public fines and penalties, including tax penalties; (vi) subordinated claims, including claims by
the debtor’s shareholders and managers which do not have an employment relationship with the debtor (when the
hiring has not been made under arm's length conditions and market practices); and (vii) interest accrued after the
bankruptcy procedure has commenced.

Additionally, some claims are not subject to the bankruptcy proceeding and shall be paid before the claims listed
in this paragraph, including:(i) expenses whose early payment is essential for the bankruptcy management; (ii) strictly
wage-related labor claims overdue within three months prior to the bankruptcy decree, limited to five minimum wages
per employee; (iii) amounts derived from debtor-in-possession loans; (iv) fees payable to the judicial administrator,
his assistants and the creditors’ committee (if applicable) and labor-related claims or occupational accident claims
referring to services rendered after the decree of bankruptcy; (v) obligations resulting from valid legal acts performed
during the judicial reorganization or after the bankruptcy decree; (vi) credit provided by the creditors to the bankrupt
estate; (vii) administrative expenses connected to management, asset realization and distribution of the proceeds, as
well as court costs of the bankruptcy proceeding; (viii) court costs with respect to actions and enforcement proceedings


-----

in which the bankrupt estate is defeated; and (ix) taxes which become due after the decree of bankruptcy.Nevertheless,
prior to the payment of the creditors mentioned in the paragraph above, the following post-commencement claims and
creditors shall be paid: (i) fees payable to the judicial administrator and his assistants and labor-related claims or
occupational accident claims referring to services rendered after the decree of bankruptcy; (ii) credit provided by the
creditors to the bankrupt estate; (iii) administrative expenses with schedules, management, asset realization and
distribution of the proceeds, as well as court costs of the bankruptcy proceedings; (iv) court costs with respect to
actions and enforcement proceedings in which the bankrupt estate is defeated; (v) obligations resulting from valid
legal acts performed during the judicial reorganization, such as _debtor-in-possession_ loans, or after the decree of
bankruptcy, and taxes which become due after the decree of bankruptcy.

In addition, claims secured by fiduciary assignments, as well as claims deriving from lease agreements or from
advances in foreign exchange agreements, among others, are entitled to restitution, and will not be affected by the
bankruptcy.

After the sale of the assets and the distribution of the proceeds amongst the creditors, and after the judicial
administrator submits a final report, the court will terminate the bankruptcy proceeding. The debtor will be discharged
from its obligations in the following cases: (i) payment of all claims in full; (ii) payment of more than 25% of the
unsecured claims, after all assets are sold; (iii) the lapse of 3 years following the decree of bankruptcy, except for the
assets collected before that time; or (iv) termination of the bankruptcy proceeding by the relevant judicial court. In
principle, debtor’s subsidiaries and affiliates are treated as separate entities and are not affected by the filing of a
judicial reorganization, an extrajudicial reorganization or a bankruptcy. As of December 2020, Brazilian law on
bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings expressly incorporated provisions allowing entities from the same
economic group to file request for joint judicial reorganization proceedings. The debtors that meet certain requirements
provided for in the Brazilian bankruptcy law (and that are part of a group under common corporate control) may
request judicial reorganization proceeding under procedural consolidation. With regard to substantial consolidation,
the relevant judge may authorize it, exceptionally, when there is interconnection and confusion between the assets or
liabilities of the debtors of the group of companies, in a way that it is not possible to identify their ownership. In such
case, there must be the occurrence of at least two of the following hypotheses: (i) existence of cross guarantees; (ii)
control or dependency relationship; (iii) total or partial identity of the corporate structure; and (iv) joint operation in
the market among the applicants.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the court may pierce the corporate veil of the debtor, or extend the effects of
bankruptcy to other entities, if there is evidence of fraud, misuse of corporate purpose and commingling of assets.

**_Participation of Noteholders on insolvency legal procedures_**

Courts in Brazil have taken different approaches regarding the representations of creditors of a bond or note
issuance in insolvency procedures. Some courts have admitted the representation of the holders of notes or bonds by
a trustee or agent while other have required the direct participation of the beneficial owner of the notes, sometimes
even considering the relevant note as independent credit.

**_Cross-border insolvency_**

As of December 2020, Brazilian law on bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings incorporated provisions of
the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency governing the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings
in Brazil and regulating international cooperation in the event of transnational insolvency.

According to the new rules on cross-border insolvency procedures, the main jurisdiction governing the
insolvency proceeding shall be that of the place where the debtor maintains the center of its main interests, whilst
other jurisdictions are ancillary. In a cross-border reorganization or bankruptcy proceeding, Brazilian courts must
cooperate with other jurisdictions, and foreign creditors are entitled to the same rights as Brazilian creditors.
