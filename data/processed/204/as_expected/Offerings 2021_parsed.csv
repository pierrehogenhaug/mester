204_1,Offerings 2021.md,1246,NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,1246.1,,1246.1.1,,"We refer to the terms “EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Free Cash Flow” and “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” in various places in this offering memorandum and in documents we incorporate by reference herein. These are supplemental financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP. Any analysis of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. _Novelis: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_ Novelis defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Novelis defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before (a) “depreciation and amortization”; (b) “interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs”; (c) “interest income”; (d) “unrealized gains (losses) on change in fair value of derivative instruments, net,” except for foreign currency remeasurement hedging activities, which are included in Adjusted EBITDA; (e) impairment of goodwill; (f) “(gain) loss on extinguishment of debt”; (g) noncontrolling interest's share; (h) adjustments to reconcile our proportional share of Adjusted EBITDA from non-consolidated affiliates to income as determined on the equity method of accounting; (i) “restructuring and impairment, net”; (j) gains or losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment and businesses, net; (k) other costs, net; (l) litigation settlement, net of insurance recoveries; (m) sale transaction fees; (n) “income tax provision (benefit)”; (o) cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax; (p) metal price lag; (q) “business acquisition and other integration related costs”; (r) purchase price accounting adjustments; (s) “income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (t) “loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax.” EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures commonly used in our industry, and we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are operating performance measures that measure operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. Our management believes investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these nonU.S. GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Many investors are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations from one period to the next and would ordinarily add back items that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of our business. By providing these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, together with reconciliations, we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing strategic initiatives. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: - do not reflect our cash expenditures or requirements for capital expenditures or capital commitments; - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and - do not reflect any costs related to the current or future replacement of assets being depreciated and amortized. We also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: - as measures of operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis because it removes the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations; - for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budgets and financial projections; - to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; and ----- - to calculate incentive compensation payments for our key employees. _Free Cash Flow_ Novelis defines Free Cash Flow as: (a) “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities - continuing operations,” (b) plus “Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations,” (c) plus “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities - discontinued operations,” (d) plus “Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - discontinued operations,” (e) plus cash used in the “Acquisition of assets under a capital lease,” (f) plus cash used in the “Acquisition of business, net of cash and restricted cash acquired,” (g) plus accrued merger consideration, (h) less “Proceeds from sales of assets and business, net of transaction fees, cash income taxes and hedging,” and (i) less “Proceeds from sales of assets and business, net of transaction fees, cash, income taxes and hedging - discontinued operations.” Management believes Free Cash Flow is relevant to investors as it provides a measure of the cash generated internally that is available for debt service and other value creation opportunities. However, Free Cash Flow is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily represent cash available for discretionary activities, as certain debt service obligations must be funded out of Free Cash Flow. In addition, our method of calculating Free Cash Flow may not be consistent with that of other companies. _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_ In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we give pro forma effect to (i) the Aleris Acquisition, (ii) the borrowing of $1.1 billion of term loans (the “Short Term Loans”) under the Short Term Credit Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2020 (the “Short Term Loan Credit Agreement”) by Novelis Holdings Inc. on April 14, 2020, (iii) the borrowing of $775 million of incremental term loans under our secured term loan credit agreement by Novelis Acquisitions LLC on April 14, 2020, (iv) the repayment of all of the outstanding indebtedness of Aleris (other than the indebtedness of its Chinese subsidiaries), (v) the payment of the fees and expenses relating to the Aleris Acquisition ((i) through (v), collectively, the “Aleris Transactions”) and (vi) this offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds” as if the Aleris Transactions and this offering had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period presented. Certain of these pro forma effects are based on estimates and assumptions, all of which we believe have a reasonable basis, although actual results could differ from those estimates and the assumed facts may not be realized. Please see footnote (3) in “Offering Memorandum Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial _Information of Novelis” included herein for a further discussion of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Aleris: Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA of Aleris is defined as net income and loss before interest income and expense, provision for and benefit from income taxes, depreciation and amortization and income and loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and excludes metal price lag, unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, restructuring charges, currency exchange gains and losses on debt, stock-based compensation expense, start-up costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment of amounts held in escrow related to the sale of the recycling business and certain other gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA of Aleris (“Aleris Adjusted EBITDA”) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Aleris Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by eliminating the impact of a number of items not considered indicative of Aleris’ ongoing operating performance and certain other items. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons our management considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. However, Aleris Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measurement recognized under U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing Aleris’ operating performance, investors should use Aleris Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income and loss, operating income and loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or in addition to, and not as an alternative for, cash flow from operating activities as a measure of Aleris’ liquidity. Aleris Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, Aleris’ measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These limitations include: ----- - it does not reflect Aleris’ cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; - it does not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments under Aleris’ outstanding indebtedness; - it does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Aleris; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies may calculate this measure differently and, as the number of differences in the way companies calculate this measure increases, the degree of its usefulness as a comparative measure correspondingly decreases. Please see “Offering Memorandum Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated _Financial Information of Novelis” for a further discussion of our use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow_ and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum, including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to our management and why it may be useful to investors, and a reconciliation of (i) our net income attributable to our common shareholder, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our Free Cash Flow, (iii) our pro forma net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and (iv) Aleris’ net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Aleris’ Adjusted EBITDA. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and public disclosures and press releases of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These rules require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner from non-U.S. GAAP liquidity measures; - adjustment of a non-U.S. GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to occur; and - presentation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures on the face of any pro forma financial information. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with these rules. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

204_1,Offerings 2021.md,233,SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,233.1,Aleris Acquisition,233.1.1,,"On April 14, 2020, we closed our acquisition of Aleris, a global supplier of rolled aluminum products. Aleris’ product portfolio ranges from the most technically-demanding heat treated plate and sheet used in mission-critical applications to sheet produced through its low-cost continuous cast process. Aleris possesses a combination of technically-advanced, flexible and low-cost manufacturing operations supported by an industry-leading research and development platform. Its facilities are strategically located to serve customers globally. Aleris’ diversified customer base includes a number of industry-leading companies. We believe its technological and R&D capabilities allow it to produce the most technically demanding products, many of which require close collaboration and, in some cases, joint development with customers. We expect the Aleris Acquisition to deliver a number of significant benefits by: - establishing a more diverse product portfolio, which will now include aerospace, beverage can, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation and specialty products; - integrating complementary assets in Asia to include recycling, casting, rolling and finishing capabilities and allowing Novelis to more efficiently serve the growing Asia market; and - leveraging Novelis’ deep manufacturing and recycling expertise to optimize Aleris’ assets and unlock valuable synergies. Aleris had revenues of $3,376 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $388 million and shipments of 858 kt for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the antitrust review processes in the European Union, the United States and China required for approval of the acquisition, we were obligated to divest Aleris' European and North American automotive assets, including its plants in Duffel, Belgium (“Duffel”) and Lewisport, Kentucky (“Lewisport”). On September 30, 2020, we completed the sale of Duffel to Liberty House Group through its subsidiary, ALVANCE, the international aluminum business of the GFG Alliance. Previously, the European Commission and ----- Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation determined that our acquisition of Aleris could proceed on the condition that we divest Duffel to a third party that met certain buyer suitability requirements. Both regulators approved ALVANCE as a suitable buyer. In November 2019, ALVANCE agreed to acquire Duffel for €310 million. At closing on September 30, 2020, we received €210 million in cash ($246 million as of September 30, 2020). The parties have agreed to a post-closing arbitration process regarding the payment of the remaining €100 million. There is no assurance as to when we expect the post-closing arbitration process to conclude and whether we will receive any of the remaining €100 million payment. On September 4, 2019, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed an action to block our acquisition of Aleris and contemporaneously announced an agreement with us to resolve the antitrust issues through binding arbitration. On March 9, 2020, the arbitrator assigned to resolve the dispute ruled in favor of the DOJ. As a consequence of that ruling, we were required to divest Lewisport. On August 21, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio appointed a divestiture trustee to oversee the sale of the Lewisport plant and make a recommendation to the DOJ regarding a buyer. On November 6, 2020, the DOJ notified us that American Industrial Partners (“AIP”) was approved as the acquirer of Lewisport. On November 8, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with AIP for the sale of Lewisport. For a discussion of important factors that may impact the integration of Aleris into our operations, see “Part I, Item 1A.

204_1,Offerings 2021.md,535,COVID-19,535.2,,535.2.1,,"Beginning late in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and carrying into the current fiscal year, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its unprecedented negative economic implications, have affected production and sales across a range of industries around the world. Our global operations, similar to those of many other large, multi-national corporations, were also impacted. Early in fiscal year 2021, we were required to partially shut down or temporarily close certain facilities in the United States and abroad to comply with state orders and governmental decrees and adjust schedules at some of our facilities based on customer demand. The plant shut downs and adjusted schedules resulting from COVID-19 resulted in disruptions to our supply chain, interruptions to our production, and delays of shipments to our customers, mainly during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. While much of our customer demand and shipments recovered in the majority of our end markets during the second fiscal quarter and remained robust in the third fiscal quarter, the overall extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and financial condition will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our customers, employees, and vendors. We believe this will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state, and local governmental responses. As of December 31, 2020, we had available liquidity of $2,390 million, which consisted of $1,164 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,226 million in remaining availability under committed credit facilities. For a further discussion of the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our operational and financial performance, see “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic—Our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers and customers, may be adversely affected by public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.”_ Our application of U.S. GAAP requires the pervasive use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference. The global COVID-19 pandemic has required greater use of estimates and assumptions. More specifically, those estimates and assumptions that are utilized in our forecasted cash flows form the basis in developing the fair values utilized in impairment assessments as well as annual effective tax rate. This has included assumptions as to the duration and severity of the pandemic, timing and amount of demand shifts amongst sales channels (primarily in the automotive industry), workforce availability, and supply chain continuity. We have experienced short-term disruptions and ----- anticipate that such disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future, but we also anticipate an eventual return to normal demand. Although we have made our best estimates based upon current information, the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on our business may result in future changes to our estimates and assumptions based on its duration. Actual results could materially differ from the estimates and assumptions developed by management. If so, we may be subject to future impairment charges as well as changes to recorded reserves and valuations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Certain adjustments were made to factor in the effects of the Aleris Transactions on the statement of operations and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. These adjustments include the following: a. The elimination of Aleris’ historical depreciation and amortization expense, and the recognition of new depreciation and amortization expense; b. An adjustment to interest expense for the removal of historical interest expense and the addition of interest expense related to debt issued as part of the Aleris Transactions, as well as this offering and the application of the use of proceeds therefrom; c.

The outbreak of such a communicable disease could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread across the globe to many countries in which we do business and impacted worldwide economic activity. A public health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that have been requested and mandated by governmental authorities, or that such crisis may otherwise interrupt or impair business activities. Additionally, as a result of the Aleris Acquisition, we expect to derive future revenues from customers in the aerospace end-use market. Due to severe impacts from the global COVID-19 pandemic, demand for air travel declined dramatically in 2020, resulting in airline capacity reductions. Consequently, we have experienced a significant decline in orders from aerospace customers, which has negatively impacted our business. While it is not possible to predict the impact that a global health crisis could have on our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, the measures taken by the governments of countries affected, actions taken to protect employees, and the impact of any such crisis on various business activities in affected countries could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

As a holding company, the Parent conducts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Consequently, cash flow and the ability to service debt obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our obligations under the Parent Guaranty, are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and joint ventures and the distribution of those earnings, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these entities to the Parent or any restricted subsidiary. The ability of these ----- entities to pay dividends or make other loans, advances or payments to the Parent or any restricted subsidiaries will depend upon their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt, and the Parent may not exercise sufficient control to cause distributions to be made to the Parent. Although the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures governing the notes currently outstanding and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby each limit the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to enter into consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Parent or any of its restricted subsidiaries, these limitations do not apply to the Parent, its existing joint ventures or unrestricted subsidiaries and the limitations are also subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The ability of the Parent’s restricted subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our obligations under the Parent Guaranty, will depend on their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control.

For example, as of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds,” the notes and the related guarantees would have effectively ranked junior to our $2,041 million of secured debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities, which is secured by the Parent’s assets and the assets of its principal subsidiaries, including the Issuer. Although the indenture that will govern the notes contains restrictions on the Parent’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to create or incur liens to secure indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to important limitations and exceptions that permit us to secure a substantial amount of additional indebtedness.

Accordingly, the Issuer may not be able to satisfy its obligations to repurchase the notes unless the Issuer is able to refinance or obtain waivers under the senior secured credit facilities. The Issuer’s failure to repurchase the notes upon a change of control triggering event would cause a default under the indenture that will govern the notes and a cross default under the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the currently outstanding notes. Also, the Issuer cannot assure you that a repurchase of the notes following such a change of control triggering event would be permitted pursuant to any of our indebtedness agreements that would be in effect at the time of such change of control triggering event, which could cause our other indebtedness to be accelerated. The senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. If we cannot obtain a waiver of such default or seek to refinance such indebtedness, this could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any future indebtedness agreement may contain similar provisions.

Certain limitations contained in the guarantees, which are designed to avoid this result, may render the guarantees worthless.","The notes will be guaranteed by the Parent and a number of the Parent’s subsidiaries. We note that, generally, with respect to guarantees of the obligations of an issuer, whether direct or indirect, applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and financial assistance laws of the relevant jurisdictions may limit the remedies of noteholders against guarantors. Federal, state and foreign statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void or subordinate the notes or any or all of the subsidiaries’ guarantees of the notes. If the notes or any guarantees are voided or subordinated, our noteholders might be required to return payments received from the Issuer, the Parent or the subsidiaries. The criteria for application of such fraudulent conveyance and other statutes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but, in general, under United States federal bankruptcy law, comparable provisions of state fraudulent conveyance laws, the notes or a guarantee could be set aside or subordinated if, among other things, the Issuer or the guarantor, as applicable, at the time the notes were issued or the guarantor provided the guarantee: - incurred debt represented by the notes or the guarantee with the intent of hindering, defeating, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or of giving one creditor a preference over others; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for incurring the notes or the guarantee, and - was insolvent, on the eve of insolvency, or was rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of the notes or the guarantee; - was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which the assets remaining with it constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on such business; - conducted itself in a manner that was oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly disregarded the interests of creditors and certain other interested parties; - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured; or - was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages entered against it, if, in either case, after final judgment the judgment was unsatisfied. Under Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws and comparable provincial laws on preferences, fraudulent conveyances, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transactions, the payment of money, disposition of property, incurrence of an obligation, or provision of services to a creditor or other person can be challenged as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction. The tests to be applied under these Canadian laws vary, but as a general matter, these challenges may arise in circumstances where: - an entity is found to be insolvent at the time it issued a note or provided a guarantee; - an entity was rendered insolvent by issuing a note or providing a guarantee; - a note was issued, or a guarantee was provided, within a specified period of time prior to the commencement of proceedings under Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation and the consideration received by the insolvent note issuer or guarantor was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the consideration given by the note issuer or guarantor; - an insolvent note issuer or guarantor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor or such action was taken with a view to giving such a creditor a preference; ----- - holders of notes, or beneficiaries under guarantees, were not dealing at arm’s length with an insolvent issuer or guarantor and the obligation incurred had the effect of giving such holders of notes, or beneficiaries under guarantees, a preference; or - a note issuer or a guarantor is found to have acted in a manner that was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly disregarded the interests of, any shareholder, creditor, director, officer or other interested party. Although varying by jurisdiction, generally, a court might find that the issuer of the notes did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes and did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes to the extent that the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used to make a distribution to the issuer’s shareholders. In addition, a court might find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of its guarantee. As a general matter, value is given for an obligation if, in exchange for the obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. The definition and test for insolvency will vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, was greater than its assets at fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became absolute and matured; or - it could not pay or has ceased paying its debts generally as they become due. In general, a Canadian court would deem an entity insolvent if: - it is for any reason unable to meets its obligations as they generally become due; - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due; or - the aggregate of its property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all of its obligations, due and accruing due. The tests for preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction, including the criteria for insolvency, will vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied. We cannot be sure which tests and standards a court would apply to determine whether or not the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the tests and standards, whether the issuance of the notes or the guarantee would be voided or subordinated to our or the guarantor’s other debt. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or incurrence of the guarantee was a preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction or should be set aside on other grounds, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the issuer or the related guarantor, as the case may be, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. Also, a Canadian court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or guarantees to other claims against the issuer and/or guarantors if the court determines that: - the holder of notes or beneficiary of the guarantee engaged in some form of inequitable conduct; - the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the notes or beneficiaries of the guarantees; and ----- - such subordination is not inconsistent with applicable laws. A court may also impose substantive consolidation, or variants thereof, on insolvent debtor company estates (provided certain criteria are met), and this may impair your ability to collect payment in full under the notes and the guarantees. Each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. However, this provision may automatically reduce the guarantor’s obligations to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless and, in any case, this provision may not be effective to protect a guarantee from being avoided under fraudulent transfer laws. For example, in a Florida bankruptcy case, a similar provision was found to be ineffective to protect similar guarantees. Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or custodian (Sachwalter) may challenge (anfechten) transactions (Rechtsgeschäft) or acts (Rechtshandlungen) that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Your rights under the notes and the guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and substantial delays in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, and other laws of the respective guarantors’ jurisdictions of incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another and those of Canada and the United States, including creditors’ rights and remedies, priority of creditors, priority claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding.

Although we will submit to the jurisdiction of certain U.S. federal and New York state courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, holders of the notes may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers.

Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Germany. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

Neither the Issuer nor the initial purchasers will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euro or in converting other currencies into euro to facilitate the payment of the purchase price for the notes. An investment in any security denominated in, and all payments with respect to which are to be made in, a currency other than the currency of the country in which an investor in the notes resides or the currency in which an investor conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s home currency”), entails significant risks not associated with a similar investment in a security denominated in the investor’s home currency. In the case of the notes, these risks may include the possibility of: - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the investor’s home currency. We have no control over a number of factors affecting the notes and foreign exchange rates, including economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, as well as economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries and the extent of governmental surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance. The exchange rates of an investor’s home currency for euro and the fluctuations in those exchange rates that have occurred in the past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations therein that may occur in the future. Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would result in a decrease in the investor’s home currency equivalent yield on a note, in the investor’s home currency equivalent of the principal payable at the maturity of that note and generally in the investor’s home currency equivalent market value of that note. Appreciation of the euro in relation to the investor’s home currency would have the opposite effects. The EU or one or more of its Member States may, in the future, impose exchange controls and modify any exchange controls imposed, which controls could affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of euro at the time of payment of principal of, interest on, or any ----- redemption payment or additional amounts with respect to, the notes. In addition, there may be tax consequences to you as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses from any investment in the notes. See “Certain Tax _Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” if you are a U.S. holder of the notes whose_ functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, the indenture and the notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes would be required to render the judgment in euro. However, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, and we cannot predict how long this would take. A federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the notes would apply the foregoing New York law. In courts outside New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be rendered in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euro into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment and when the judgment is rendered. This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in securities, including, in particular, the notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an investor’s home currency.

As of December 31, 2020, no amount of the Term Loan Facility is due within one year. In January 2017, the Parent borrowed $1.8 billion of term loans (the “2017 Term Loans”) under the Term Loan Facility. The 2017 Term Loans mature on June 2, 2022 and are subject to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments. The 2017 Term Loans accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.85% per annum. In April 2020, Novelis Acquisitions LLC borrowed $775 million of term loans (the “2020 Term Loans”) under the Term Loan Facility immediately prior to its merger into Aleris. The proceeds of the 2020 Term Loans were used to pay a portion of the consideration payable for the acquisition of Aleris (including the repayment of certain indebtedness of Aleris) as well as fees and expenses related to the acquisition and the 2020 Term Loans. The 2020 Term Loans mature on January 21, 2025 and are subject to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments. The 2020 Term Loans accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum. On March 11, 2021, the Parent obtained commitments to borrow $500 million of term loans (the “2021 Term Loans”) under the Term Loan Facility, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent. The Parent expects to borrow the 2021 Term Loans on or about March 31, 2021. The 2021 Term Loans will mature on or about March 31, 2028 and will be subject to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments. The 2021 Term Loans will accrue interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. The proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan will be applied to refinance $500 million of the 2017 Term Loans. Immediately after giving effect to such refinancing, $633 million of 2017 Term Loans, $769 million of 2020 Term Loans and $500 million of 2021 Term Loans will be outstanding. The Term Loan Facility requires customary mandatory prepayments with excess cash flow, asset sale and casualty event proceeds and proceeds of prohibited indebtedness, all subject to customary exceptions. The loans under the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid, in full or in part, at any time at our election without penalty or premium. The Term Loan Facility allows for additional term loans to be issued under the Term Loan Facility in an amount not to exceed $300 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) plus an unlimited amount if, after giving effect to such incurrences on a pro forma basis, the senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.00 to 1.00. The Term Loan Facility also allows for additional term loans to be issued under the Term Loan Facility to refinance existing term loans under the Term Loan Facility, subject to customary terms and conditions. The lenders under the Term Loan Facility have not committed to provide any such additional or refinancing term loans. In August 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver to permit the amendment to our Short Term Loan Credit Agreement described below and to modify certain other credit agreement terms to increase our operating flexibility. On March 5, 2021, we amended the ABL Revolver to permit assignments of loans and commitments to US branches of certain non-US banks. In April 2019, we amended and extended the ABL Revolver (the “ABL Amendment”). The commitments under the ABL Revolver were increased from $1 billion to $1.5 billion on October 15, 2019 pursuant to the terms of the ABL Amendment. Aleris and certain of its subsidiaries became borrowers under the ABL Revolver upon closing of the Aleris Acquisition, and the ABL Amendment included additional changes to facilitate the Aleris Acquisition and increase our operating flexibility. The ABL Revolver is a senior secured revolver bearing an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25% to 1.75% or a prime rate plus a prime spread of 0.25% to 0.75% based on excess availability. The ABL Revolver has a provision that allows the facility to be increased by an additional $750 million, subject to lenders providing commitments for the increase. The ABL Revolver has various customary covenants including maintaining a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1 if excess availability is less than the greater of (1) $115 million and (2) 10% of the lesser of (a) the maximum size of the ABL Revolver and (b) the borrowing base. The ABL Revolver matures on April 15, 2024; provided that, in the event that the Term Loan Facility or certain other indebtedness is ----- outstanding 90 days prior to its maturity (and not refinanced with a maturity date later than October 15, 2024, then the ABL Revolver will mature 90 days prior to the maturity date for such other indebtedness, as applicable; unless excess availability under the ABL Revolver is at least (i) 20% of the lesser of (x) the total ABL Revolver commitment and (y) the then applicable borrowing base and (ii) 15% of the lesser of (x) the total ABL Revolver commitment and (y) the then applicable borrowing base, and a minimum fixed charge ratio test of at least 1.25 to 1 is met. The senior secured credit facilities contain various affirmative covenants, including covenants with respect to our financial statements, litigation and other reporting requirements, insurance, payment of taxes, employee benefits and (subject to certain limitations) causing new subsidiaries to pledge collateral and guarantee the loans and other obligations secured in connection with such credit facilities. The senior secured credit facilities also include various customary negative covenants and events of default, including limitations on our ability to (1) incur additional indebtedness, (2) sell certain assets, (3) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (4) make investments, loans and advances, (5) pay dividends or returns of capital and distributions beyond certain amounts, (6) engage in mergers, amalgamations or consolidations, (7) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and (8) prepay certain indebtedness. The term loan credit agreement also contains a financial maintenance covenant that, prohibits our senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter period and measured on a rolling four quarter basis from exceeding 3.50 to 1.00, subject to customary equity cure rights. The senior secured credit facilities include a crossdefault provision under which lenders could accelerate repayment of the loans if a payment or non-payment default arises under any other indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of more than $100 million (or, in the case of the Term Loan Facility, under the ABL Revolver regardless of the amount outstanding). The senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by the Parent’s direct parent, AV Metals Inc., and certain of the Parent’s direct and indirect subsidiaries and subject to certain specified exceptions are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the guarantors under the senior secured credit facilities. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants in the Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the outstanding 2017 Term Loans, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereof. See “Use of Proceeds.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The Short Term Loan Credit Agreement provided commitments of certain financial institutions for $1.1 billion of Short Term Loans that were funded on the closing date of the Aleris Acquisition. The proceeds of the Short Term Loans were used to pay a portion of the consideration payable for the acquisition of Aleris (including the repayment of certain indebtedness of Aleris and its subsidiaries) as well as fees and expenses related to the acquisition and the Short Term Loans. The Short Term Loans are unsecured, were originally scheduled to mature on April 13, 2021, are not subject to any amortization payments, and originally accrued interest at LIBOR (as defined in the Short Term Loan Credit Agreement) plus 0.95%. The Short Term Loans are guaranteed by the same entities that have provided guarantees under the Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver. In August 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Short Term Loan Credit Agreement to extend the maturity from April 13, 2021 to April 13, 2022, increase the interest rate if the Short Term Loans remained outstanding past April 13, 2021 and require the grant of a junior-ranking security interest, subject to the terms of our existing intercreditor agreement if the Short Term Loans remained outstanding past April 13, 2021. The Short Term Loan Credit Agreement contains voluntary prepayment provisions, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default substantially similar to those under the Term Loan Facility, other than changes to reflect the unsecured and short term nature of the Short Term Loans. The Short Term Credit Agreement contains mandatory prepayment provisions related to debt and equity proceeds, asset sales, casualty losses, and condemnations, subject to certain reinvestment rights and exceptions.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected ----- by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Any Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes that is transferred as described in this paragraph will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the 144A Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Regulation S Global Note to which it was transferred. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below. Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder of such Notes, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer. The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196
204_1,Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.7,Ranking,21.7.1,,"The Notes will: - be senior, unsecured obligations of the Issuer; - be effectively junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt of the Issuer (including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing that debt; - be equal in right of payment (pari passu) with all existing and future unsecured senior debt of the Issuer; - be structurally junior to debt of non-guarantors; - be senior in right of payment to all future subordinated debt of the Issuer; and - be guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by the Guarantors. A significant portion of the Company’s operations are conducted through the Company’s other Restricted Subsidiaries. Therefore, the Issuer will depend substantially on the cash flows of the other Restricted Subsidiaries to service the Notes. Because a significant portion of the Company’s operations are conducted through the Issuer and the other Restricted Subsidiaries, the Company’s performance of its obligations under the Parent Guaranty will depend substantially upon the cash flows of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including the Subsidiary Obligors), as well as the ----- ability of the Subsidiary Obligors to distribute those cash flows to the Company as dividends, loans or other payments. _See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—The Parent is primarily a holding _company and is dependent on its subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations, including the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and our obligations under the Parent Guaranty.” Certain laws_ restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make loans and advances to it. The Company’s ability to use the cash flows of those subsidiaries to fulfill its obligations under the Parent Guaranty will be limited to the extent of any such restrictions. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, bankruptcy, “fraudulent conveyance” laws or other similar laws could invalidate or limit the efficacy of the Subsidiary Guaranties. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—Fraudulent conveyance laws and other legal doctrines may permit courts to void or subordinate the notes or the guarantees of the notes in specific circumstances, which would prevent or limit payment under the notes or the guarantees. Certain limitations contained in the guarantees, which are designed to avoid this result, may render the guarantees worthless.” Any of the situations described above could_ make it more difficult for the Company to service its debt, including its obligations under the Parent Guaranty and the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes. Except to the extent of any intercompany loans or other advances, the Company only has a stockholder’s claim in the assets of its subsidiaries. Its rights as a stockholder are junior in right of payment to the valid claims of creditors of the Company’s subsidiaries against those subsidiaries. Holders of the Notes will only be creditors of the Issuer, the Company and those subsidiaries of the Company that are Subsidiary Guarantors. In the case of subsidiaries of the Company that are not Subsidiary Obligors, all the existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors and preferred stockholders, will effectively rank senior to the Notes. As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to this offering and the application of net proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the Company and its subsidiaries had $11,260 million in total consolidated debt and other liabilities, of which $9,517 million was debt and other liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiary Obligors and $1,743 million of which was debt and other liabilities of the Company’s other subsidiaries. The Company and the Subsidiary Obligors and the Company’s other subsidiaries have other liabilities, including contingent liabilities, that may be significant. The Indenture will limit the amount of additional Debt that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur. Notwithstanding these limitations, the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Obligors, may Incur substantial additional Debt. Debt may be Incurred either by the Subsidiary Obligors or by the Company’s other subsidiaries. The Notes and the Guaranties are unsecured obligations of the Subsidiary Obligors and the Parent Guarantor, respectively. Secured Debt of the Subsidiary Obligors and the Parent Guarantor, including their obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, will be effectively senior to the Notes and the Guaranties to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Debt. As of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to this offering and the application of net proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the outstanding secured Debt of the Company and the Subsidiary Obligors on a consolidated basis was $2,041 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

See “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.” Each Subsidiary Guarantor’s liability under its Subsidiary Guaranty will be limited to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture and the Notes or (ii) the amount, if any, which would not have (1) rendered the Subsidiary Guarantor “insolvent” (as such term is defined in the Federal Bankruptcy Code and in the Debtor and Creditor Law of the State of New York) or (2) left it with unreasonably small capital at the time its Subsidiary Guaranty with respect to the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture and the Notes was entered into, after giving effect to the incurrence of existing Debt immediately before such time. The liability of each existing or future Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty will also be subject to the limitations applicable under local law, including limitations related to corporate interest, insolvency, minimum capital requirements, financial assistance and fraudulent conveyances. For example, the liability of each of Novelis Deutschland GmbH, Aleris Deutschland Holding GmbH, Aleris Rolled Products Germany GmbH and Aleris Casthouse Germany GmbH under its Subsidiary Guaranty will be limited to the extent that such entity’s net assets (Eigenkapital) may not fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) as a result of the enforcement of the Subsidiary Guaranty, that such an enforcement must not result in a breach of the prohibition of insolvency causing intervention (Verbot des _existenzvernichtenden Eingriffs) or that such an enforcement must not deprive such entity of the liquidity necessary_ to fulfill its financial liabilities to its creditors to the extent provided for by law. With respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors organized under Swiss law, namely, Novelis AG and Novelis Switzerland S.A., the liability of each such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty will be limited to the maximum amount of its profits and reserves available for distribution. Similar limitations may apply with respect to Subsidiary Guarantors in other jurisdictions. The Subsidiary Obligors currently generate most of the Company’s consolidated net sales and own most of its consolidated assets. The subsidiaries of the Company that will not be Subsidiary Obligors following the consummation of this offering represented the following approximate percentages of (a) net sales, (b) EBITDA and (c) total assets of the Company, in each case, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Aleris Transactions and this offering and the application of net proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds:” - 25.1% of the Company’s consolidated net sales are represented by net sales to third parties by subsidiaries that are _not_ Subsidiary Obligors under the Indenture (for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020); - 17.9% of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA is represented by the subsidiaries that are _not Subsidiary Obligors under the Indenture (for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020); - 15.7% of the Company’s consolidated assets are owned by subsidiaries that are _not_ Subsidiary Obligors under the Indenture (as of December 31, 2020). If the Company or a Subsidiary Obligor, sells or otherwise disposes of either: (1) its ownership interest in a Subsidiary Guarantor, or (2) all or substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, then the Subsidiary Guarantor so sold or disposed of will be released from all of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty without any further demand. In addition, if, consistent with the requirements of the Indenture, the Company designates a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an ----- Excluded Subsidiary in accordance with the definition of “Excluded Subsidiary”, the designated Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty.

Any notice to holders of Notes of such redemption shall include the appropriate calculation of the redemption price, but need not include the redemption price itself.

However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under “—Change of Control Offer” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.” The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, exchange offer, in open market purchases, through negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with ----- applicable securities laws, upon such terms and at such prices as the Issuer or its Affiliates may determine, which may be more or less than the consideration for which the Notes offered hereby are being sold and may be less than the redemption price then in effect and could be for cash or other consideration.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196
204_1,Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.17,Change of Control Offer,21.17.1,,"Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (in denominations of €100,000 or any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control _Offer”) at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,_ plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the repurchase date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer shall: (a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Triggering Event to be sent at least once to the Dow Jones News Service or similar business news service in the United States; and (b) send by first-class mail or electronic delivery, with a copy to the Trustee, to each holder of Notes at such holder’s address appearing in the security register, a notice stating: (1) that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control Offer” and that all Notes timely tendered will be accepted for payment; (2) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the repurchase date, which shall be, subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically to the holder of Notes; (3) the circumstances regarding the Change of Control Triggering Event; and (4) the procedures that holders of Notes must follow in order to tender their Notes (or portions thereof) for payment, and the procedures that holders of Notes must follow in order to withdraw an election to tender Notes (or portions thereof) for payment. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Purchase Price and has purchased all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer is made, in which case no Change of Control Offer will be required to be made after the related Change of Control Triggering Event. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of such compliance. For so long as the Notes are listed the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. ----- The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers of the Notes. The Company and the Issuer have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Company or the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Debt are contained in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation _on Debt.” Such restrictions can be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the_ Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” the Property of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, if the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, dispose of less than all this Property by any of the means described above, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes may be uncertain. In such a case, holders of the Notes may not be able to resolve this uncertainty without resorting to legal action. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide that certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control would also constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and entitle the lenders under those facilities to require that such debt be repaid. The indentures governing our Existing Notes provide, and other future debt of the Company may provide, that the occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control will require such debt to be repurchased or repaid. Moreover, if holders of Notes exercise their right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes, the Issuer could be in breach of obligations under existing and future debt of the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. The Issuer cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s failure to repurchase Notes, as required following a Change of Control Offer, would result in a Default under the Indenture. Such a Default would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other existing debt of the Company and may constitute a default under future debt as well. The Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes. See “—Amendments and Waivers.” In connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such offer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, so long as such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to a Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the price offered to each other holder in such offer (which, if the offer is not a Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, may be less than par and may consist of non-cash consideration) plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

In the event that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any Suspension Period, and, subsequently, the applicable Rating Agency (or both Rating Agencies) withdraws its or their ratings or downgrades the ratings assigned to the Notes below the required Investment Grade Ratings or a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will from such date (the “Reinstatement Date”) and thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants. No Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reinstatement Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. On the Reinstatement Date, all (i) Debt Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the date of the Indenture, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (k) of the second paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Limitation on Debt” and (ii) all Liens incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred under clause (j) of the definition of “Permitted Liens.” The amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be determined as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Board of Directors will not be entitled to designate any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary during a Suspension Period unless the Board of Directors would have been entitled to designate such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if the Suspension Period had not been in effect for any period.

The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Available Cash (the “Advance _Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”)._ To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase the Notes (subject to applicable Euroclear and Clearstream procedures as to Global Notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining net proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such net proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Within five Business Days after the Issuer is obligated to make an Asset Sale Offer as described in the preceding paragraph, the Issuer shall send a written notice, by first-class mail or electronic delivery, to the holders of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, accompanied by such information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as the Issuer in good faith believes will enable such holders to make an informed decision with respect to such Asset Sale Offer. Such notice shall state, among other things, the purchase price and the repurchase date, which shall be, subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

A Default under clause (3) or clause (4) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding notify the Issuer in writing by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time ----- specified after receipt of such notice.

In case an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, arrangement, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Issuer shall occur, such amount with respect to all the Notes shall be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration is obtained by the Trustee, the registered holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, premium, Additional Amounts or interest, have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture.

In addition, any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such holder to the Company and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee evidence stating that the Company has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred and the Trustee shall be deemed to have not received the Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Event of Default. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes unless either (1) with respect to any payment default a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default or (2) a written notice of such Default or Event of Default shall have been given to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect. The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate (“flat tax regime”) for certain investment income and, in particular, interest income on the part of German tax resident private investors. By law of December 12, 2019 (Gesetz zur Rückführung des Solidaritätszuschlags 1995) the German legislator has decided on a partial repeal of the solidarity surcharge starting as of the year 2021, which shall effectively benefit lower and middle income individual taxpayers. However, the solidarity surcharge remains in place for purposes of the withholding tax, the flat tax regime and the corporate income tax.

However, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, you will be required to determine the U.S. dollar amount realized by translating the euro received at the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If you are an accrual basis U.S. Holder and you receive euro on the disposition of a note, your amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount received (other than amounts received upon the disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), calculated at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the disposition. As an alternative, if you are an accrual basis U.S. Holder and the notes are traded on an established securities market, you may elect to determine the U.S. dollar amount realized by translating the euro received (other than amounts received upon the disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest) at the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If you make this election you must apply such election consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year and you cannot change the election without the consent of the IRS. In any case where the amount realized is based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the disposition, you generally will be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference (if any) between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount realized based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount realized based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date. If you pay the purchase price for a note in euro, your tax basis in the note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot exchange rate in effect on such date. You will be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss (if any) attributable to a change in exchange rates between the date of your purchase of a note and the date of your disposition of the note. Gain or loss attributable to a change in exchange rates will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of your euro purchase price for the note determined based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date that the note is disposed of (or possibly, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, in the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder, at the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of your euro purchase price for the note determined based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date that you acquired the note. The realization of foreign currency gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued interest, in the aggregate, will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the note.

Your tax basis in euro received as interest on, or on the disposition of, a note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof determined at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date you received the euro. Upon any subsequent conversion or other disposition of the euro for U.S. dollars, you generally will be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference (if any) between the amount of U.S. dollars that you receive and your tax basis in the euro.

Consequently, subject to a number of complex limitations and conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement), you may be able to benefit from the foreign tax credit for that German income tax. Otherwise, your capital gain or loss generally will be U.S. source gain or loss for foreign tax credit purposes, and if your gain from the disposition of a note is subject to withholding of German income tax you may not be able to benefit from the foreign tax credit for that income tax (i.e., because the gain from the disposition would be U.S. source), unless you can apply the credit against U.S. federal income tax payable on other income from non-U.S. sources.

For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a note that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - a citizen or an individual who is a resident of the United States; - a corporation created or organized in, or under the laws of, the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of the source of that income; or - a trust, if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions, or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a “United States person.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The initial purchasers must purchase all the notes if they purchase any of the notes. The purchase agreement also provides that if an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may also be increased or the offering may be terminated. The initial purchasers propose to resell the notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The price at which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the notes through their affiliates. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify an order of the notes in whole or in part. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” ----- In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. We have agreed that, for a period of 30 days from the date of this offering memorandum, we will not, without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan AG and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by us. J.P. Morgan AG and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in their sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes. We estimate that our portion of the total expenses of this offering will be $        . In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases. - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. - Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-thecounter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. In addition, affiliates of some of the initial purchasers are lenders, and in some cases agents or managers for the lenders, under our Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolver. In particular, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Axis Bank Limited, Singapore Branch, BofA Securities Europe, BNP Paribas, Barclays Bank Ireland plc, Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, DBS Bank Ltd, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., ING Bank N.V., J.P. Morgan AG, MUFG Securities (Europe) N.V., Société Générale, Standard Chartered Bank, SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Europe, Wells Fargo Securities Europe S.A., or their respective affiliates, are joint lead ----- bookrunners and joint lead arrangers for one or more of the various facilities under our senior secured credit facilities and certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders thereunder. Standard Chartered Bank acted as a lender and as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Term Loan Facility. Additionally, an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers is acting as trustee with respect to the notes. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the 2017 Term Loans and as a result will receive proceeds from the offering. Axis Bank Limited and First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC. If an initial purchaser is not a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, it may not make sales of any notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, and will only do so through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers, or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and an initial purchaser or any affiliate of that initial purchaser is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by that initial purchaser or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer (as defined in this Offering Memorandum) in such jurisdiction. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, ING Bank N.V. and Standard Chartered Bank will not effect any offers or sales of any notes in the United States unless it is through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the regulations of FINRA. Although DBS Bank Ltd. is not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, DBS Bank Ltd., as a non-U.S. financial institution, may engage in a limited range of securities activities including underwriting and other participation in offerings in the United States pursuant to exemptions from broker-dealer registration including those set forth in Rule 15a-6 of the Exchange Act. We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (the “CCAA”) contain provisions enabling an insolvent person to obtain a stay of proceedings against its creditors and others and to prepare and file a proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement, as the case may be, to be voted on by the various classes of its affected creditors. A proposal or plan, if accepted by the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors, and if approved by the relevant Canadian court, would be binding on all creditors within each affected class whether or not such creditor voted to accept the proposal or the plan. There is no certainty that previously accrued rights or interests of creditors, including the noteholders, will be enforced by the Canadian court or included in any such proposal, plan or in a distribution order. The determination of how claims will ultimately be treated, as well as how each class of affected claims will be settled, including payment terms, if applicable, in restructuring proceedings cannot be made until the Canadian court has approved a proposal, plan or a distribution order. There is no assurance that any such proposal or plan will be sanctioned by the Canadian court or that any such proposal or plan will be implemented successfully. Moreover, in the context of a restructuring, Canadian Insolvency Legislation permits the insolvent debtor to retain possession and administration of its property, subject to court oversight, even though it may be in default under the applicable debt instrument during the period in which the stay of proceedings remains in place. The powers of the court under Canadian Insolvency Legislation and particularly under the CCAA, are exercised broadly to protect an insolvent person or debtor and its estate from actions taken by creditors and others. The Court has pervasive equity powers when applying this legislation and the exercise of judicial discretion may depend on future-arising facts and the circumstances and the nature of insolvency proceedings, generally. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the notes would be made during any proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring proceeding, whether or when the trustee for the notes could exercise its rights under the notes indentures or whether, and to what extent, holders of notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the trustee for the notes. Typically, the stay of proceedings would prevent payments from being made under the notes or the guarantees and the trustee from exercising its rights while the insolvent company is under court protection.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The tests to be applied under these Canadian laws vary, but as a general matter, these challenges may arise in circumstances where: - an entity is found to be insolvent at the time it issued a note or provided a guarantee; - an entity was rendered insolvent by issuing a note or providing a guarantee; ----- - a note was issued, or a guarantee was provided, within a specified period of time prior to the commencement of proceedings under Canadian Insolvency Legislation and the consideration received by the insolvent note issuer or guarantor was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the consideration given by the note issuer or guarantor; - an insolvent note issuer or guarantor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor or such action was taken with a view to giving such a creditor a preference; - holders of notes, or beneficiaries under guarantees, were not dealing at arm’s length with an insolvent issuer or guarantor and the obligation incurred had the effect of giving such holders of notes, or beneficiaries under guarantees, a preference; or - a note issuer or a guarantor is found to have acted in a manner that was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly disregarded the interests of, any shareholder, creditor, director, officer or other interested party. - In general, a Canadian court would deem an entity insolvent if: - it is for any reason unable to meets its obligations as they generally become due; - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due; or - the aggregate of its property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all of its obligations, due and accruing due. Also, a Canadian court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or guarantees to other claims against the issuer and/or guarantors if the court determines that: - the holder of notes or beneficiary of the guarantee engaged in some form of inequitable conduct; - the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the notes or beneficiaries of the guarantees; and - such subordination is not inconsistent with applicable laws. A Canadian court may also impose substantive consolidation, or variants thereof, on the estates of insolvent debtor companies forming part of the same corporate group (provided certain criteria are met), and this may impair your ability to collect payment in full under the notes and the guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office, in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company which are at least partially listed in the whereas of the EU Insolvency Regulation, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office, and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main interests” may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are public collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of such Member State, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of such Member State has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him or her by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition; (B) should a guarantee be granted by a French Guarantor which is a subsidiary of the Issuer, a guarantee limitation amount would apply corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering of the notes applied by the Issuer for the direct or indirect benefit of that French Guarantor through any intercompany loans and/or cash pooling arrangements to that French Guarantor or its subsidiaries and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made under the guarantee. Accordingly, the obligations and liabilities of a French Guarantor under its guarantee shall be limited, at any time, to the proceeds of the notes (if any) made available by the Issuer to such French Guarantor and/or any subsidiaries of such French Guarantor (if any) under intercompany loan or cash pooling arrangements or similar arrangements, in each case to the extent such loans are outstanding to the French Guarantor and/or its subsidiaries at the time when a payment is required under the guarantee, it being specified that any payment made by a French company under this guarantee shall automatically reduce _pro tanto_ the outstanding amount of the relevant intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French company to the parent company or its subsidiaries. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its guarantee; and (C) the obligations and liabilities of a French company for the obligations of any obligor which is its subsidiary will cover all amounts due by such obligor as borrower under any applicable finance document and as obligor (the “Guaranteed Obligor”). However, where such Guaranteed Obligor is not incorporated in France, the amounts payable by the French company under this paragraph (C) in respect of the obligations of the Guaranteed Obligor as guarantor, shall be limited as set out in paragraph (B) above. For the avoidance of doubt, any obligations or liabilities that may arise from a French company acting jointly and severally with other guarantors (including, as applicable, as _co-débiteur solidaire) are subject always to the limitations set out in the preceding paragraphs. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances. French courts could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French Guarantor did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a whole. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit as regards a French Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. French case law has recognized that certain intragroup transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the relevant company, particularly if the following four criteria are fulfilled: - the existence of a genuine group of companies (taken as a whole, not just its shareholders) operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective; - the existence of a common economic, social or financial interests of the group within the framework of a policy implemented by the group of companies; ----- - the transaction shall not be without due consideration and compensation and shall not change the existing balance between the respective obligations of the relevant affiliates; and - the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit. The French Guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee and the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee shall not exceed its financial capability. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the French Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Although each of these French Guarantors has appointed an agent for service of process in the United States, these French Guarantors and the Issuer have been advised that there is a doubt that a foreign judgment based upon U.S. federal or state securities law would be enforced in France. Such French Guarantors and the Issuer have also been advised that there is a doubt that a lawsuit based upon U.S. federal or state securities law could be brought in an original action in France. The United States and France are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in commercial matters and, with respect to France, awards rendered in the United States civil matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter as the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such courts, the choice of the U.S. courts is not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdictions over the matter; - the court that has rendered such judgment has applied a law that would have been considered as applicable and/or appropriate under French rules of international conflicts of laws; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case including the defense rights; - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with French judgment or a foreign judgment which has become effective in France and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial, or technical nature to foreign authorities), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified several times and as last modified by law No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France and from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. ----- Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes French international public policy. Further, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (Article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to recent case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent.

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third-party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative, the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: - the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; - the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and - at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the notes may not enjoy the benefit of the guarantees and the value of any consideration that holders of the notes received with respect to the notes could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

If the answer is satisfactory and the doubts are removed, the procedure stops there. If the auditor does not receive a satisfactory response, the second step is taken. - Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures, the auditors can request that a board of director's (or supervisory board) meeting be convened.

Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of _conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of creditors’ counsel relating to such proceedings are deemed_ null and void with respect to the portion of such fees above a proportion fixed by order of the Minister of Justice (currently: seventy-five percent of the fees). While the conciliation agreement (whether acknowledged or approved) is being implemented, by law: (i) any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims governed by the conciliation agreement are suspended, (ii) accrued interests of the claims governed by the conciliation agreement cannot bear themselves interests and (iii) the debtor retains the right to petition the President of the Court who opened conciliation proceedings for debt rescheduling (pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code mentioned above) in relation to creditors (other than public creditors) who were called to the conciliation with respect to their claims which are not governed by the conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord appointed to supervise the performance of the restructuring agreement, if the conciliator has been appointed in such capacity and taking into account the actual performance of the restructuring agreement by the debtor. A third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle) can benefit from the grace periods granted to the debtor during conciliation proceedings as well as from the provisions of the approved or acknowledged agreement (Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code). In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for its termination. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, to the exception of those amounts already paid to them. Conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of participating creditors has been sought to prepare the disposal of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to implementing such sale (plan de cession) in subsequent insolvency proceedings. To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such conciliation proceedings. Finally, conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the thresholds required for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196
204_1,Offerings 2021.md,1250,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,1250.3,France,1250.3.9,Safeguard Proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde),"The safeguard proceedings allow for the establishment of a restructuring plan negotiated with the creditors under court supervision before the company becomes insolvent. It is available only at the request of a debtor company. The objectives of safeguard proceedings are to facilitate the debtor’s reorganization in order to safeguard the debtor’s activity and employment and to pay creditors. The debtor must be solvent (i.e., not unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets) (absence d’état de cessation des paiements) but experiencing difficulties that it cannot overcome. Safeguard proceedings are public and include an automatic stay of all actions against the debtor for up to six months, renewable for an additional six months with court approval and which can be extended, under exceptional circumstances, to a maximum of 18 months upon request of the public prosecutor. During that observation period, which may last up to 18 months, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire), whose name can be suggested by the debtor, investigates the business of the company and helps the company to elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde). During the safeguard proceedings, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the opening of the proceedings are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The bankruptcy judge can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’s ordinary activities or are required by the proceedings must be paid as and when they fall due, and if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings. ----- One of the main features of the safeguard proceedings consists in the creation of two creditors’ committees (mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding €20 million, and whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a certified public accountant (expert comptable), optional below such thresholds), one of banks and financial institutions (or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor) and the other of suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers, as well as a general meeting of note holders (comprising all holders of all notes or bonds issued by the company even if they relate to different issues and regardless of the law applicable to each issue), in the event the concerned debtor would have issued bonds or notes, to which the debtor submits proposals to reach agreement on a recovery plan. The debtor’s management, together with the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of drafting the plan which will be voted by the committee(s) and the general meeting of noteholders as the case may be. Additionally, each member of the credit institutions’ committee and each member of the suppliers’ committee may propose an alternative safeguard or reorganization plan, which will have to obtain the support of all committees and general meeting of noteholders, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, the noteholders are not entitled to propose such a plan. The committees must accept or reject proposals for a safeguard plan within a minimum of 15 days of having received such proposals. For each committee, the plan is approved by such committee, where the members voting in favor of the plan account for at least two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the committee members expressing a vote. The amounts of the claims secured by a trust (fiducie) constituted as a guarantee granted by the debtor are not taken into account. In addition, creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of their repayment schedule or provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not take part in the vote. In cases where bonds or notes have been issued by the relevant French company, the plan, if approved by the committees, is then submitted to the general meeting of note holders where it is also approved by a majority of twothirds of the outstanding claims of the note holders expressing a vote. In respect of voting rights in both committees and general meeting of note holders, each creditor member of a creditors’ committee and each note holder must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its vote or providing for the full or partial payment of its claim by a third party, as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to the concerned creditor/note holder a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the relevant creditors’ committee or general meeting of note holders. In the event of a disagreement, the concerned creditor/ note holder or the courtappointed administrator may request that the matter be decided by the president of the commercial court in summary proceedings. Those creditors whose repayment terms are not affected by the draft safeguard plan, or for which the draft plan provides for full repayment in cash upon approval of the plan or admission of their claims, will not vote in the framework of the creditors’ committees or the general meeting of noteholders, as applicable. The committees and the general meeting of note holders, if any, must vote on the plan within six months from the date of the judgment opening the proceedings. If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved within these six months, this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. The plan submitted to the committees and the note holders, if any, may include not only a rescheduling of debts but also cancellation of debts and debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). In that respect it should be noted that (i) if the plan provides for a capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off with their claims against the debtor, as reduced as the case may be according to the provisions of the plan, (ii) if the court empowers the court-appointed administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in order to take corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s by-laws (including modifications of its share capital) required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights. The plan may provide for a different treatment of creditors if the differences in their situation so justify. The plan submitted to the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders must take into account intercreditor subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings. ----- Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of note holders, if any, and subject to verification by the court that creditors’ interests are adequately preserved, the court can approve the plan, in which case the plan will be binding on all creditors and noteholders (including those who did not vote or who voted against the adoption of the plan). Creditors who are not members of committees and who are not noteholders are consulted on an individual or collective basis. For those individual creditors with whom an agreement has not been reached with respect to the payment of their claim, the court can reschedule repayment of their claims over a maximum period of 10 years, with the exception of debts with maturity dates exceeding the duration of the plan, in which case their maturity dates remain the same. The court cannot oblige such creditors to waive any part of their claim. The first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be at least 5% of the total admitted pre-filing liabilities (except for agricultural businesses)). The court can also impose a plan if one or both of the committees, or the general meeting of noteholders, does not approve a plan, either by failing to vote within the specified six-month period (which may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator, to the extent it does not exceed the duration of the observation period) or by rejecting the plan. In such a case, the rules are the same as those applicable to creditors who are not members of the committees and who are not noteholders (creditors are consulted on an individual or collective basis and, in particular, the court can only impose a rescheduling of the repayment of the debts over a maximum period often years, with the exception of debts with maturity dates exceeding the duration of the plan, in which case their maturity dates remain the same). Finally, at any time during safeguard proceedings, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into reorganization proceedings (i) at the request of the debtor company, the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, if the company was already in _cessation des paiements at the opening of the proceedings, (ii) upon its own initiative or upon request of the debtor_ company, the court-appointed creditors’ representative, the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, if the company becomes insolvent or (iii) at the debtor’s request or upon request of the court-appointed administrator, the court-appointed creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor (if no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, by the noteholders’ assembly (as described below)), it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and the company would shortly become insolvent should the safeguard proceedings be ended. The court may also convert safeguard (provided the debtor is insolvent) or reorganization proceedings into liquidation proceedings if recovery of the debtor is manifestly impossible.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings is roughly similar to the regular safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard proceedings. Therefore some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims made by owners benefiting from retention of title clauses are, for instance, excluded by law. Trade creditors are involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings. Where accelerated safeguard proceedings are opened, the credit institution committee, the trade creditors’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the minimum period of 15 days from delivery of the proposed plan (as applicable in safeguard proceedings). As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings may notably provide for rescheduling of debts (provided that the concerned creditors have agreed to such rescheduling), debt cancellation, or debt-for-equity swaps (requiring the relevant shareholder consent). The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months. If, during this period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities of the creditors’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders, the court shall terminate the accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is similar to that applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings, which are now designed as the common “accelerated proceedings” whereas the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings are designed to “fast-track” safeguard proceedings dealing with purely financial difficulties. The key difference between accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is that the latter relate only to debts owed to financial institutions and noteholders (i.e., debts towards credit institutions that are eligible members of the credit institutions’ committee and debts towards noteholders which are eligible members of the general meeting of noteholders described above), which are subjected to an automatic stay and dealt with under the safeguard plan. The company continues to trade normally while the proceedings are pending, thus reducing significantly the impact of such safeguard proceedings on operational companies. Other classes of creditors, such as suppliers or public creditors, are not therefore affected by the proceedings. The same conditions mentioned above for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings also apply to a debtor eligible for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, provided that the accounts of the debtor offer evidence that a plan prepared in the context of conciliation proceedings is supported by a large majority of those financial creditors who will be affected by the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as indicated in the preceding paragraph), and is likely to be adopted within the duration of the procedure (i.e., one month from the opening judgment of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). The content of the safeguard plan and conditions of its adoption are the same as in accelerated safeguard proceedings, except that the credit institutions’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a shortened minimum period of eight days of being notified of the proposed plan. The duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings must not exceed one month, unless the court decides to extend it by one additional month. If, during this period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities of the financial creditors and noteholders (the same majority rules apply as in committees in regular safeguard proceedings), the court shall terminate the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and may not impose any uniform debt rescheduling on creditors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the court (in very limited cases only) or the public prosecutor. The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming in cessation des paiements_ unless it initiated conciliation proceedings within the same period. If it does not, its _de jure_ managers (including the directors) and, as the case may be, its de facto managers, are subject to civil liability. The aims of judicial reorganization proceedings are the same as those of safeguard proceedings. Most of the rules applicable to safeguard proceedings apply to judicial reorganization proceedings. In particular, the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings triggers an automatic stay of proceedings against the debtor for up to a maximum of 18 months (subject to the same limited exceptions). As with safeguard proceedings, the debtor’s management, together with the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of drafting the plan which will be voted on by the creditors’ committee(s) and the general meeting of noteholders, as the case may be. Additionally, each member of the committee(s) may propose an alternative reorganization plan (whereas noteholders may not). Committees of creditors and a general meeting of noteholders may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings (see above). The reorganization plan can combine all of the following: a debt restructuring, a re-capitalization of the company, a debt-for-equity swap (subject to relevant shareholder approval) and the sale of certain assets or of portions of the business. The plan may provide for a different treatment of creditors if the differences in their situation so justify. The plan submitted to the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders must take into account intercreditor subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings. In the case where the shareholders’ equity has not been restored to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code and the reorganization plan provides for a modification of the share capital in favor of one or more person(s) who undertake to comply with the plan, the courtappointed administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to vote in place of the dissenting shareholders if they refuse to vote such restoration (Article L. 631-9-1 of the French Commercial Code). In addition. Article L. 631-19-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that in the cases where (i) a debtor (a) employs more than 150 employees or (b) controls one or more companies employing in total more than 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of such debtor is likely to cause serious disturbance to the national or local economy and to local employment, and (iii) a share capital modification appears—after review of total or partial disposal plan solutions— the only credible solution to avoid such a disturbance and to allow the debtor’s business activities to continue, the court may, at the request of the insolvency administrator or the public prosecutor's office and at the end of a period of three months after the opening judgment, in the event of refusal by the meetings referred to in I of Article L. 631-19 to adopt the modification of capital provided for by the draft recovery plan in favour of one or more persons who have undertaken to implement the plan. In summary, if, in such event, a reorganization plan provides for a modification of the share capital in favor of one or more person(s) who undertake to execute the plan (e.g., the new majority shareholders) and the existing shareholders refuse to vote such share capital modification, the court may, under certain procedural and substantial conditions (e.g., the payment to the evicted shareholders of an amount corresponding to the value of their shares, as determined by a court-appointed expert if no agreement as to such value is reached among the parties) and upon request of the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, either (i) appoint a trustee to vote in favor of a ----- share capital increase in place of the dissenting shareholders or (ii) order, in favor of the person(s) who have undertaken to execute the plan, the transfer of all or part of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholders who own a majority of voting rights or hold a blocking minority in the company. Any approval clause is deemed null and void. If it appears the debtor is not able to ensure the recovery of its business, a total or partial sale of the business can be ordered by the court, at the request of the court-appointed administrator. In this case, the sale is conducted by the court-appointed representative of the creditors in accordance with rules applicable to the liquidation procedure.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The aim of these proceedings is to liquidate a company and end its activities, by selling its business, either as a whole or per branch of activity or asset by asset. The activity is ended from the opening of proceedings, except if a sale of all or part of the business is feasible. In such a case, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity during a maximum period of three months (renewable once) to implement such a sale. The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets (in cessation des paiements). The bankruptcy judge opens a judicial liquidation rather than a judicial reorganization when it considers that the debtor is unable to continue its business or that there are no serious chances of improving the company’s prospects through restructuring. Liquidation proceedings trigger an automatic stay of proceedings against the company. Secured creditors benefiting from a pledge are, however, where the law applicable to such security arrangements does not prohibit it, entitled to enforce their security interest through a court monitored allocation process (attribution judiciaire) (i.e., request the court to transfer ownership of the pledged asset(s)). The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings (i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets, or (ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Such period runs from the date on which the company is deemed to be unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets (in cessation des paiements) and can be backdated by the court up to 18 months before the judgment opening the relevant insolvency proceedings but not before the court order approving a conciliation agreement (homologation) Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Transactions that are automatically void if performed during the hardening period include transactions or payments that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include, notably, transfers of assets for no consideration or for nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the company significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, security granted for debts previously incurred and provisional measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates the date of _cessation des paiements), the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt incurred at the same time), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that dedicates assets or rights as a guarantee of pre-existing debts and a notarized declaration of non-seizability (déclaration d’insaisissabilité notariée) applying to any assets of the debtor during the “hardening” period. ----- Transactions that are voidable by the court include transactions or payments made when due after the date of _cessation des paiements, such as payments made on accrued debts, transfers of assets for consideration and notices of_ attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the “hardening period,” in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the company knew, or should have known, that it was in a state of cessation des paiements at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when realized during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the “hardening” period.

In the case where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors’ representative. When a proof of claim is made on behalf of a creditor, such creditor is allowed to ratify it or, if he wishes so, to replace it by filing its own proof of claim. Creditors who have not submitted their proof of claims during the relevant period are, except with respect to limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings and their unasserted claims are unenforceable against the debtor if the debtor complies with the plan’s provisions. Employees are not subject to such obligations and are preferred creditors under French law. From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings, the company is prohibited from paying debts outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially concern the set-off of inter-related debts (dettes connexes) and, provided that such payments are authorized by the court, payments made to recover assets required for the continued operation of the business. During this period, creditors may not pursue any legal action against the company with respect to any claim arising prior to the court order commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for or payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court fix the amount due); - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the company; or - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the company, except where such asset is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights _in rem_ of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations upon the opening of insolvency proceedings or the occurrence of a state of cessation des paiements are not enforceable under French law. The opening of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of the company’s obligations. If, however, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity because a sale of all or part of the business is feasible, the company’s obligations which have not yet arrived at maturity shall only mature as at the date of the judgment ordering such sale or upon expiry of the period of continued activity authorized by the court. The court-appointed administrator may elect to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform, or, on the contrary, to continue such contracts, and in the latter case can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the company may have been in default, provided that the company fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, that the debtor pays cash on delivery). ----- In the context of Accelerated Safeguard or Accelerated Financial Safeguard proceedings, the above rules would only apply to the creditors which are subject to the Accelerated Safeguard or Accelerated Financial Safeguard (see above).

Such main measures are: `o` Ordinance 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, entered into force as from 22 May 2020, which took the lead to first Ordinance 2020-341 dated 27 March 2020 and brought certain measures applicable to ongoing proceedings on 22 May 2020 until (depending of said measures) 31 December 2021 (initially until 31 December 2020 or 17 July 2021, and then extended by Law 2020-1525 entered into force as from 9 December 2020 (“Law 2020-1525”)) (the “Ordinance 2020-596”). Ordinance 2020-596 had also clarified certain transitional law issues applicable to Book VI of French Commercial Code. Application of Articles 1 to 6 of Ordinance 2020-596 has been extended until 31 December 2021 included (Article 124 of Law 2020-1525 for accelerating and simplifying public action (Accélération et Simplification de l’Action Publique). `o` In addition, Ordinance 2020-1443 dated 25 November 2020, entered into force as from 26 November 2020, regarding adaptation of insolvency to COVID-19 for ongoing proceedings initiated on or after 24 August 2020, as well as to those initiated as from 26 November 2020 until 31 December 2021, (the “Ordinance 20201443” and together with “Ordinance 2020-596”, the “Ordinances”) brought few complementary measures. Major themes of the Ordinances are: `o` effectiveness of conciliation proceedings (conciliation) were strongly increased, notably: `o` any conciliation proceedings (conciliation) may last ten (10) months; `o` simplification of communications by any means between the different parties to a conciliation proceeding (conciliation); `o` in case a creditor party to the conciliation negotiations refuses to suspend its due debt claims, the relevant debtor may ask the court's president (président du tribunal) to: - cancel, or prohibit such creditor to make, any claim against the debtor for any monetary payment; - stop, or prohibit, any execution or enforcement proceedings that may be raised by such creditor; and ----- - report/reschedule payments of any due debt; `o` creation of a so-called “post money privilege” in relation with safeguard (sauvegarde) and judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) proceedings, on a similar basis to the current exising “new money privilege” in conciliation; and `o` extension of the duration of ongoing safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) and reorganization plan (plan _de redressement judiciaire) up to a maximum of two (2) years._ `o` Law 2020-1525 dated 7 December 2020, entered into force on 9 December 2020, extends the material provisions of Ordinance 2020-596 until 31 December 2021 (“Law 2020-1525”).

204_1,Offerings 2021.md,1250,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,1250.4,Germany,1250.4.1,German Insolvency Law,"One or more of the guarantors of the notes and/or providers of a guarantee for the notes (together the “German Security Providers”) are incorporated in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of any such German company, subject to the statements made above under the heading “European Union” and that a relevant German Security Provider was held to have its center of main interests within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) was filed, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under German law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor. The debtor is over-indebted if its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich). The debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. If a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—“GmbH”) or any other kind of limited liability company gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company and, in certain circumstances its shareholders, are obliged to file for insolvency without delay, however, at the latest within three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, illiquidity, and/or within six weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason over-indebtedness, has occurred (the “Relevant Deadline”). Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both civil law damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness has occurred, the management of the insolvent company is generally not allowed to make any payments, including any payments under the note guarantees (unless such payments can be considered as having been made in the ordinary course of business (im ordnungsgemäßen Geschäftsgang), e.g. because they were required to maintain the business operation, and are made prior to the expiry of the Relevant Deadline). In addition, the debtor can file for insolvency proceedings if it is imminently at risk to be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Imminent illiquidity exists if the company is currently able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so within a prognosis period of the next 24 months. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obligated) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic certain provisions of German insolvency law have been temporarily suspended or relaxed: (i) First of all, the obligation of the management to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor was initially suspended until 30 September 2020 unless (x) the insolvency is not caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or (y) there is no prospect of resolving the insolvency. (ii) Secondly, corresponding payment prohibitions have been relaxed insofar as the conditions for the suspension of the duty to file for insolvency are met. The suspensions or relaxations under (i) and (ii) initially applied until 30 September 2020. The obligation to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) only (but not illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) was further suspended until 31 December 2020). Thereafter, the obligation to file for insolvency has only been further partially suspended in order to take account of delayed disbursements of ----- financial aid under a government relief program to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (“Corona Aid”). From 1 January until 30 April 2021 the obligation of the management to file for insolvency due to overindebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) has been suspended for debtors which applied for Corona Aid between 1 November 2020 and 28 February 2021, or which have omitted to apply for Corona Aid during that period for legal or factual causes but would be entitled to such Corona Aid, unless (y) the debtor has obviously no prospects of obtaining Corona Aid, or (z) the Corona Aid is not sufficient to remedy the insolvency. The periods for which the duty to file for insolvency has been suspended as set out above, hereinafter referred to as the “Suspension Period”. In addition, the forecast period relevant for determining as to whether the continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) (and the debtor is therefore not obligated to file for insolvency proceedings on the basis of over-indebtedness) is from 1 January 2021 until December 2021 shortened from the usual 12 months to a period of just four months, if the debtor's over-indebtedness resulted from the Covid19 pandemic. Insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings as far as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. As part of such protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for self-administration proceedings (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that no circumstances are known which lead to the expectation that self-administration will place the creditors at a disadvantage. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger _Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for self-administration, or on the profile of the (preliminary)_ insolvency administrator to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible, i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall include a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The rights and duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of main insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor) or illiquidity and/or overindebted and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. Otherwise, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be dismissed for insufficiency of assets. If insolvency proceedings are opened, the court usually appoints an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full power to dispose of the debtor’s assets, and the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) unless there is good cause for his replacement (wichtiger Grund), with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. As an exception, the court may order insolvency proceedings to be run by the relevant debtor itself under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter), in which case the relevant debtor retains, to a large extent, its authority to dispose of its assets. Such order remains subject to review and may be repealed in which case an insolvency administrator would be appointed. An insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseschulden) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor (including secured debt). ----- All creditors, whether secured or unsecured, (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) that wish to assert claims against the debtor in person need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor acquires through execution (i.e., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings. Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are not entitled to enforce their security interests after an insolvency petition has been filed to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral (though, between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence, such stay on enforcement requires a court order) but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this context it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any) and are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims— Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Accordingly, if a German Security Provider were to grant security over its assets to other creditors, such security may result in a preferred treatment of such secured creditors while the remaining assets may not be sufficient to satisfy the noteholders’ claims under the guarantee granted by such German Security Provider. In addition, it may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of the non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Following a recent amendment of German insolvency law, it is also possible to implement a debt-to-equity-swap through an insolvency plan. However, a creditor may not be forced into a debt-to-equity conversion if such creditor did not consent to the swap of its claims into equity of the relevant debtor. If the debtor has filed for the self-administration proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) and “protective shield” proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) due to over-indebtedness or imminent illiquidity the court will, upon request of the debtor, prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not evidently futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. During such period of preliminary insolvency proceedings, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which will be implemented in formal self-administration proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened (in case the court has ordered self-administration proceedings). The German insolvency laws have been subject to further amendments following the implementation of the EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) which was adopted on June 20, 2019. The EU Restructuring Directive was published on June 26, 2019 in the Official Journal of the European Union, from which date the member states will have approximately two years to implement the substantive parts of the EU Restructuring ----- Directive in their national legislation, although a one-year extension can be granted. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the EU Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization), but leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e., outside formal insolvency proceedings. The EU Restructuring Directive also provides for cross class cram down, i.e., even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement. On December 22, 2020 the German Bundestag passed the “Act on the further development of the Restructuring and Insolvency Law” (Sanierungs- _und _Insolvenzrechtsfortentwicklungsgesetz (SanInsFoG)) providing in particular for the implementation of the EU_ Restructuring Directive into German law by way of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG). In addition to the implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive, the SanInsFoG, _inter alia, also includes amendments to the provisions dealing with the managing director's obligation to file for insolvency proceedings, to the provisions relating to the managing director's liability for payments made by an insolvent company and to the procedure of self-administration (Eigenverwaltung). The SanInsFoG for the most part (including the StaRUG) entered into force on January 1, 2021 with a few remaining provisions to follow on January 1, 2022 and July 17, 2022, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital. The granting of guarantees by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable a GmbH to issue guarantees to secure guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice to subject such guarantee to a so called “limitation language.” Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees and secured parties agree to enforce the guarantee against the GmbH only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s net assets falling below its stated share capital or, if the net assets are already below its stated share capital, does not further reduce such amount. Accordingly, the documentation in relation to the guarantees, to the extent they concern a German Security Provider, contain such limitation language and, hence, such guarantees are limited in the manner described. The court decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of guarantees granted by the German Security Providers. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees by the German Security Providers. In addition, a managing director of a GmbH can be held liable pursuant to Section 15 b the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) for payments to the shareholders of the GmbH if such payments lead to the illiquidity of the GmbH. This provision may also be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of guarantees granted by the German Security Providers. Therefore, the above-mentioned “limitation language” may also include provisions which exclude the enforcement of a guarantee to the extent this would lead to the illiquidity of the GmbH. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to the insolvent debtor’s creditors as a whole and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the noteholders as well as granting them any security interest or guarantee, such as the guarantee granted in connection with the issuance of the notes. An administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions that have occurred up to ten years prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a transaction is successfully avoided, the noteholders would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received to the insolvency estate or to forfeit the guarantee. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the issuance of guarantees as well as the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction (i) if such act was performed during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) if such act was performed after the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction if (i) such act was performed during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors); - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if (i) it was entered into during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) it was entered into after such filing and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act whereby a debtor grants security (including guarantees) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years (or four years, if such act provided for security or satisfaction in favor of the other party) prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act; - any act that provides security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act occurred during the ten ----- years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii), in the case of satisfaction, the act occurred during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and - any act whereby the debtor satisfies for a loan payment claim or an economically equivalent claim of a third party if: (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the avoidance of certain acts (Rechtshandlung) or transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) have been temporarily suspended or relaxed. This includes, in particular, the repayment of a loan which was granted during an applicable Suspension Period (as defined above (i.e. the period during which the obligation to file for insolvency proceedings had been suspended in the specific case as set out above)) by 30 September 2023 and the provision of collateral to secure such loans during the Suspension Period which are not considered to be disadvantageous to the creditors; (this concept also applies to the repayment of new shareholder loans (but not to the collateralization of shareholder loans)). Furthermore, payments made on or before 31 March 2022 on claims for which an extension of payment was granted during an applicable Suspension Period before 28 February 2021 are considered not to be disadvantageous to the creditors provided that no insolvency proceedings were opened by 18 February 2021. In addition, if the prerequisites for the suspension of the obligation to file an application are met, congruent legal acts taken during the applicable Suspension Period are privileged in terms of avoidance in insolvency proceedings unless the opponent knew that the debtor's restructuring and financing efforts were not suitable for eliminating an illiquidity which had occurred. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor that has obtained an enforcement order but has failed to obtain full satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, has, under certain circumstances, the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of guarantees and security interests pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). In addition, a creditor who granted a loan or obtained security from a debtor in financial difficulties may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s insolvency or financial difficulty at the time security was granted. Under German law creditors risk becoming liable under Section 826 of the German Civil Code (i) for deceiving other creditors about the creditworthiness of the borrower thereby inducing other creditors to continue making business with the borrower and (ii) for causing a delay of an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings in order to obtain an advantage in the time gained. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security is close to financial collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. In connection with the German legislation dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also the before mentioned concepts have been relaxed in relation to the granting of new credit and collateral during the Suspension Period, which pursuant to such legislation shall not be regarded as a contra bonos mores contribution to a delay in the filing for insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The provision of a guarantee for the obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of cross-stream and upstream third party guarantees may be more problematic. Failure to comply with the above mentioned corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability of the directors of the Swiss company granting such third party guarantee. The question whether a third party guarantee granted in the absence of corporate interest could be held null and void is debated in legal doctrine. While some authors express the view that an absence of corporate interest could give rise to liability of the directors of the relevant company only, others consider that the consequences could be that the relevant obligations are null and void. Hence, in addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors of the Swiss company, a guarantee provided by the Swiss company could itself be held unenforceable, if it is seen to be contrary to public policy (ordre public) in case of facts establishing a misuse of corporate assets. Notwithstanding the above, the liabilities of any Swiss Guarantor under any up-stream or cross-stream guarantee are (to the extent that such is a requirement of applicable Swiss law in force at the relevant time) limited to a sum equal to the maximum amount of the Swiss Guarantor’s reserves and profits available for distribution as dividends at any given time, provided that such limitations shall not free the Swiss Guarantor from payment obligations in excess of its freely distributable reserves and profits, but merely postpone the payment date of those obligations until such time as payment is permitted notwithstanding such limitations. The payment under the respective guarantee and the enforcement of security interest may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. Moreover, the enforcement of the respective guarantee or any security interest granted may give rise to Swiss withholding taxes on dividends (of up to 53.8% at present rates) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such guarantee or security interest, respectively, falls to be regarded as a deemed distribution for Swiss withholding tax purposes. For the above reasons, it is standard market practice for guarantees made by Swiss Companies to contain socalled “limitation language” in relation to its guarantees limiting its liability to the maximum distributable amount.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any Canadian or U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on Canadian or U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland. A judgment of the Canadian or U.S. courts will be enforced by the Irish courts if the following general requirements are met: (i) the procedural rules of the Canadian or U.S. court must have been observed and the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending.

As one of the guarantors—Novelis Aluminium Holding Unlimited Company (the “Irish_ Guarantor”)—is an Irish incorporated company, the Irish Guarantor may be wound up under Irish law. On a liquidation of the Irish Guarantor, certain categories of preferential debts and the claims of secured creditors would be paid in priority to the claims of unsecured creditors. In particular: (i) under Irish law, the claims of creditors holding fixed charges may rank behind other creditors (namely fees, costs and expenses of any examiner appointed and certain capital gains tax liabilities) and, in the case of fixed charges over book debts, may rank behind claims of the Irish Revenue Commissioners for “pay-as-you earn”, pay related social insurance, local property tax and any tax imposed in conformity with the Council Directive of November 28, 2006 on the common system of value added tax (EC Directive 2006/112) and any other tax of a similar fiscal nature substituted for, or levied in addition to such tax whether in the European Union, or elsewhere in any jurisdiction together with any interest and penalties thereon; (ii) under Irish law, for a charge to be characterized as a fixed charge, the charge holder is required to exercise the requisite level of control over the assets purported to be charged and the proceeds of such assets including any bank account into which such proceeds are paid. There is a risk therefore that even a charge which purports to be taken as a fixed charge may take effect as a floating charge if a court deems that the requisite level of control was not exercised; and (iii) under Irish law, the claims of certain other creditors (including the Irish Revenue Commissioners for certain unpaid taxes), as well as those of creditors mentioned above, will rank in priority to claims of unsecured creditors and claims of creditors holding floating charges. If the Irish Guarantor becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the holders of the notes, the holders of the notes may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings. Under Irish insolvency law, a liquidator of the Irish Guarantor could apply to a court to have set aside certain transactions entered into by the Irish Guarantor before the commencement of liquidation, including the granting of a guarantee and any the payment of any amounts thereunder. Section 604 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014 (as amended) provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due, in favor of any creditor or person on trust for a creditor and where such act was done to give such creditor or any surety or guarantor for the debt due, to such creditor a preference over other creditors shall be deemed to be an unfair preference and will be invalid if (a) a winding up of the company commences within six months of doing the act; and (b) the company is at the time of the commencement of the winding up unable to pay its debts (taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities). Where the conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other action is in favor of a connected person the six-month period is extended to two years. In addition, any such act in favor of a connected person is deemed a preference over the other creditors and as such to be an unfair preference and invalid accordingly. Under section 608 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014 (as amended), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up to the satisfaction of the Irish High Court that any property of such company was disposed of and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on ----- the company, its creditors or members, the Irish High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable, order any person who appears to have “use, control or possession” of such property or the proceeds of the sale or development thereof to deliver it or pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the Irish High Court sees fit. In deciding whether it is just and equitable to make an order under section 608, the Irish High Court must have regard to the rights of persons who have bona fide and for value acquired an interest in the property the subject of the application. _Examinership. Examinership is a legal mechanism in Ireland for the temporary protection and potential_ rescue or reconstruction of an ailing but potentially viable Irish company. An Irish company, its directors, its shareholders holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of its voting share capital, or a contingent, prospective or actual creditor, are each entitled to petition the Irish High Court for the appointment of an examiner. While a company is in examinership, it may not be wound up, creditors may not enforce their claims or their security in respect of the company or its assets, and proceedings cannot be issued or potentially continued against it without the leave of the Irish High Court. Further, a company in examinership cannot discharge any liability incurred by it before the presentation to the Irish Court of the petition for examinership except in strictly defined circumstances. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to his appointment. Where possible, an examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement in respect of a company in examinership (the “Proposals”) which he/she believes will ensure the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. The Proposals will detail, among other things, how each class of creditor is to be treated in the context of the examinership and in particular the dividend, if any, they are to receive. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the Irish High Court when at least one class of creditors, whose interests are impaired under the proposals, has voted in favor of the proposals and the Irish High Court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by the implementation of the scheme of arrangement and the proposals are not unfairly prejudicial to any interested party. If, for any reason, an examiner was appointed to the Irish Guarantor while any amounts due under the notes were unpaid, the primary risks to the holders of the notes are as follows: - the trustee, on behalf of the holders of the notes, would not be able to take proceeding to enforce rights under the guarantee against the Irish Guarantor during the period of examinership; - a scheme of arrangement may be approved involving the writing down of the debt due by the Irish Guarantor to the holders of the notes irrespective of their views; - an examiner may seek to set aside any negative pledge given by the Irish Guarantor prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Irish Guarantor to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Irish Guarantor during the protection period; and - in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Irish Guarantor subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Irish Guarantor and approved by the Irish High Court) and the claims of certain other creditors referred to above (including the Irish Revenue Commissioners for certain unpaid taxes) will take priority over the amounts due by the Irish Guarantor to the holders of the notes. Furthermore, the Irish High Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed by the Irish High Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions set aside under section 604 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014 or section 608 of the Irish Companies Act, 2014.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

The DIFC is a federally decreed entity, which is limited to a specific geographical area within the Emirate of Dubai, and whose powers are specifically established by the Government of Dubai. Dubai is a member of the UAE, a federal Islamic state. The DIFC has a separate legal and judicial system that is independent from the Emirates of Dubai; and in accordance with the UAE Federal Law No. 8 of 2004, the federal civil and commercial laws of the UAE are not applicable to the DIFC. The DIFC regulatory bodies and courts oversee and govern all matters relating to and arising within the DIFC. However, all Emirates of the UAE apply UAE federal law to the extent that such legislation has been passed in relation to matters within the federal jurisdiction. The constitution of the UAE permits the Emirates to legislate on certain areas, however, only in the absence of such federal law or regulation will the domestic law of each Emirate and/or DIFC apply (except to the extent the applicability of the relevant federal law has been excluded by a federal decree). Notwithstanding the independent nature of the legal and judicial system of the DIFC, it still sits within the geographical area of the Emirate of Dubai. Therefore, the laws of the DIFC are subject to the constitution of the UAE (the “UAE Constitution”). The UAE Constitution provides at Article 7 that “Shari’a shall be a main source of _legislation in the Union”. In addition, the Civil Code provides at Article 2 that the “rules and principles of Islamic jurisprudence shall be relied upon in the understanding, construction and interpretation of these provisions”. The_ interpretation and application of _Shari’a_ is a matter of opinion and debate, and may be subject to differing interpretations by Islamic scholars, _Shari’a_ supervisory and advisory boards and the courts. Although legislative jurisdiction remains with the member Emirates in all matters not assigned to the UAE federal government, Shari’a could in theory be held to apply in respect of matters governed by the DIFC law. The field of conflict of laws is not well developed in the UAE. Under Article 151 of the UAE Constitution, the provisions of the UAE Constitution prevail over the constitutions of the Emirates, and the federal laws which are issued in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution have priority over the legislation, regulations and decisions issued by the authorities of each of the Emirates. In the event of conflict, that part of the inferior (Emirate) legislation which is inconsistent with the superior (federal) legislation should be rendered null and void to the extent that this removes the inconsistency. In case of dispute, the matter will be referred to the Federal Supreme Court for its ruling. In case of a dispute between the legislation and jurisdiction of the Emirates of Dubai and the DIFC, the matter will be referred to the Joint Judicial Committee for its ruling. The legal system within the DIFC is based on the English common law. However, given that it is a relatively new jurisdiction with a somewhat untested legal framework and limited judicial precedents, there remains a degree of uncertainty as to how the relevant provision of the DIFC law would be applied by a DIFC Courts. The DIFC Law No. 10 of 2004 – DFIC Court Law allows the courts of the DFIC to consider decisions of the other courts. The DIFC courts often look at the English law and other common law precedents for guidance, but these precedents only have persuasive value and are not binding on the courts of DIFC. In the event insolvency proceedings were to occur in relation to Novelis MEA Ltd., the guarantor will be subject to the following legislation: (i) DIFC Companies Law, DIFC Law No. 5 of 2018 (the “Companies Law”); and ----- (ii) DIFC Insolvency Law, DIFC Law No. 1 of 2019 (the “Insolvency Law”) and the DIFC Insolvency Regulations (the “Insolvency Regulations”), which together govern insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Judgments by non-Brazilian courts may be enforced in Brazil without reconsideration of the merits, by ratification of that judgment by the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (Superior Tribunal de Justiça). That confirmation generally will be available if the foreign judgment: (i) fulfills all formalities required for its enforceability under the laws of the country where the foreign judgment is granted; (ii) is issued by a competent court after proper service of process (whereby service of process instituted against a Brazilian resident party is effected in accordance with Brazilian law); (iii) is final and therefore not subject to appeals; (iv) provides for the payment of sum certain or precisely how to calculate such sum; (v) is authenticated by a Brazilian consulate in the country where the same was issued or, if the judgment was issued in a jurisdiction that adopted the Hague convention abolishing the legalization for foreign public documents, is apostilled; (vi) is accompanied by a sworn translation of the same into Portuguese; and (vii) is not contrary to Brazilian national sovereignty, public policy and good moral character. The ratification process may depend on the complexity of the case and/or defenses raised by the counterparty to challenge the request of domestication. Pursuant to the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code, foreign debt instruments do not need to be confirmed by the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice to initiate a foreclosure proceeding in Brazil, provided that the foreign debt instrument fulfills the legal requirements of the place where it was issued and indicates Brazil as the place of payment. A plaintiff (whether Brazilian or non-Brazilian) who is incorporated outside Brazil or resides outside Brazil during the course of judicial litigation in Brazil must provide a bond to guarantee court costs and legal fees whenever such plaintiff owns no real property in Brazil that may ensure such payment. This bond must be sufficient to assure payment of court fees and defendant’s attorneys’ fees, as determined by the Brazilian judge. The bond is not required for foreclosure proceedings based on an extrajudicial title, for the enforcement of court decisions, for the filling of counterclaims and in case an international treaty so releases.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

Brazilian bankruptcy law provides for a stay period of up to 180 days, that may be exceptionally extended for the same period once, provided that the debtor has not contributed to the delay. During the stay period, the creditors cannot bring or continue any legal or foreclosure proceedings against the debtor, except for those creditors which relate to tax claims, employment claims, claim that have a fiduciary claim to the underlying asset, lessors, owners or committed sellers of real estate where the relevant agreement includes an irrevocability or irreversibility clause; and claims that have retention of title clauses or are beneficiaries of forward exchange agreements (however, these creditors cannot sell or remove assets which are deemed as essential by judicial ruling for the debtor’s activities during the stay period). After such period, without approval of a reorganization plan, creditors are entitled to submit an alternative proposal to the plan filed by the debtor. This alternative proposal must be voted by a creditors committee in accordance to the terms and quorums established by the Brazilian bankruptcy legislation. Shareholders and directors also keep the control and management of the company, but may be removed if certain requirements are met. A court appointed administrator (administrador judicial) will supervise the administrators’ acts in order to guarantee that they will comply with the legal requirements. The commencement of judicial and out-of-court reorganization does not have the effect of terminating the company’s contracts. Nevertheless, the reorganization plan is able to terminate and/or amend the conditions of those contracts. For judicial reorganization proceedings, the debtor must present a list of creditors, classified according to the legal standards, including (i) labor credits; (ii) secured credits; (iii) unsecured credits; and (iv) credits held by micro and small enterprises (a class provided in Complementary Law No. 147, dated August 7, 2014) as each of those classes of creditors vote separately in the approval of a reorganization plan. Creditors that were not listed by the debtor are entitled to claim for inclusion (credit qualification). Creditors that disagree with the amount or classification in the list are entitled to claim for correction (correction request). On judicial recovery, all credits should be paid as established in the approved reorganization plan. For the approval of the reorganization plan at a creditors’ general meeting, two requirements must be met: (i) in the classes of secured and unsecured creditors, the plan must be approved by more than 50% of the creditors attending the meeting both by amount of claims and number of creditors (on a headcount basis); and (ii) in the classes of labor claims and small enterprises, by more than 50% of creditors attending the meeting (on a headcount basis), regardless of the amount of their claims. The Brazilian bankruptcy law also grants the debtor the possibility to cram down the reorganization plan, in the event that the requirements described above are not met. The cram down is only possible if (i) at least 50% of the creditors attending the meeting voted favorably for the approval of the reorganization plan; (ii) the plan is approved by three classes of creditors; or, in the event that there are only three classes of creditors, at least two classes of creditors approved the plan; or, in the event that there are only two classes of creditors, at least ----- one class approved the plan; (iii) one-third of the creditors attending the meeting in the rejecting class voted favorably for the approval of the plan (such one third can be either based on the amount of claims and/or number of creditors, depending on the class), and (iv) the reorganization plan does not provide for an unfair treatment of the class of creditors which has rejected the plan. The reorganization plan results in the replacement and renewal of all credits existing prior to the filing of the reorganization, which will be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved reorganization plan, and is binding on the debtor and all creditors subject to it, although it does not affect guarantees provided by third parties which are not part of the reorganization proceeding. Once the reorganization plan has been approved, the debtor will remain under the judicial reorganization proceeding for a maximum period of two years, during which debtor’s failure to comply with any obligations set forth in the plan will result in the conversion of the judicial reorganization into a bankruptcy liquidation proceeding. However, in many cases, courts allow the debtor to seek approval of an amendment to the plan at a creditors’ meeting, in order remedy any breaches to the provisions of the plan which may have occurred. In similar fashion, failure to obtain approval of the reorganization plan from creditors or failure to secure court confirmation of the reorganization plan will also result in the commencement of liquidation proceedings against such debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,196

When a company is bankrupt, the debts become due and payable, with a pro-rata deduction of interest, all foreign currency claims are converted into Brazilian Real, the debtor is automatically prevented from exercising any business activity and from managing or disposing of its assets, the court appoints a judicial administrator to manage the bankruptcy, the judicial administrator collects the debtor’s property and assets, and values them, shareholders cannot sell their estate shareholdings or otherwise withdraw from the company, if the value of the debtor’s assets is insufficient to pay creditors no interest accrues on claims (except interest on debentures and secured claims, which can be paid with the proceeds of sale of the underlying security) and agreements which the debtor entered into with third parties do not terminate automatically. The judicial administrator may perform these agreements if certain requirements are met. For bankruptcy proceedings, there is a statutory order of preferences/privileges to be observed by the judge on the payment of the credits. Brazilian law establishes the following order: (i) claims relating to employee contracts, limited to 150 times the monthly minimum wage per employee, and on-the-job accidents; (ii) claims of creditors that hold in rem security (up to the value of the assets given as security); (iii) federal, state and municipal tax claims, excluding fines and credits excluded from the scope of the bankruptcy procedure; (iv) all other unsecured claims; (v) contractual and public fines and penalties, including tax penalties; (vi) subordinated claims, including claims by the debtor’s shareholders and managers which do not have an employment relationship with the debtor (when the hiring has not been made under arm's length conditions and market practices); and (vii) interest accrued after the bankruptcy procedure has commenced. Additionally, some claims are not subject to the bankruptcy proceeding and shall be paid before the claims listed in this paragraph, including:(i) expenses whose early payment is essential for the bankruptcy management; (ii) strictly wage-related labor claims overdue within three months prior to the bankruptcy decree, limited to five minimum wages per employee; (iii) amounts derived from debtor-in-possession loans; (iv) fees payable to the judicial administrator, his assistants and the creditors’ committee (if applicable) and labor-related claims or occupational accident claims referring to services rendered after the decree of bankruptcy; (v) obligations resulting from valid legal acts performed during the judicial reorganization or after the bankruptcy decree; (vi) credit provided by the creditors to the bankrupt estate; (vii) administrative expenses connected to management, asset realization and distribution of the proceeds, as well as court costs of the bankruptcy proceeding; (viii) court costs with respect to actions and enforcement proceedings ----- in which the bankrupt estate is defeated; and (ix) taxes which become due after the decree of bankruptcy.Nevertheless, prior to the payment of the creditors mentioned in the paragraph above, the following post-commencement claims and creditors shall be paid: (i) fees payable to the judicial administrator and his assistants and labor-related claims or occupational accident claims referring to services rendered after the decree of bankruptcy; (ii) credit provided by the creditors to the bankrupt estate; (iii) administrative expenses with schedules, management, asset realization and distribution of the proceeds, as well as court costs of the bankruptcy proceedings; (iv) court costs with respect to actions and enforcement proceedings in which the bankrupt estate is defeated; (v) obligations resulting from valid legal acts performed during the judicial reorganization, such as _debtor-in-possession_ loans, or after the decree of bankruptcy, and taxes which become due after the decree of bankruptcy. In addition, claims secured by fiduciary assignments, as well as claims deriving from lease agreements or from advances in foreign exchange agreements, among others, are entitled to restitution, and will not be affected by the bankruptcy. After the sale of the assets and the distribution of the proceeds amongst the creditors, and after the judicial administrator submits a final report, the court will terminate the bankruptcy proceeding. The debtor will be discharged from its obligations in the following cases: (i) payment of all claims in full; (ii) payment of more than 25% of the unsecured claims, after all assets are sold; (iii) the lapse of 3 years following the decree of bankruptcy, except for the assets collected before that time; or (iv) termination of the bankruptcy proceeding by the relevant judicial court. In principle, debtor’s subsidiaries and affiliates are treated as separate entities and are not affected by the filing of a judicial reorganization, an extrajudicial reorganization or a bankruptcy. As of December 2020, Brazilian law on bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings expressly incorporated provisions allowing entities from the same economic group to file request for joint judicial reorganization proceedings. The debtors that meet certain requirements provided for in the Brazilian bankruptcy law (and that are part of a group under common corporate control) may request judicial reorganization proceeding under procedural consolidation. With regard to substantial consolidation, the relevant judge may authorize it, exceptionally, when there is interconnection and confusion between the assets or liabilities of the debtors of the group of companies, in a way that it is not possible to identify their ownership. In such case, there must be the occurrence of at least two of the following hypotheses: (i) existence of cross guarantees; (ii) control or dependency relationship; (iii) total or partial identity of the corporate structure; and (iv) joint operation in the market among the applicants.
