**MiFID II Product Governance / Eligible counterparties and professional clients only target market:**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the debt securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum has led
to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt securities is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii)
all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however,
a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in
respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to Retail Investors in the European Economic Area (“EEA”): The debt securities**
described in the attached Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered or sold to, and
should not be offered or sold to, any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended or superseded,
the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended,
the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling any in-scope instrument or otherwise making such
instruments available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling such debt
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation. The attached Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any
offer of the debt securities described therein in the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
securities. The attached Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to Retail Investors in the UK:** The debt securities described in the attached
Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or made available to and should not be
offered, sold or made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
in the UK by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus
**Regulation”).**

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling
the debt securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum or otherwise making such debt
securities available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared. Offering or selling such debt
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under
the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The attached Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of the debt securities described therein in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the


-----

EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
securities. The attached Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION. DATED MARCH 23, 2023**

**Preliminary Offering Memorandum** **Not for General Distribution**


**in the United States of America**

##### IHO Verwaltungs GmbH

**_€500,000,000_** **_% /_** **_% Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured PIK Toggle Notes due 2028_**


IHO Verwaltungs GmbH, a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) organized under the laws of the Federal
Republic of Germany (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its      % /      %
Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured PIK Toggle Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in
arrears on           and           of each year, commencing          , 2023. The first two and the final interest payments on the
Notes will be made in cash. For each other interest payment the Issuer will be required to pay interest on the Notes entirely in cash (“Cash
**Interest”), unless the conditions described in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”) are satisfied, in which**
case the Issuer will be entitled to pay, to the extent described herein, interest for such interest period by increasing the principal amount of
the Notes or by issuing Notes (“Additional PIK Notes”) in a principal amount equal to such interest (in each case, “PIK Interest”). Cash
Interest on the Notes will initially accrue at the rate of      % per annum (the “Cash Interest Rate”). The Cash Interest Rate will increase by
0.25% per annum with respect to any interest payment period commencing on          , 2026 and thereafter, unless the Issuer has
notified the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent(s)) (each as defined herein) in writing on or prior to the Certification Date (as
defined herein) that the Schaeffler Group (as defined herein) has achieved the Sustainability Performance Target (as defined herein) for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, as described in more detail in this Offering Memorandum. PIK Interest will accrue at the then
applicable Cash Interest Rate plus 0.75% per annum. If the Issuer pays all eligible interest in PIK Interest, it will increase the principal
amount of the Notes or issue Additional PIK Notes in relation to the Notes, in a principal amount of up to a maximum of €      million
(assuming Step-up Interest (as defined herein) is not payable) or €      million (assuming Step-up Interest is payable). Upon the payment
of PIK Interest, a notice shall be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “LuxSE”) in the form of Appendix 1.

The Notes will mature on          , 2028. The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after          , 2025
at the redemption prices specified herein. Prior to          , 2025, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of
the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a “make-whole” premium. In addition,
prior to          , 2025, the Issuer may redeem at its option up to 40% of the Notes, using the proceeds of certain equity offerings. Upon
redemption of the Notes in connection with certain optional redemptions, the redemption prices will be adjusted as described herein
unless the Issuer has notified the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent(s)) in writing at least five days prior to giving the
relevant redemption notice that a certain Sustainability Performance Level (as defined herein) has been achieved. See “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes
at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation,
the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes.

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu with all other indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated
to the Notes, including indebtedness outstanding under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the Existing Issuer Notes (each as
defined herein). Upon issuance, the Notes (together with the Issuer’s obligations under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the
Existing Issuer Notes and certain hedging liabilities) will initially be secured by pledges over (i) 333,000,001 common shares in Schaeffler AG
(representing 66.6% of the voting shares (Stammaktien) and 50.0% plus one share of the total share capital of Schaeffler AG) held by the
Issuer, (ii) 48,742,194 common shares in Continental AG held by the Issuer (representing 24.4% of the total share capital of Continental
AG), and (iii) 9,748,439 common shares in Vitesco Technologies Group AG (“Vitesco AG”) held by the Issuer (representing 24.4% of the total
share capital of Vitesco AG), in each case as described in this Offering Memorandum (the “Collateral”). As of the Issue Date, the Notes will
not be guaranteed by any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of any of
the Issuer’s subsidiaries (in particular, Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries). The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing and
future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such indebtedness.

The restrictive covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes (the “Indenture”) will only apply to the Issuer and not to Schaeffler AG
and its subsidiaries or any future subsidiaries that are designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture). See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to the Notes and our Structure—Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the_
_Indenture and will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, will not guarantee the Notes and will not provide any_
_Collateral.”_

**All or part of the Collateral may be released or impaired without the consent of the holders under certain circumstances and is subject**
**to certain limitations.**

only as of the date on the cover page hereof, and our business or financial condition and other
information in this Offering Memorandum may change after that date. Information in this Offering
Memorandum is not legal, tax or business advice; accordingly, you should consult your own legal, tax
and business advisors regarding an investment in the Notes.

You should base your decision to invest in the Notes solely on information contained in this Offering
Memorandum. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized anyone to provide you with any
different information.

We are offering the Notes in reliance on an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act
for an offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. If you purchase the Notes,
you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and warranties as
detailed under this section. You may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the
Notes for an indefinite period. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are making an offer to sell the
Notes in any jurisdiction where the offer and sale of the Notes is prohibited or make any
representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you. No action has been, or will be,
taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose.

Each prospective purchaser of the Notes must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the Notes and must obtain any
consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it of the Notes under
the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such
purchases, offers or sales, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers shall have any responsibility
therefor.

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any U.S. state securities commission nor any
non-U.S. securities authority nor other authority has approved or disapproved of the Notes or
determined if this Offering Memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is
a criminal offense.

We have applied to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the LuxSE and traded on the Euro MTF
Market, which is not a regulated market within the meaning of MiFID II. We cannot guarantee that our
application to the LuxSE for approval of this Offering Memorandum, or for the Notes to be admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market, will be approved as of the settlement date for the Notes or at any
time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not conditional on obtaining this listing.

We accept responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. We have made
all reasonable inquiries and confirm to the best of our knowledge, information and belief that the
information contained in this Offering Memorandum with regard to us and our subsidiaries and
affiliates and the Notes is true and accurate in all material respects, that the opinions and intentions
expressed in this Offering Memorandum are honestly held and that we are not aware of any other facts
the omission of which would make this Offering Memorandum or any statement contained herein
misleading in any material respect.

affiliates, and neither the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates make any
representation or warranty or accept any responsibility or any liability, as to the accuracy or

Memorandum or any other information provided by the Issuer in connection with the issuance of the
Notes.

None of the Issuer, Schaeffler AG, the Initial Purchasers, the ESG Coordinator, the Trustee, the
Security Trustee, the Registrar, the Agents, their respective affiliates nor any of their respective

the sustainability or other environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) characteristics of the Notes.
The Notes may not satisfy an investor’s requirements or any current or future legal or industry
standards for investment in assets with sustainability or other ESG-related characteristics. Investors
should conduct their own assessment of the Notes from a sustainability or other ESG perspective.

By receiving this Offering Memorandum, investors acknowledge that they have had an opportunity
to request for review, and have received, all additional information they deem necessary to verify the
accuracy and completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Investors
also acknowledge that they have not relied on the Initial Purchasers in connection with their
investigation of the accuracy of this information or their decision to invest in the Notes. The content
of this Offering Memorandum is not to be considered legal, business, financial, investment, tax or
other advice. Prospective investors should consult their own counsel, accountant and other advisors
as to legal, business, financial, investment, tax and other aspects of a purchase of the Notes. In
making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of our business, the
terms of the offering of the Notes and the merits and risks involved.

We have prepared this Offering Memorandum solely for use in connection with the offer of the
Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons (within
the meaning of Regulation S) outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. You agree
that you will hold the information contained in this Offering Memorandum and the transactions
contemplated hereby in confidence. You may not distribute this Offering Memorandum to any

We and the Initial Purchasers may reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part, sell less
than the entire principal amount of the Notes offered in the Offering or allocate to any purchaser less
than all of the Notes for which it has subscribed.

Certain exchange rate information presented in this Offering Memorandum is extracted from
information and data publicly released by official and other sources. While we accept responsibility
for accurately summarizing the information concerning exchange rates, and as far as we are aware
and able to ascertain no facts have been omitted which would render this information inaccurate or
misleading, we accept no further responsibility in respect of such information. The information set
out in relation to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing clearing and settlement
arrangements, including the section entitled “Book-entry, Delivery and Form,” is subject to change in
or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream currently in
effect. While we accept responsibility for accurately summarizing the information concerning
Euroclear and Clearstream, and, as far as we are aware, and able to ascertain, no facts have been
omitted which would render this information inaccurate or misleading, we accept no further
responsibility in respect of such information.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes

acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Memorandum under “Transfer Restrictions.”
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities
laws of any state of the United States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer. Prospective
purchasers are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the
provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a description of certain
further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes may not

being referred to as “T+9”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering
Memorandum or the next six successive business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement code at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes
who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. See “Plan of Distribution.”

### Notice to Certain European Economic Area and UK Investors

 Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market -MIFID II

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that (i) the target market for the Notes
is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”), and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

### Prohibition of Sales to Retail Investors in the EEA

The Notes are not intended to be offered or sold to, and should not be offered or sold to, any retail
investor in a Member State of the European Economic Area. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended or superseded,

(the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling any in-scope instrument or otherwise making such
instruments available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the
Notes in the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is permitted only by Relevant
Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or made available to and should not be offered, sold

not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

### Forward-looking Statements

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements and other information that involves
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The words “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions are used to identify
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts;
they include statements about our beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them.
These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to our
management. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and
we undertake no obligation to update any of them in light of new information or future events.

By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These statements
are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forwardlooking statements. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements
as a result of various factors including, but not limited to:

  - the performance of the global economy, international conflicts, political uncertainty and the
performance of the economy in the regions in which we operate;

  - our exposure to increases in market prices of raw materials and energy;

  - market trends and technological developments, including trends toward electric mobility;

  - the imposition of tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers on automobiles and other goods;

  - cyclicality in our industry;

  - competition in our business environment;

  - our dependence on a limited number of customers for the sale of a substantial portion of our
products, the significant bargaining power of our major customers, and risks from any decline
in the creditworthiness of our customers;

  - the increase in the product lives of the parts we produce;

  - challenges associated with climate change and increasing environmental regulation;

  - risks arising from our efforts to do business and to expand in a number of growth markets;

  - risks relating to our ability to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions;

  - our dependence on a limited number of key suppliers for certain critical components used in
our production and manufacturing processes;

  - the disruptions to the global economy and financial markets as a result of COVID-19;

  - our ability to maintain the high quality of our products and the punctual delivery of ordered
goods, and our ability to fight lower quality counterfeit products illegally sold under our brand
names;

  - our ability to obtain the adequate funding for our research, development and growth activities
and adequate insurance coverage for our operations;

  - our ability to retain qualified executives and key employees and to maintain positive
relationships with our employees and employee representatives;

  - our dependence on complex information technology systems and networks to support
business processes and communications;


-----

  - risks related to unforeseen business interruptions and our ability to obtain sufficient insurance
coverage;

  - changes in interest rates and changes in exchange rates;

  - our ability to implement our efficiency and portfolio optimization and growth programs
successfully as well as our ability to achieve our targets and expectations;

  - various legal, regulatory and tax risks; and

  - other risks related to our financing, to our business operations and the markets in which we
operate.

Should one or more of such risks and uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions
prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated in the applicable forwardlooking statements. Any forward-looking statement or information contained in this Offering
Memorandum speaks only as of the date the statement was made.

All of the forward-looking statements made by us herein and elsewhere are qualified in their entirety
by the risk factors discussed in “Risk Factors” and “Industry.” These risk factors and statements
describe circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
any forward-looking statement in this Offering Memorandum.

None of Schaeffler AG, the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers assume any obligation to update any of the
forward-looking statements after the date of this Offering Memorandum to conform those
statements to actual results, subject to compliance with all applicable laws. None of Schaeffler AG,
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers assume any obligation to update any information contained in this
Offering Memorandum or to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements to
reflect events or circumstances, or to reflect that the Issuer became aware of any such events or
circumstances that occur after the date of this Offering Memorandum.

### Presentation of Financial and Other Information

 Presentation of Financial Information

The historical financial information of the Schaeffler Group presented in this Offering Memorandum
as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 has
been taken or derived from the English-language translation of the audited German-language
consolidated financial statements of Schaeffler AG as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021 (including comparative financial information as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively) (the “Audited Consolidated Financial
**Statements 2022” and the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021,” respectively;**
together, the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and from Schaeffler Group’s internal
accounting system.

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to section 315e(1) of the German Commercial
Code (Handelsgesetzbuch; “HGB”).

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, along with the English-language translations of the
respective German-language independent auditor’s reports of KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“KPMG”) with respect thereto are included in this Offering
Memorandum beginning on page F-1.

Effective as of January 1, 2022, we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes
to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2022). As a result, starting in 2022, we began


-----

reporting earnings before financial result and income taxes (EBIT) to include income (loss) from
equity-accounted investees. Figures for 2021 have been adjusted retrospectively (except in the
discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Results of Operations—Comparison of 2020 with 2021,” or as_
otherwise noted herein, to facilitate comparability between periods) to reflect this change. EBIT and
related figures for 2020 have not been adjusted retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully
comparable to the figures for subsequent periods.

Additionally, until December 31, 2021, our Automotive Technologies Division comprised four
business divisions (“BDs”) with a distinctive product and service portfolio: (i) E-Mobility, (ii) Engine
Systems, (iii) Transmission Systems and (iv) Chassis Systems. As from January 1, 2022, we have
reorganized our Automotive Technologies Division’s BDs to include: (i) E-Mobility, (ii) Engine Systems
& Transmission Systems, (iii) Bearings, and (iv) Chassis Systems. See “Business—Our Divisions—
_Automotive Technologies Division.” Discussions and figures in this Offering Memorandum refer to the_
previous BDs with regard to financial figures for 2020 and refer to the new BDs with regard to
financial figures for 2021 and 2022, except under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Results of Operations—_
_Comparison of 2020 with 2021,” where the discussions and figures refer to the previous BDs for_
comparability reasons.

Effective as of January 1, 2021 we changed our accounting policy for development services. The new
accounting treatment, which was applied retrospectively, reflects the relationship between
development services and future volume production in a different manner. Under the new model,
development costs of all customer projects are capitalized as costs to fulfill a contract starting when a
volume contract with the customer becomes highly probable, and then amortized appropriately over
the period of volume production. Revenue is similarly accrued as a contract liability and realized over
the period of volume production as well. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2021, we changed the
presentation of expenses for production technology and for use of real estate. Figures for the year
ended December 31, 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021 have
been adjusted retrospectively to reflect these accounting changes. The change presents the link
between development services and volume production in the financial information more accurately.
Previously, revenue was recognized for development services that represented a distinct, separately
identifiable performance obligation vis-à-vis the customer and for which we were entitled to
consideration under the contract. This revenue was recognized when the development services had
been rendered in full. The related expenses were expensed as cost of sales when revenue was
recognized. See note 1.4 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021. Financial figures for
the year ended December 31, 2020 presented in this Offering Memorandum are taken or derived
from the comparative figures for 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
2021.

Schaeffler Group reports financial information based on the following three Divisions: Automotive
Technologies, Automotive Aftermarket and Industrial.

The allocation of customers to segments is reviewed at least annually and adjusted where necessary.
In each of 2020, 2021 and 2022, such review resulted in the re-allocation of customers between
Divisions. To ensure that segment information is comparable between subsequent periods,
comparative information for the respective prior period included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a period has been adjusted using the customer allocation structure from such period.

Except as otherwise indicated, financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020
has been taken or derived from the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021 and financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been taken or derived from the
comparative financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the


-----

Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2022. Accordingly, the financial information as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2020 included herein may differ from the corresponding figures in the
published audited consolidated financial statements of Schaeffler AG as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020, and the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021
included herein may differ from the corresponding figures in the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements 2021.

The historical financial information of the Issuer presented in this Offering Memorandum as of and
for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 has been taken
or derived from the English-language translation of the audited German-language unconsolidated
financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December
31, 2022 (including comparative financial information as of and for the years ended December 31,
2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively) (the “Issuer Audited Unconsolidated Financial
**Statements”). The Issuer Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the**
basis of German generally accepted accounting principles (“German GAAP”) in accordance with the
HGB and have been audited by KPMG. Pursuant to the HGB, the Issuer is not required to prepare
notes to the Issuer Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Issuer is not required to
prepare consolidated financial statements or any interim financial statements. KPMG has issued
unqualified auditor’s reports in accordance with the applicable provisions of the HGB, in particular
section 322 HGB, with respect to the Issuer Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements.

IFRS and German GAAP differ in certain material respects from generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). As a result, the results of operations and financial
condition derived from the financial statements that are included in this Offering Memorandum may
differ substantially from the results of operations and financial condition derived from financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. None of Schaeffler AG or the Issuer has prepared
a reconciliation of its financial information to U.S. GAAP or a summary of significant accounting
differences in the accounting and valuation methods between IFRS or German GAAP on the one
hand, and U.S. GAAP on the other hand, nor has any of them otherwise reviewed the impact the
application of U.S. GAAP would have on its financial reporting. Accordingly, in making an investment
decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the financial information of Schaeffler AG
and the Issuer.

In this Offering Memorandum, references to “2022,” “2021” and “2020” refer to the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Individual figures (including percentages)
appearing in this Offering Memorandum have been rounded according to standard business practice.
Figures rounded in this manner may not necessarily add up to the totals contained in a given table.
However, actual values, and not the figures rounded according to standard business practice, were
used in calculating the percentages indicated in the text. Therefore, in certain cases, the percentage
figures appearing in the text may differ from the percentages that would be obtained based on
values which have been rounded.

All of the financial data presented in this Offering Memorandum is shown in millions of euro (in
€ million), except as otherwise stated. A dash (“–”) signifies that the relevant figure is not available,
while a zero (“0”) signifies that the relevant figure is available but either the figure was zero or was
rounded to zero. Where financial data is labeled “audited,” this means that such data has been taken
from the audited financial statements mentioned above. The label “unaudited” is to indicate financial
data that has not been taken from the audited financial statements mentioned above but has been
taken or derived from the internal reporting system of the Schaeffler Group or the Issuer, as the case
may be, or is based on calculations of figures of the abovementioned sources.


-----

### Pro Forma Financial Information

In addition to the financial information described above, this Offering Memorandum includes
unaudited pro forma financial information for the Issuer and for the Schaeffler Group as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022, which has been adjusted to reflect certain effects of (i) in the
case of the Issuer, the Refinancing (as defined under “Summary—The Refinancing”) and (ii) in the
case of the Schaeffler Group, certain effects of the Ewellix Acquisition (as defined under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the
_Schaeffler Group—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions”) and related financing_
on the Schaeffler Group’s indebtedness and cash position, in each case, as if such transactions had
occurred on (i) January 1, 2022, for purposes of the calculation of income statement and cash flow
items or (ii) December 31, 2022, for purposes of the calculation of balance sheet items. The
unaudited pro forma financial information included herein has not been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any
generally accepted accounting standards. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon
available information and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Neither the
assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma financial
information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards.

The unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only and should not be
considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Refinancing been
completed on the dates indicated and do not indicate our future consolidated results of operations
or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited
_pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in_
assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma financial information.

The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in “Certain Financial Information of the Issuer,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group” and the financial statements_
contained in this Offering Memorandum, including the related notes thereto, beginning on page F-1.

### Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This Offering Memorandum contains non-GAAP measures and ratios, including adjusted EBIT,
EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, net interest paid, capital expenditures, cash in- and outflows for M&A
activities, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion, free cash flow before cash in- and outflows for
M&A activities, working capital, net financial debt and certain leverage, coverage and Loan-to-Value
(“LTV”) ratios, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, any generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), including IFRS or German GAAP. We present non-GAAP measures
because they are used by management in monitoring our business and because we believe that they
and similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties in evaluating companies in our industry. The definitions of the non-GAAP measures as used by
the Schaeffler Group and the Issuer are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The nonGAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and
have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of our operating results as reported under the relevant GAAP. Non-GAAP measures and
ratios such as adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, net interest paid, capital expenditures, free
cash flow, free cash flow conversion, working capital, net financial debt and leverage, coverage and
LTV ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under any GAAP and should not be
considered as alternatives to profit for the year or any other performance measures derived in
accordance with IFRS or German GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or
financing activities. Each of the EBITDA-based measures presented in this Offering Memorandum is


-----

defined and calculated differently from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the
Indenture.

### Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework

In connection with the Offering, the Issuer adopted a framework relating to the Issuer’s sustainability

## Summary

_The following summary is intended as an introduction to this Offering Memorandum and summarizes_
_selected information from it. Because of the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum, including the financial information section, investors are strongly_
_recommended to carefully read the Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”_
_“Description of the Notes” and the risks described under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking_
_Statements,” and base their decision on whether to invest in the Notes on a review of the entire_
_Offering Memorandum._

_The Issuer is a holding and finance company and does not conduct any business operations of its own._
_The main assets of the Issuer are 500,000,000 common shares in Schaeffler AG (representing 100% of_
_the voting shares and 75.1% of the total share capital of Schaeffler AG), 71,990,458 common shares in_
_Continental AG (representing 36.0% of the total share capital of Continental AG) and 15,984,093_
_common shares in Vitesco AG (representing 39.9% of the total share capital of Vitesco AG). The_
_operating business as described throughout this Offering Memorandum relates to the Schaeffler_
_Group._

### The Issuer

The Issuer is a holding and finance company underpinned by three main assets: a 75.1% stake
(representing 100% of the voting rights) in Schaeffler AG, a 36.0% stake in Continental AG and, since
its spin-off from Continental AG in September 2021, a stake in Vitesco AG that the Issuer increased to
39.9% in 2022. Schaeffler AG, Continental AG, and Vitesco AG are global manufacturing companies
headquartered in Germany and listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. As of March 16, 2023,
Schaeffler AG had a market capitalization (including voting and non-voting shares) of €4,417 million
(based on the volume weighted average price per non-voting share of Schaeffler AG quoted on the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange during the last 60 trading days), Continental AG had a market capitalization
of €13,487 million (based on the volume weighted average price per share of Continental AG quoted
on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange during the last 60 trading days) and Vitesco AG had a market
capitalization of €2,517 million (based on the volume weighted average price per share of Vitesco AG
quoted on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange during the last 60 trading days). We believe that the Issuer’s
“three pillar” model represents strategic value, benefiting from exposure to its three complementary
underlying assets and from the Schaeffler Family’s history of value creation.

Dividends received from Schaeffler AG and Continental AG have historically provided the Issuer with
strong recurring cash flows. The Issuer received aggregate dividends of €436 million in 2020 (€220
million from Schaeffler AG and €216 million from Continental AG). In 2021, the Issuer received
dividends of €120 million from Schaeffler AG, while Continental AG did not pay any dividends in that
year as a result of its negative net income in 2020, which was in part due to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. In 2022, the Issuer received aggregate dividends of €362 million (€245 million from
Schaeffler AG and €117 million from Continental AG (net of a withholding tax of €42 million, which is
expected to be credited against the corporate income tax liability for 2022, and to the extent
exceeding corporate income tax liability, it is expected to be reimbursed in 2023)), while Vitesco AG
carried its retained earnings for the year 2021 forward and paid no dividends for 2021.

In the invitation to its annual general meeting of shareholders for 2023, the boards of Schaeffler AG
proposed dividends of €0.44 per common voting share (which would amount to aggregate dividends
of €220 million with respect to the common voting shares held by the Issuer). In its preliminary
results release for 2022, Continental AG stated its management board had resolved to propose
dividends of €1.50 per common share (which would amount to aggregate dividends of €80 million


-----

(net of an expected withholding tax of €28 million, which is expected to be credited against the
corporate income tax liability for 2023, and to the extent exceeding corporate income tax liability, it
is expected to be reimbursed in 2024) with respect to the common shares held by the Issuer) to its
annual general meeting. Vitesco AG indicated that it will carry forward its retained earnings for the
year 2022 and pay no dividends for 2022 during its capital markets day presentation on October 11,
2022. If the Schaeffler AG and Continental AG dividends are approved as proposed, this would result
in aggregate dividends expected to be received by the Issuer in 2023 of €300 million. The annual
general meetings of shareholders of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG are scheduled to
be held on April 20, April 27 and May 17, 2023, respectively. There can be no assurance that the
annual general meetings of shareholders will resolve on the dividends as proposed or that there will
not be further reductions in dividends the Issuer receives in the future or that any dividends will be
paid at all.

### Schaeffler Group Overview

We develop and manufacture high-precision components, systems and services for powertrains and
chassis, as well as rolling and plain bearing solutions for various industry applications. This includes
innovative and sustainable technologies for hybrid, electric and combustion-engine powered
vehicles. Our offering comprises solutions for automated and autonomous driving, components and
systems for rotary and linear motion, as well as services, maintenance products and monitoring
systems for a wide range of industrial applications. Our portfolio also includes OEM-quality repair
solutions and associated supporting services for the global automotive aftermarket.

We are one of the largest family-controlled technology companies in the world, with approximately
82,800 employees and a network of production and manufacturing locations, R&D facilities and
distribution companies in approximately 200 locations in over 50 countries (as of December 31,
2022). Our 76 plants form the foundation of our operations.

In 2022, we had consolidated revenues of €15.8 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of €2.0 billion in 2022.
For an explanation of the components of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income to
Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Financial Information—Summary Financial Information of Schaeffler
_AG (IFRS)—Other Financial and Operating Data.” We have a large and growing presence in a number_
of growth markets, such as China and the rest of Asia. We believe that we benefit from our advanced
technology platform, high product quality, long-standing and diversified customer relationships,
broad distribution channels, global production footprint and extensive product, systems solutions
and service offering.

We operate through three divisions: Automotive Technologies, Automotive Aftermarket and
Industrial.

  - **_Automotive Technologies Division: Our Automotive Technologies Division partners with the_**
global automotive industry in developing and manufacturing components and system solutions
for electric and hybrid powertrains and fuel cell powertrains, as well as for internal combustion
engines and chassis systems. The Division also offers a wide range of rolling bearings that is
largely powertrain-agnostic. Our Automotive Technologies Division accounted for 60.1% of our
consolidated revenue and 27.9% of our Adjusted EBIT in 2022. We supply approximately
17,000 products to all major automotive OEMs as well as approximately 1,100 automotive
suppliers globally through our Automotive Technologies Division. As a partner of the
automotive sector, we are at the forefront of developing and manufacturing a broad range of
automotive applications. Our operating excellence relates to components and system solutions
for vehicles with powertrains based on the internal combustion engine, as well as for hybrid
and electric vehicles. Our main products include electric drives, clutch systems, transmission
components, torsion dampers, valve train systems and camshaft phasing units and electric
drives. Our precision products are key to helping make engines more fuel-efficient and


-----

compliant with increasingly strict emission requirements. At the same time, they also increase
driving comfort and vehicle dynamics and extend maintenance intervals and service life. As an
advanced global automotive supplier, we offer extensive technical expertise for the entire
powertrain.

  - **_Automotive Aftermarket Division: Our Automotive Aftermarket Division complements the_**
Automotive Technologies Division with an extensive aftermarket offering. It accounted for
12.9% of our consolidated revenue and 24.4% of our Adjusted EBIT in 2022. Our Automotive
Aftermarket Division provides an extensive aftermarket offering, which includes the
distribution of spare parts and services to approximately 2,100 customers globally. Customers
mainly include almost all major international and national trading companies. In addition to
the traditional component business consisting of replacement parts, our Automotive
Aftermarket Division develops and distributes repair sets and custom assembled kits for
passenger cars, light and heavy duty commercial vehicles and tractors, to help make vehicle
repairs simple, efficient and professional. The Automotive Aftermarket Division uses two
primary distribution channels to sell its products and services to customers, the original
equipment service (“OES”), which supplies original spare parts to automobile OEMs for their
branded repair shops, and the open (independent) spare parts market or independent
aftermarket (“IAM”), which supplies components and repair solutions and services to a global
network of independent parts distributors, which supply workshops that are not affiliated with
any particular automobile OEM. A considerable portion of IAM’s sales market comprises of
distributors organized in trade cooperatives. The Automotive Aftermarket Division is largely
supplied from the Automotive Technologies Division’s production and manufacturing
locations.

  - **_Industrial Division: The Industrial Division develops and manufactures components and_**
systems for rotary and linear movements as well as services such as maintenance products and
monitoring systems. It accounted for 27.0% of our consolidated revenue and 47.7% of our
Adjusted EBIT in 2022. We supply approximately 59,200 products to customers in a variety of
different industrial sectors which we group into eight sector clusters within four market
clusters: renewables (wind), transportation and mobility (aerospace, rail, offroad and twowheelers), machinery and materials (raw materials and power transmission) and industrial
automation (industrial automation). The Industrial Division is also developing new products
and solutions for the hydrogen economy. The product portfolio of the Industrial Division
includes a wide range of rolling and plain bearings, linear and direct drive technologies as well
as services such as maintenance products and monitoring systems. The market focus is
increasingly on smart products and connected components that increase machine and plant
efficiency. We believe that customers require intelligent solutions and optimized lifecycle
costs, which opens up new growth areas for the Industrial Division. Our strategic business field
“Lifetime Solutions”, is aimed at developing these areas, which we consider to be significant
growth opportunities for our business. Lifetime Solutions combines the entire industry-specific
business with mechatronic systems and digital services as well as the required related
components. We complement our business with an extensive aftermarket offering, which
includes the distribution of spare parts and services to customers worldwide.

We have a strong global presence. Our business activities are divided into four regions: Europe
(Germany, Western Europe, Middle East & Africa, Central & Eastern Europe), the Americas (the U.S.
& Canada, South America, Mexico), Greater China (including Mainland China, also Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao) and Asia/Pacific (South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia and India). In addition to the
traditional core markets in Europe (41.5% of our consolidated revenue in 2022) and the Americas
(22.3% of our consolidated revenue in 2022), our business in the Greater China and Asia/Pacific
regions, which accounted for 22.8% and 13.4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue in 2022,
has contributed significantly to our overall growth in recent years. In particular, despite the


-----

significant decline in 2020 revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues in the Greater
China Region increased by 6.8% in 2020. Following our integrated “as regional as possible” approach,
we have built a global manufacturing footprint with each of our plants having a strong regional
foothold. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 44 plants in Europe, 13 in the Americas, ten in
Greater China and nine in Asia/Pacific. Nearly all of our plants are certified under globally recognized
quality norms, standards, and regulations. In addition, as part of the Ewellix Acquisition in January
2023, we acquired six additional manufacturing and customization sites in Europe, the U.S. and Asia
(please note that the Ewellix Group sites are not consolidated with the Schaeffler Group plants for
purposes of the discussions of the latter in this Offering Memorandum).

### Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the following competitive strengths have been the primary drivers of our success in
the past and will continue to set us apart from our competitors in the future:

**_German Precision Engineering and Manufacturing Company with Strong Global Positions across_**
**_Portfolio Based on Quality and Technology_**

We have a long tradition of precision engineering and manufacturing expertise, particularly in the
area of high-precision mechanical components and systems. This expertise has enabled us to gain
leading positions across our core customer sectors: two-wheelers, passenger cars & light commercial
vehicles, truck & bus, offroad, rail, aerospace, raw materials, industrial automation, power
transmission, and wind. Based on our research, we believe we are among the leading companies in
the engine, transmission, chassis systems and E-mobility sectors, and in particular in engine valve
train components, dual mass flywheels, ball screw drives for electrical power steering and electric
drive solutions. Being a partner to manufacturers of passenger cars and commercial vehicles, the
Automotive Technologies Division is actively involved in shaping technological change in the industry
via its R&D activities and expects that in 2035, approximately 60% of all passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles will have all-electric drive systems and approximately 30% will have a hybrid
powertrain (a combination of an electric motor and an internal combustion unit), and also by 2035,
approximately 10% of passengers cars and light commercial vehicles manufactured will be driven in a
highly automated manner and approximately 15% in a partly automated manner. The R&D activities
of the Automotive Technologies Division are aimed at developing and expanding its expertise with
respect to mechatronic applications and systems for efficient, low-emission, and electrified
powertrains, as well as autonomous driving and strengthening the profitability and efficiency of its
extensive existing expertise in the field of mechatronics and mechanical systems. We believe our
Automotive Aftermarket Division is very well positioned within the market, particularly in the Europe
and Americas regions, offering all-in-one solutions with components in original equipment quality for
a safe and proper vehicle repair. In our Industrial Division, high-quality components and an
understanding of how they interact within a system are fundamental to success in the systems
business and our “Lifetime Solutions” products offer comprehensive services in the age of
digitalization. For that reason, the Division is strengthening its existing extensive expertise in the
fields of mechatronics and mechanical systems and is also enhancing it with respect to mechatronic
systems and digitalization solutions. We support OEMs throughout their full product lifecycle, from
taking part in the early stages of product development to providing critical engineering application
know-how, and are therefore regarded as a key partner.

Quality and reliability are the key attributes of our products and services, as many of our products
are mission-critical to the performance, durability and safety of the equipment in which they are
installed. As our products are critical to the overall performance, safety and durability of the endproduct and generally represent only a small percentage of the overall costs of the end-product, the
primary criteria for purchasing decisions by our customers are quality and technological excellence
rather than price alone. Providing superior product quality to our customers is therefore key to our


-----

business model and paramount to our success. A holistic quality management system in all of our
locations, including all manufacturing plants worldwide, has been designed to ensure compliance
with our high quality standards, which are monitored by means of regular internal audits. With
various quality assurance programs, and our comprehensive quality culture, as well as testing and
simulation processes, mostly developed in-house, we emphasize our goal of achieving zero-defect
quality for the entire supply chain worldwide, and we believe that we achieve failure rates that are
significantly lower than the industry average.

Our commitment to the highest industry quality standards and technological prowess are underlined
by the numerous awards and certifications our products and services have received, including
multiple awards from major automobile OEMs such as Volkswagen, Volvo, Ford, Nissan, Toyota and
General Motors and over 50 quality awards since 2020. In 2022, we received the Red Dot Best of the
Best Award in the category “Design Concept,” the Magna Supplier Award, we were a finalist for the
European Association of Automotive Supplier’s (CLEPA) Innovation Award in the category “Clean and
Sustainable Mobility” and were nominated for the 2022 German Innovation Award. In 2021, we
received Red Dot Design Awards in the two categories “Smart Product” and “Industrial Design,” a
Railsponsible Supplier Award in the category “Climate Change and Circular Economy,” the
Automotive News PACE E-Mobility award and its Innovation Partnership award, a Best Practice
Award from Rolls-Royce, the Golden Steering Wheel Award from the car magazine “AUTO BILD”
together with our collaboration partner Ford Motor Co. and the “Smart Technology Innovation of the
Year” award at the 2021 ASEAN Wind Future Awards.

**_Well Positioned for Structural Change in our Key Markets Based on our Strong Technology_**
**_Competence and Investments in Innovation_**

We consider our technology competence and our strong system integration capabilities to be among
our key competitive advantages. Our product innovations have formed the backbone of our success
for many decades, and we continuously invest in our products, services and processes to protect our
market positions. Our worldwide R&D capabilities include approximately 7,400 R&D staff at 20 R&D
centers and additional R&D locations in a total of 25 countries that are developing new products,
customer product applications, technologies, processes and methods for market-driven solutions. On
average over 2020, 2021 and 2022, we spent 5% of our consolidated revenue on R&D to continuously
improve our products and to position us at the forefront of our industry in terms of innovation and
quality of design. Our strong innovative ability is illustrated by the number of our patent applications
in recent years. With 1,266 patent registrations in 2022, we ranked fourth among Germany’s most
innovative companies according to the German Patent and Trademark Office (Deutsches Patent- und
_Markenamt, DPMA). In total, as of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 22,900 patents and_
patent applications.

We believe that our focus on innovation, quality, system understanding, and high-precision
manufacturing positions us well to address the key trends that we expect to influence our business in
the future: sustainability & climate change, new mobility & powertrain electrification, autonomous
production, the data economy and digitalization and demographic change. In particular, European
legislation limiting CO2 emissions cause OEMs to focus on the optimization of efficiency, friction
reduction and valve train variability for conventional powertrains.

In the automotive sector, systems for electric axels and hybrid drive systems, autonomous driving,
connectivity and new mobility solutions as well as efficient internal combustion engines, automated
transmissions, are expected to be the main drivers of future growth. In 2022, we inaugurated our
new center of competence in software and electronics development in Pune, India and we began the
expansion of our E-mobility development and manufacturing campus in Buehl, Germany, to add a
new center of excellence for E-mobility. In 2021, we opened our new E-mobility plant in
Szombathely, Hungary. The plant is our first production plant worldwide dedicated to E-mobility and
it is a center for excellence for components and systems for electrified powertrains. Our Chassis


-----

System BD also entered into a partnership with Mobileye B.V., a subsidiary of the Intel Group, which
will enable us to offer an autonomous, flexible, and adaptable vehicle platform based on Mobileye’s
technology.

In the industrial sectors, we believe that in particular the increasing demand in wind and other
renewable forms of energy as well as in the power transmission and industrial automation customer
segments, will drive future growth. In the course of 2021, we introduced our comprehensive and
automated condition monitoring solution “OPTIME,” which makes condition monitoring efficient,
easy to use and cost-effective across all indirectly process-critical assets for entire machine and
equipment parks. Since its introduction, OPTIME has been implemented in more than 170 customer
plants and 37 of our own plants. See “Industry—Industrial—Historical and Forecast Market
_Development” and “—Our Divisions—Industrial Division—Strategic Business Areas” and “Industry—_
_Industrial—Historical and Forecast Development.”_

We believe that in many of these areas we are a frontrunner, and we have recently made selective
acquisitions and entered into joint ventures to further strengthen our production and product
spectrum and to expand our technological expertise. For example, in 2021, we expanded the services
offering of our Industrial Division when we acquired Bega, a manufacturer of special tools for
mounting and dismounting roller bearings. In 2022, we acquired Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives
GmbH, formerly Melior Motion GmbH (“Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives”) and a manufacturer of
innovative precision gearboxes for industrial robots, we acquired the remaining interest in Schaeffler
ByWire, which develops and sells the steer-by-wire steering technology “Space Drive,” a key
technology for autonomous driving. We also entered into our joint venture Innoplate, with Symbio
SAS, itself a joint venture of Faurecia and Michelin hydrogen company, to produce fuel cell bipolar
plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global mobility and energy solutions. In addition, we
acquired CERASPIN, a manufacturer of high-quality ceramic components for roller bearings used in a
wide range of strategic growth areas, including wind energy, rail, aerospace, medical equipment,
electrical engineering and the semiconductor industry. In January 2023, we acquired the Ewellix
Group, a manufacturer of innovative linear motion and actuation solutions used in assembly
automation, medical applications and mobile machinery.

Consistently increasing technological requirements lead to growing demand for our technologicallyadvanced products, as they are more and more integrated into the respective end-applications. This
has enabled us, in many cases, to increase the percentage of the value of our end customer’s product
that is composed of products we supply. Globally, we have been able to increase our content per
vehicle (i.e., the Schaeffler Group’s annual automotive revenues, excluding aftermarket revenues,
truck revenues and other revenues (e.g., tooling, R&D charges), divided by the respective number of
light vehicles produced per year) with a CAGR of approximately 4.4% from 2013 to 2022, despite the
COVID-19 pandemic. Given our technological expertise and our focus on and investment in
innovation, we believe that we are well placed to benefit from the structural megatrends in the
markets that we serve and to transform our portfolio over time from a components supplier to a
complete systems supplier helping to shape progress that moves the world across the areas driving
growth of CO2-efficient drives, chassis applications, industrial machinery & equipment, renewable
energy and aftermarket solutions & services.

**_Resilience based on Diversified and Robust Business Portfolio, Structural Improvements and Cost_**
**_Flexibility_**

Our revenues are diversified across a wide range of bearings and automotive components and
systems and industrial products, generated by thousands of applications for customers across many
diverse end-markets. Within our Automotive Technologies and Automotive Aftermarket Divisions, we
sell approximately 61,100 products and system solutions to OEMs and the aftermarket sector. Within
our Industrial Division, which accounted for 27.0% of our consolidated revenue and 47.7% of our
Adjusted EBIT in 2022, we serve customers in a variety of different sectors, selling approximately


-----

59,200 products and system solutions for a diverse range of applications ranging from wind turbines
to aerospace engines and tool machines. Our end markets are influenced by different economic
factors, making us less vulnerable to adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment or
fluctuations of a particular economic parameter affecting individual regions or market segments. For
example, our Industrial Division recorded a 19.7% increase in revenue in 2022 as compared to 2021
(prior year: 13.9%), despite the impacts of the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, rising inflation and
the semiconductor shortage, which negatively affected vehicle production and therefore demand for
products of our other Divisions. In addition, the wind sector cluster of our Industrial Division
recorded significant revenue increases in the first half of 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic which
resulted in revenue declines in other parts of our business. We also believe that being an integrated
automotive and industrial supplier provides us with significant synergies potential. There are many
overlaps between the different business areas of our Divisions, such as the use of the same materials
and components, the application of the identical production technologies, and the joint purchasing of
raw materials, and we intend to focus even more closely on realizing cross-divisional economies of
scale as well as economies of scope going forward.

Our customer base is also diversified. Our products are sold to OEMs, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers,
aftermarket distributors and service providers in a variety of different sectors. Tier 1 suppliers
produce technologies and solutions geared towards finished products and work directly with OEMs.
Tier 2 suppliers produce specialized parts and components and sell these products to Tier 1 suppliers,
and Tier 3 suppliers provide raw materials and other products. Our key customers include top-tier
OEMs in the global automotive sector as well as leading industrial OEMs. As of December 31, 2022,
we sold our products to all major automotive manufacturers as well as approximately 1,100
automotive suppliers and approximately 5,800 industrial customers in approximately 130 countries
worldwide. In 2022, the Automotive Technologies Division’s top ten customers represented 64.8% of
its revenues, the Automotive Aftermarket’s top ten customers represented 29.5% of its revenues and
the Industrial Division’s top ten customers represented 18.5% of its revenues. We believe this
diversification mitigates counterparty risk and is broader than that of most of our peers.

Our products are often part of platforms that are in service for several years, thereby requiring
continuous aftermarket support and providing a robust revenue stream. In 2022, revenue of our
Automotive Aftermarket Division accounted for 12.9% of our consolidated revenue and 24.4% of our
Adjusted EBIT. In addition, we also generate significant revenue from our industrial aftermarket
business.

Our diversified and high-quality product offering, our focus on our strong positions in our regions and
product segments, our technology and innovation leadership and our proximity to and entrenchment
with our diversified customer base have brought robustness to our sales, with our Automotive
Technologies and Automotive Aftermarket Divisions’ sales volumes having developed better than
underlying automotive production since 2015, with higher growth rates during cyclical upturns and
greater robustness during periods of challenging market conditions including during the COVID-19
pandemic and the geopolitical and economic challenges of 2022. Our ability to pass on a significant
portion of the price increases for nearly all of the input materials key to our operations helped to
mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, rising inflation, the semiconductor
shortage and other challenges in 2022 and protect our margins, particularly in our Industrial and
Automotive Aftermarket Divisions.

Our high degree of diversification, combined with the effects of various structural measures focused
on sustainable efficiency and profitability improvements that we implemented as part of our ongoing
efficiency and portfolio optimization divisional subprograms, and specific cost-efficiency measures
we implemented in early 2020 in response to the declining demand as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, helped to mitigate its impact on our business and return us to profitability quickly. In
2020, following a challenging first three quarters, we recorded positive EBIT and net income of €270
million and €100 million in the fourth quarter, and we reported positive Adjusted EBIT and cash flows


-----

from operating activities in each quarter, except the second one. In 2021, at €1,266 million, our
Adjusted EBIT returned to pre-COVID-19 levels (Adjusted EBIT for 2019 was €1,161 million) and our
Adjusted EBIT margin of 9.1% in 2021 surpassed that of 8.1% in 2019. (Effective as of January 1, 2022,
we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022). EBIT and related figures in this paragraph have not been adjusted
retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully comparable to the figures for subsequent periods.
See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the
_Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Comparability—Accounting Policy Changes.”)_

**_Strong Production Competence and Broad Global Manufacturing Footprint_**

We consider the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and processes to be one of our strengths.
We focus on lean manufacturing and continuous improvement and are seen as a reliable partner
with a high level of value added for our customers. In recent years, our expertise in special machinery
construction for digitized, automated and modular production facilities, originally developed as part
of the Technology and Innovation sub-program, has progressed from the development of innovative
production technologies for our own production to become an independent business unit with
external business in 2022.

In addition, we believe that our outstanding know-how in materials, such as steel, our know-how in
surface technology and cold forming technology, our low-cost precision manufacturing processes and
our attention to quality and service are competitive advantages that allow us to consistently provide
high-quality precision products and services. We design and manufacture a number of our tools inhouse and this provides us with unique know-how regarding high-precision manufacturing processes.
Furthermore, we perform most quality-related work in-house, which is designed to ensure that our
products maintain a consistently high standard of quality, as demonstrated by the numerous quality
awards we have won from our customers. We operate 20 R&D centers which focus on creating
proprietary products and systems and provide unique manufacturing know-how to our production
and manufacturing locations.

Our production competence and superior product quality are reinforced by our global manufacturing
footprint, which forms the foundation of our operations and as of December 31, 2022 included 76
plants in 22 countries worldwide, which are characterized by a high level of vertical integration. In
addition, as part of the Ewellix Acquisition in January 2023, we acquired six additional manufacturing
and customization sites in Europe, the U.S. and Asia (please note that the Ewellix Group sites and
employees are not consolidated with the Schaeffler Group plants and employees for purposes of the
discussions of the latter in this Offering Memorandum). Moreover, we have built a geographically
diversified global footprint while ensuring that each of our plants and facilities has a strong regional
foothold, is in close geographic proximity to our customers, and benefits from cost-efficient just-intime logistics. As a result, we are perceived as a local supplier in many markets, and our global
manufacturing and sales platforms allow us to market our products and services to a larger and everglobalizing customer base. Our global footprint, with close proximity to our customers and many of
our suppliers, also reduces complexity of our supply and delivery logistics and helps mitigate the risk
of disruptions in our deliveries to customers and supply chain. Our position as one of the largest
global mechanical components and systems manufacturers further allows us to capitalize on the
growth opportunities associated with globalization and increasing international trade flows, while
making us less susceptible to market risks in any single country or region.

As a result of our global presence, we believe we are very well positioned in our key growth markets,
in particular in the Greater China region, where we have been present for decades.

**_Strong Management Combining Deep Industrial Expertise_**

Our management team has extensive experience in the automotive and industrial sectors and a
proven track record of successfully managing global businesses through economic cycles, including
the economic downturn in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and the global financial crisis,
and of implementing efficiency and cost reduction measures, such as in our Industrial Division, which
helped improve the Adjusted EBIT margin of the Industrial Division from 7.3% in 2016 to 11.7% in
2022. The successful CORE realignment program improved the efficiency and competitive position of
our Industrial Division by realigning its structure towards stronger customer orientation and
streamlining its leadership structure and the efficiency and portfolio optimization divisional
subprograms and the cost savings measures our management implemented in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic helped us through the difficulties of the COVID-19 pandemic and return us to
profitability quickly. Our management team has also demonstrated its ability to achieve long-term
profitable growth and establish the Schaeffler Group as one of the technology, quality and innovation
leaders in the industry.

Our well-established investor relations and treasury functions have significant capital markets
experience and a superior financing track record that includes many successful bond issuances since
2012 and Schaeffler AG’s IPO and listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2015.

### Strategy 

Our vision is to be the automotive and industrial supplier of choice that leads through innovation,
agility and efficiency. To pursue this vision, and building on our specific capabilities and competitive
advantages of innovation, quality, system understanding and manufacturing excellence, we have
established the Roadmap 2025, which sets our strategic direction and defines an integrated program
of measures within and across our three Divisions.

**_Our Strategic Focus Areas_**

Based on five future trends that we expect to have strong impacts on our business and that we
consider strategic opportunities for our future success – sustainability and climate change, new
mobility and electrified powertrain, autonomous production, data economy and digitalization, and
demographic change – we have determined five areas that we intend to focus our strategic efforts
on:

  - _CO2-Efficient Drives: In the context of increasing environmental awareness and the associated_

efforts to decarbonize, supported by various laws and regulations, CO2-efficient drives play an
important role in our automotive business. Based on our profound system understanding up to
the whole-of-vehicle level, we can supply components and systems for all types of powertrains
in order to develop and implement CO2-efficient powertrain solutions together with our
customers. In addition to our current product portfolio, which ranges from solutions for
combustion engines and hybrid solutions to fully electric drive systems, we want to
systematically develop our fuel cell expertise from components and stacks through to systems.
As an important step in this direction, we entered into the joint venture Innoplate, with
Symbio SAS, itself a joint venture of Faurecia and Michelin hydrogen company, to produce fuel
cell bipolar plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global mobility and energy solutions.
Innoplate is expected to begin large-series production of bipolar plates in 2024, with an initial
production capacity of 4 million bipolar plates per year and the goal to increase production to
around 50 million bipolar plates per year by 2030. We also believe that hydrogen technology
will become important for applications in our industrial business. In addition, we have
developed a 4-in-1 electric powertrain business, which expands on our 2-in-1 and 3-in-1
electric powertrain offerings to add thermal management to the combined transmission,
electric motor and power electronics. We have also entered into a new market segment for


-----

the electrification of heavy duty vehicles, for which we can utilize the same production
machinery that we have developed for light vehicles.

  - _Chassis Applications: Developments in chassis applications are driven by the trend towards_

new forms of mobility and the progressive automation of driving functions towards
autonomous driving. We are intensifying our activities at the component and system level,
especially with regard to reliability and safety. This includes the consistent further
development of vehicle components as well as the development of innovative steer-by-wire
solutions for volume production. In addition to innovative chassis applications for the
automotive business, we also focus on autonomous vehicles in the logistics or transport sector.

  - _Industrial Machinery and Equipment: With a view to increasing autonomous production, we_

want to offer our customers innovative mechatronic systems for the growing robotics market,
building on and expanding our existing product offering, such as our high-performance and
precise robotic arm actuators, which feature compact electric motor technology based on a
printed circuit board (PCB), coated sensors and low friction bearings with high wear resistance.
As an important step in this direction, we recently acquired the Ewellix Group, a manufacturer
of innovative linear motion and actuation solutions used in assembly automation, medical
applications and mobile machinery and Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives, a manufacturer of
innovative precision gearboxes for industrial robots. In addition to robotics, we intend to
continue our focus on conventional components for rotary or linear applications.

  - _Renewable Energy:_ Against the background of major climate challenges, the global demand for

renewable energy is growing. As a partner to the energy industry, we want to continue to
support the expansion of regenerative energy generation, building further on our
comprehensive portfolio of products that make energy generation from renewable resources
more economical, such as bearings for wind power turbines (with two-thirds of all wind
turbines globally including Schaeffler products, based on our internal estimates) to solutions
for the solar and hydroelectric sectors. This focus area is also an essential part of our
sustainability strategy.

  - _Aftermarket Solutions & Services:_ Given the advances being made in autonomous production,

new mobility concepts, vehicle connectivity and the trend towards an increasing data economy
and digitalization, services are becoming an increasingly important part of our offering. In the
industrial space, our customers benefit from our growing portfolio of cost-efficient monitoring
and service solutions (IoT) for broad range of plant and machinery assets, while the increasing
technical complexity and connectivity of vehicles is driving demand for innovative repair
solutions in the automotive sector and the development of new business models and support
services. With the addition of data-based services and innovative plug & play repair solutions
to our portfolio, we are continuing our transition from a components supplier to a provider of
systems and integrated solutions. In addition, we want to offer our customers holistic
solutions, including access to in-vehicle data, through various industrial partnerships within the
automotive aftermarket ecosystem.

**_Implementing Our Strategy_**

As an integral part of our Roadmap 2025 we have developed an execution program, entitled Strategy
2025, to coordinate the implementation of our strategy. Reflecting our organizational and leadership
structure, the Strategy 2025 comprises subprograms for each of our three Divisions as well as four
cross-divisional subprograms.

_Divisional Strategy Programs_

Our Automotive Technologies Division, is focusing its growth efforts on accelerating the portfolio
shift to E-mobility and a successful transition to new and CO2-efficient powertrain and chassis


-----

technologies, in close collaboration with our customers. For this purpose, we plan to invest in the
development of innovative components and systems for new engine technologies, fuel cells, hybrid
and electric drive systems and chassis technologies. As part of this strategy, we commissioned our
first production plant worldwide dedicated to E-mobility in 2021, to manufacture components and
systems, such as electric motors and hybrid drives and it is center for excellence for components and
systems for electrified powertrain. In 2022, we began the expansion of our E-mobility development
and manufacturing campus in Buehl, Germany, to add a new building complex that will serve as a
new center of excellence for E-mobility.

Our Automotive Aftermarket Division is focused on maintaining its high profitability by extending its
digital and service offering, introducing new repair solutions and opening up new ways to the market,
including by establishing new digital sales channels. We also seek to address industry trends, such as
increasing consolidation of distribution partners, changes in the competitive environment, growing
complexity in vehicle technology and a shift from individual components towards customer-oriented
repair solutions and services, by improving our competitiveness, extending our skill base and applying
new business models. In line with this strategy, in 2022, the Automotive Aftermarket Division
launched the first electric axel repair solution “E-Axle RepSystem-G.” The system is scalable and the
Division is developing additional repair solutions based on the system, for example, for electric
motors.

Our Industrial Division is focused on strengthening its leading position in bearings solutions and to
develop and entering new and profitable growth fields, including through the increased use of new
digital and mechatronic technologies. In order to meet our strategic priority of innovation, we strive
to win a key position in the condition monitoring sector and robotics, and we aim to harness
opportunities for our business along the hydrogen production and use chain. The Industrial Division
also aims to make sustainable profitability contributions across the Division and achieve higher
operative value generation over the whole value chain. As part of this strategy, in 2022, we acquired
CERASPIN, a manufacturer of high-quality ceramic components for roller bearings used in a wide
range of strategic growth areas, including wind energy, rail, aerospace, medical equipment, electrical
engineering and the semiconductor industry. In January 2023, we acquired the Ewellix Group, a
manufacturer of innovative linear motion and actuation solutions used in assembly automation,
medical applications and mobile machinery. In addition, in 2022, we entered into a twelve year
partnership with Rolls-Royce through which Rolls-Royce is securing their rolling bearing supply chain
through 2035 and we are making an important step in our growth initiative by supporting Rolls-Royce
with innovative products, R&D excellence and manufacturing capacity.

_Cross-Divisional Strategy Programs_

In addition to the strategic measures we are implementing on a divisional basis, we are also focusing
on four subprograms on a group-wide basis, across our Divisions:

  - _Innovation & Technology: We are strategically managing our product and technology_

innovations in order to strengthen further our position as a pioneer of sustainable mobility and
motion, and we focus our innovation activities on harnessing synergies across our Divisions.
We have defined specific innovation clusters, including hydrogen and energy transition, and
material and surface science, with a view to maintaining our technological competitive
advantage and successfully meeting customer needs through continuous innovation in the
relevant areas. See “—Our Functions—Research and Development.” We also seek to bring in
external perspectives by promoting an open collaboration with a global network of external
partners, such as the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the Nanyang Technological
University (“NTU”), including the opening of a laboratory at NTU in May 2022 to undertake
research in the pioneering areas of robotics and digitalization, and our becoming an anchor
partner to STARTUP AUTOBAHN, an innovation platform which brings together more than 30
partners and 30,000 start-ups with the objective of developing new technologies to


-----

marketability. In 2022, we also began a research program with Johnson Matthey, Bekaert and
TNO to accelerate proton exchange membrane (“PEM”) electrolyzer technology development,
by optimizing the most important components of the electrolyzer stack and a collaboration
with the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, operated by the German Aerospace Center
(DLR), to accelerate the development of application-oriented solutions in robotics. We are also
focused on using our significant skills in scaling up to industrial production to get promising
innovations to market quickly and in large unit numbers.

  - _Digitalization & IT: We focus on reshaping our processes for the digital age through data-_

driven knowledge acquisition and state-of-the-art IT solutions and on closer internal and
external collaborations between our employees, customers, and business partners. As data is
becoming an ever more important part of our economic ecosystem, we seek to promote the
end-to-end digitalization and automation of our processes and implementation of a robust,
cross-divisional, fully synchronized, and future-proofed IT landscape. We are also aiming to
provide future-ready process, data, and IT solutions for our human resources, finance and R&D
functions and our operations, including by enhancing and optimizing our shared service center,
to promote increased efficiency and flexibility. To this end, digitalization experts from all
business and IT departments work together on evaluating the latest digital technologies and
market trends in terms of opportunities and risks, identifying profitable digital solutions for
Schaeffler and carrying them forward in a sustainable and value-focused manner.

  - _People & Culture: We are emphasizing our focus on a high-performance culture through the_

implementation of newly designed remuneration systems that are rigorously focused on
quantitative targets and are encouraging an appreciative and performance-oriented leadership
style and support for employees through measures aimed at modern personnel development
and collaboration as well as even greater diversity within our workforce.

  - _Sustainability & Engagement: We are embedding environmental and social responsibility in_

our value chain as a central success factor for sustainable business operations and are
determined to support our customers in meeting their sustainability obligations. We have also
developed and incorporated a dedicated climate action plan to support the implementation of
measures required to achieve climate neutrality.

**_Our Approach to Capital and Portfolio Management_**

Through our investment and capital allocation framework we seek to drive consistent capital
deployment and shift R&D spending to new technologies and future growth areas. In this context, we
categorized our businesses as either “mature” or “new” and then further divided those into four
portfolio strategies based on growth potential and return on capital employed: “build” and “grow”
for our new businesses and “harvest” and “exit/divest” for our mature businesses. For our “build”
and “grow” businesses, we plan with a reinvestment rate, defined as the ratio of capital expenditures
to depreciation and amortization, of significantly above 1.0, to fuel growth. Those businesses
categorized as “harvest” and “exit/divest” only receive the required capital to sustain cash
generation. In this way, we actively manage our portfolio with the goal of ensuring profitability in
mature businesses and strong growth in new businesses.

Particularly in the Automotive Technologies Division we will increasingly distinguish between mature
business and new business in the future, as the transformation towards innovative powertrain and
chassis technologies progresses. In our mature businesses, we are “harvesting” profitable enablertechnologies for the powertrain agnostic automotive bearings market, and optimized combustion
engines and “exiting/divesting” expiring businesses, reducing complexity, and consolidating our
footprint in Europe with a focus on Germany. Among our “mature” businesses, we have divested our
stake in Bio-Hybrid GmbH, which developed a four-wheel pedelec bike, known as the “Bio-Hybrid”
and sold our global chain drive business. In our new businesses, particularly to further enhance our E

-----

Mobility BD products and services and our Chassis Systems BD products and services, we are
“growing” in electrified powertrains, fuel cells and chassis mechatronics and “building” competencies
in electrified powertrains and hydrogen. We have developed a 4-in-1 electric powertrain business,
which expands on our 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 electric powertrain offerings to add thermal management to
the combined transmission, electric motor and power electronics. We have also entered into a new
market segment for the electrification of heavy duty vehicles, for which we can utilize the same
production machinery that we have developed for light vehicles.

We believe that hydrogen fuel cells offer a potential alternative to pure electric battery solutions,
which have disadvantages for the heavy duty vehicle segment, in particular for long-haul use, and will
become more relevant in 2025-2030. We have therefore launched a broad initiative on hydrogen to
explore the use of hydrogen fuel cells for various potential applications across all our Divisions,
efforts which we categorize as “build.” We plan to capitalize on our existing expertise, for example, in
manufacturing bipolar plates, to develop complete hydrogen fuel cell systems. In 2022, we entered
into our joint venture Innoplate, with Symbio SAS, itself a joint venture of Faurecia and Michelin
hydrogen company, to produce fuel cell bipolar plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global
mobility and energy solutions. Innoplate is expected to begin large-series production of bipolar plates
in 2024, with an initial production capacity of 4 million bipolar plates per year and the goal to
increase production to around 50 million bipolar plates per year by 2030. We also began a shared
research program with Johnson Matthey, Bekaert and TNO, in 2022, to accelerate proton exchange
membrane (“PEM”) electrolyzer technology development, by optimizing the most important
components of the electrolyzer stack. We also signed a letter of intent in 2022 with Lhyfe, a French
green hydrogen producer, for Lhyfe to construct and operate an industrial electrolysis plant on our
site in Herzogenaurach, Germany, with a capacity of up to 15 MW. We expect the plant to start
operations in 2025 and to supply our Herzogenaurach plant and other regional customers with
approximately 3.7 tons of green hydrogen daily. The agreement with Lhyfe also sets out a technology
partnership to promote the use of our electrolysis stacks.

**_Our Focus on Profitable Growth_**

We pursue a strategy of mainly organic growth, based on our existing technological expertise and
innovation capabilities. With respect to external growth, we intend to focus on small bolt-on
acquisitions that either expand our technological expertise or strengthen our market position
(particularly in the areas of automotive aftermarket, chassis mechatronics, power electronics &
electronics manufacturing, hydrogen, Lifetime Solutions, mechatronics and systems and rotative and
linear components). In the evaluation and execution of acquisitions we intend to follow a disciplined
approach with clear guidelines, including, among others, that acquired businesses must be earnings
accretive within one year of their integration and their return on capital employed must be greater
than their working average cost of capital within two years.

On the basis of our investment and capital allocation framework we have defined 12 growth
initiatives to express the focus of our growth efforts:

In our Automotive Technologies Division, these focus on E-drives for electric powertrains; customercentric electric axles for hybrid and electric powertrains, which are an important element of growth
in the E-mobility area; dedicated hybrid transmissions for hybrid powertrains, encompassing
innovative and efficient dedicated hybrid transmissions and hybrid modules; future engine
**_technologies for all powertrains, particularly in the context of electrified powertrains; and chassis_**
**_mechatronic solutions for assisted and automated mobility._**

In our Automotive Aftermarket Division, the growth initiatives focus on aftermarket wheel bearings
for passenger cars to be the one-stop shop for our customers; plug and play repair solutions for
**_garages to address the increased complexity of repairs and meet the demand for high-quality and_**


-----

convenient repairs; and a transparent and user-friendly B2B platform developed by us that connects
manufacturers, dealers, and resellers of automotive parts in China (the “ETC Platform China”).

In our Industrial Division, the growth initiatives focus on large-size bearings for the wind industry to
offer our customers bearing solutions that meet the most rigorous requirements in terms of quality,
reliability, and durability; robotics for industrial automation to help shape the increasing automation
of industrial production with products such as our systems solutions for robotics; for both industrial
robots and “cobots” (collaborative robots), we intend to offer a broad product range, from
innovative bearing solutions to high-precision robotic arm joints and high-performance linear
actuators, thereby extending the application of robot technologies in work environments; and service
**_solutions for industrial applications, including a wide range of innovative condition monitoring and_**
lubrication solutions to increase plant availability and improve safety in the production environment.

As cross-divisional growth initiative across our Automotive Technologies and Industrial Divisions, we
intend to focus on hydrogen for automotive and industrial applications with areas of application
ranging from energy generation and storage to zero-emission drive solutions. We believe that our
core competences in material, forming, and surface coating technology will enable us to develop
efficient volume production for key components for the future hydrogen economy, along the entire
energy chain.

Geographically, we intend to continue to expand our presence in growth markets, for example in the
Greater China and the Asia/Pacific regions which have been growth drivers for all of our Divisions.
We expect the largest increase in both vehicle population and demand for repairs to occur outside of
Europe through 2025. To expand our presence in the Greater China and Asia/Pacific regions, we have
been opening or expanding local plants, such as the opening of a new production hall in Nanjing,
China and a large size bearing refurbishment center in India in 2021, a new manufacturing plant and
a new center for software and electronics development in in India in 2022, and we plan to expand
our campus in Taicang, China. In 2020, we started our ETC Platform China and, in 2021, we entered
into an agreement with Shanghai REFIRE Group Limited to cooperate on the development and
manufacture of key components for hydrogen fuel cells in 2021.

**_Our Focus on Sustainability_**

Sustainability is an anchor of our Roadmap 2025 strategy and means being economically successful
while at the same time assuming responsibility for the environment and society.

While sustainability represents a significant component of our corporate values and is considered a
task of society as a whole, it is also an opportunity for business growth. A key example is the rapid
acceleration of electrification and a significant increase in battery and fuel cell powered vehicles. As a
global technology company, we are actively shaping the far-reaching transformation of mobility and
energy solutions. Together with our customers, we take a holistic approach to developing innovative
product solutions for the demands of the future, including climate-friendly energy generation and
alternative drives, intelligent repair solutions and new mobility concepts, and energy-efficient,
material and process optimized bearing technologies.

We strive to become a leader of innovation in E-mobility by offering our customers innovations and
development expertise in E-mobility on both a system and component level and products covering
many areas of electrification, from mild hybridization to all-electric driving. Our electric axle drives,
which entered into volume production in 2021, have set a new benchmark for the output density of
electric transmissions. We also began volume production of electric motors for hybrid modules,
hybrid transmissions, and all-electric axle drives in 2021. We also believe that hydrogen will play a
decisive role in fundamentally changing the entire energy and mobility sector and will become more
relevant from 2025 and are therefore focusing on it as a growth initiative across our Automotive
Technologies and Industrial Divisions. In 2022, we entered into our joint venture Innoplate, with
Symbio SAS, to produce fuel cell bipolar plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global mobility


-----

and energy solutions. Innoplate is expected to begin large-series production of bipolar plates in 2024,
with an initial production capacity of 4 million bipolar plates per year and the goal to increase
production to around 50 million bipolar plates per year by 2030.

We understand sustainability as a cross-functional task. With our Sustainability Strategy, we address
ten action fields such as climate neutrality, circularity and occupational health and safety. In 2022,
overall responsibility for sustainability within the Schaeffler Group was transferred to our Chief
Executive Officer. We also adopted a more decentralized and topic-specific decision-making
approach for sustainability issues and established a dedicated sustainability network across all
Divisions, functions and regions. We have also adopted group wide sustainability goals. With respect
to the environment, these goals address, among others, the increase in energy efficiency, the
purchase of renewable energies and climate-neutral production across all regions by 2030. And since
our commitment to sustainability is not confined to just the Schaeffler Group but extends to our
suppliers, we have also included the purchasing of production materials from suppliers with
sustainability self-assessments as one of our goals as well as climate-neutral production across all
regions, including the entire supply chain, by 2040. In 2022, the global non-profit Carbon Disclosure
Project (CDP), which is a leading environmental disclosure database and sets the standard for
corporate environmental disclosure transparency, awarded us the highest rating of “A” in the
categories of climate change and water security, recognizing our leadership in disclosure and
performance in those categories. For more information on our sustainability goal, see “—
_Environment, Social and Governance.”_

Our sustainability goals not only express our ambitions, but are also key tools for performance
measurement and management. Since 2020, the achievement of sustainability goals has been
integrated into the variable compensation of our top management team.

### Recent Developments

### The Refinancing 

The Issuer intends to use the gross proceeds from the Offering, together with cash at banks, (i) to
redeem (the “Issuer Notes Redemption”) €500 million in principal amount of the Existing 2025 Euro
Notes (the “Redeemed Issuer Notes”), including the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
up until the applicable redemption date and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the Offering and
the Issuer Notes Redemption. The Issuer expects to redeem the Redeemed Issuer Notes on or about
May 15, 2023. See “Use of Proceeds.”

For purposes of this Offering Memorandum, the “Refinancing” refers to the issuance of the Notes
offered in the Offering and the application of proceeds therefrom as described above.

### Sustainability-Linked Bond Features 

The Issuer has a long-term vision to play a key role in sustainability transition supporting social and
economic development along the value chain and is committed to use its influence as a major
shareholder in the entities in which it holds majority or significant minority stakes to promote
sustainability and environmental responsibility. The Issuer has developed the Sustainability-Linked
Financing Framework (the “Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework” or the “Framework”) to
provide a robust methodology for sustainability-linked financing instruments for the Issuer, and
define certain sustainability performance goals with respect to the Schaeffler Group to share the
Issuer’s and Schaeffler AG’s joint commitment to reducing environmental impact with their
stakeholders, as well as taking the necessary steps to maintain a competitive advantage in the
markets where the Schaeffler Group operates. The Framework has been developed in alignment with
the International Capital Market Association’s (“ICMA”) Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles 2020
(“SLBP”), as well as the Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles 2023 (“SLLP”) administered by the Loan
Market Association (“LMA”). The Framework does not form part of this Offering Memorandum. The
Framework is in addition to, and separate from, a green finance framework previously adopted by
Schaeffler AG. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Issuer’s
Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework published on the website of Schaeffler AG (the website
does not form a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this Offering Memorandum), which
provides additional details on the points mentioned below.

The Framework identifies two key performance indicators, which are measured and reported on an
annual basis (each, a “Key Performance Indicator” or “KPI”): (i) absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions (“GHG Emissions”) of the Schaeffler Group (“Scope 1+2 **KPI”) and**
(ii) Scope 3 upstream GHG Emissions of the Schaeffler Group’s supply chain (“Scope 3 KPI”). Only the
Scope 1+2 KPI will be applicable to the Sustainability Performance Target related to the Notes. The
Framework also defines three sustainability performance goals for the KPIs: (i) in respect of the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2025, a reduction by at least 75% of absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG
Emissions to 260,800 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (“CO2e”) or below (the “Sustainability
**Performance Target”), (ii) in respect of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2030, a reduction by at**
least 90% of absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG Emissions to 104,300 metric tons of CO2e or below
(the “Scope 1+2 2030 Performance Goal” and together with the Sustainability Performance Target,
the “Scope 1+2 Performance Goals”), in each case compared to the baseline for the Schaeffler Group
of 1,043,000 metric tons of CO2e as of December 31, 2019 (the “Baseline Scope 1+2 GHG
**Emissions”), and (iii) in respect of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2030, a reduction by at least**
25% of Scope 3 upstream GHG Emissions to 4,603,500 metric tons of CO2e or below (the “Scope 3
**2030 Performance Goal” and, together with the Scope 1+2 Performance Goals, the “Sustainability**
**Performance Goals”) compared to the baseline for the Schaeffler Group’s supply chain of 6,138,000**
metric tons of CO2e as of December 31, 2019 (the “Baseline Scope 3 GHG Emissions” and together
with the Baseline Scope 1+2 GHG Emissions, the “Baseline GHG Emissions”). Only the Sustainability


-----

Performance Target will be applicable to the Notes. The Baseline GHG Emissions were calculated by
Schaeffler AG in good faith.

The Key Performance Indicators are calculated internally by Schaeffler AG based on broadly accepted
industry standards and guidelines, namely the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard as published by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development, as amended from time to time, or any generally accepted standard (i.e. in
the good faith determination of the Issuer) which replaces the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard. These standards and guidelines may change over time, which may affect the
way in which Schaeffler AG calculates the Key Performance Indicators from time to time or the
achievement of any such Sustainability Performance Goal, including the Sustainability Performance
Target or any Sustainability Performance Level (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Definitions”) applicable to the Notes. The standards and guidelines continue to be reviewed by expert_
groups and include contributions from industry bodies, which may change going forward and may
result in a change of the methods and procedures used to determine the Key Performance Indicators.
A structural change in Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries, including as a result of acquisitions or
mergers, investments or disposals and/or any other event following which any recalculation is
evaluated by Schaeffler AG, may result in a change in the Sustainability Performance Target and/or
the Sustainability Performance Levels. See “Description of the Notes—Interest—Sustainability
_Performance Target Step-up Interest—Sustainability Adjustments.”_

For the interest payment period commencing on, 2026 and any interest period thereafter, the
interest rate applicable for such periods on the Notes shall increase by 0.25% per annum unless the
Issuer has notified the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent(s)) by way of an officer’s
certificate, which shall also include a Sustainability Report (as defined below), on or prior to the
Certification Date, confirming that the Schaeffler Group has achieved the Sustainability Performance
Target. Promptly upon notifying the Trustee that the Schaeffler Group has achieved the Sustainability
Performance Target, the Issuer will also publish on a website of, or designated by, the Issuer that the
Schaeffler Group has achieved the Sustainability Performance Target. See “Description of the Notes—
_Interest—Sustainability Performance Target Step-up Interest.” In addition, for redemption of the_
Notes in connection with certain optional redemptions, the applicable redemption price shall be
adjusted as described herein unless the Issuer has notified the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant
Paying Agent(s)) in writing at least five days prior to giving the relevant redemption notice that a
certain Sustainability Performance Level has been achieved. See “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption.” The Scope 1+2 2030 Performance Goal and the Scope 3 2030 Performance Goal will_
not apply to the Notes and a failure to achieve these targets will not result in a step-up in the interest
rate or any adjustments to the redemption price of the Notes.

Schaeffler AG publishes a report annually on certain non-financial reporting items in accordance with
§315c in conjunction with §289c to §289e of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch;
HGB) which is meant to include the performance of Schaeffler AG in respect of the Key Performance
Indicators in the respective fiscal year to which the Sustainability Report relates, and the application
of any recalculation procedure where relevant (the “Sustainability Report”). Schaeffler AG may
publish its annual Sustainability Report either as a standalone document or as part of its annual
report or include it in any other document published by Schaeffler AG. The Sustainability Report will
also include a verification assurance statement (“limited assurance”), with respect to the
performance of the items which comprise the KPIs and the KPIs themselves during the relevant fiscal
year. In addition, the Issuer intends to publish annually and keep readily available and easily
accessible on a website of or designated by the Issuer, a report providing information on the
development of the Scope 1+2 KPI (the “Key Performance Indicator Report”) and any adjustments to
the Sustainability Performance Target, Sustainability Performance Levels or Baseline Scope 1+2 GHG
Emissions, where applicable. The Key Performance Indicator Report will be separate from, and in
addition to, the reporting required under the Indenture for the Notes. The Framework can be found

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The Notes may not be a suitable
_investment for all investors seeking exposure to assets with sustainability characteristics,” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Even if we meet the initial Sustainability_
_Performance Goals, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet our Sustainability_
_Performance Goals thereafter. There will be limited consequences under the Indenture for our failure_
_to maintain the Sustainability Performance Goals.”_

### The Restricted Group

As of the Issue Date, the restrictive covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes (the
“Indenture”) will only apply to the Issuer and not to any of its subsidiaries. Schaeffler AG and its
subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) of the Issuer. As a result,
Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries or any future subsidiaries that are designated as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, will not guarantee the
Notes and will not provide any collateral securing the Notes.

As a consequence, holders of the Notes (“Note Holders”) will have no recourse to any Unrestricted
Subsidiary (including Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries), its assets or its properties if there is an event
of default under the Indenture. Investments of a member of the restricted group in the unrestricted
group, such as equity investments or provision of loans, are subject to certain restrictions under the
Indenture. See “Description of the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes and our

## Summary of the Offering

The following is a brief summary of certain terms of the Offering and may not contain all the
information that is important to an investor. For additional information regarding the Notes, see
“Description of the Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Issuer—
_Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Issuer ............................................................** IHO Verwaltungs GmbH, a limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) organized
under the laws of Germany, with its registered office
in Herzogenaurach, Germany.

**Notes Offered ..............................................** €500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount
of      % /      % sustainability-linked senior
secured PIK toggle notes due 2028 (the “Notes”).

**Issue Date .....................................................**, 2023.

**Issue Price ....................................................** %, plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue
Date.

**Maturity Date .........................................**, 2028.

**Interest Rates and Payment Dates ..............** The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semiannually in arrears on           and           of
each year, beginning on          , 2023. The first
two and the final interest payments on the Notes
will be made in cash. For each other interest period,
the Issuer will be required to pay interest on the
Notes entirely in cash (“Cash Interest”), unless the
conditions described in this Offering Memorandum
are satisfied, in which case the Issuer will be entitled
to pay, to the extent described herein, interest for
such interest period by increasing the principal
amount of the Notes or issuing Additional PIK Notes
(such increase or issuance being referred to herein
as “PIK Interest”). For additional information on the
requirement to pay Cash Interest or a combination
of Cash Interest and PIK Interest, see “Description of
_the Notes—Interest.”_

Cash Interest on the Notes will initially accrue at the
rate of      % per annum (the “Cash Interest
**Rate”). PIK Interest will accrue at the then applicable**
Cash Interest Rate plus 0.75% per annum. Interest
on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date. If the
Issuer pays all eligible interest in PIK Interest, it will
increase the principal amount of the Notes or issue
Additional PIK Notes in relation to the Notes, in a
principal amount up to a maximum of €      million
(assuming Step-up Interest is not payable) or
€      million (assuming Step-up Interest is
payable).


-----

**Sustainability Performance Target Step-up**
**Interest .........................................................**


For the interest payment period commencing
on          , 2026 and any interest period
thereafter, the interest rate applicable for such
periods on the Notes shall increase by 0.25% per
annum (such additional interest payable, the “Step**up Interest”) unless the Issuer has notified the**
Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent(s))
by way of an officer’s certificate, which shall also
include a Sustainability Report, on or prior to the
Certification Date, confirming that the Schaeffler
Group has achieved the Sustainability Performance
Target for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025,
each as defined and further described under
“Description of the Notes—Interest—Sustainability
_Performance Target Step-up Interest.”_


**Form and Denomination ........................** The Notes will be issued in global form in
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1 in excess thereof, maintained in book-entry
form.

**Ranking of the Notes ...................................** The Notes:

                      - will be general senior obligations of the

Issuer;

                      - will, together with the obligations under the
Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
obligations, be secured by the Collateral as
described below under “—Security;”

                      - will be structurally subordinated to any
existing and future obligations of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries, including indebtedness of the
Schaeffler OpCo Group;

                      - will be effectively subordinated to any
existing and future obligations of the Issuer
that are secured by property or assets that do
not secure the Notes, to the extent of the
value of property and assets securing such
obligations;

                      - will rank pari passu in right of payment with
all existing and future obligations of the Issuer
that are not subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes, including obligations of the
Issuer in respect of the Existing Issuer Notes
and the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement;

                      - will rank senior in right of payment to all

existing and future obligations of the Issuer


-----

that are subordinated in right of payment to
the Notes (if any); and

                      - will be effectively senior to any existing or
future obligation of the Issuer that are not
secured by the Collateral owned by the Issuer
to the extent of the value of such Collateral.

**Security.........................................................** Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and
the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement, the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes will initially be secured by pledges over:

                      - 333,000,001 common shares in Schaeffler AG
(representing 66.6% of the voting shares
(Stammaktien) and 50.0% plus one share of
the total share capital of Schaeffler AG) held
by the Issuer;

                      - 48,742,194 common shares in Continental AG
held by the Issuer (representing 24.4% of the
total share capital of Continental AG); and

                      - 9,748,439 common shares in Vitesco AG held
by the Issuer (representing 24.4% of the total
share capital of Vitesco AG).

The Collateral securing the Notes will rank
effectively pari passu with the liens securing
obligations outstanding under the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement, the Existing Issuer Notes,
certain hedging obligations and any future
indebtedness that is permitted under the Indenture
to share the Collateral. While the pledges on the
Collateral securing the Notes will be created later in
time and will thus be lower ranking in rem, the
Issuer’s security pooling and intercreditor
agreement (the “Issuer Security Pooling and
**Intercreditor Agreement”) provides that any**
proceeds received from enforcement of the Security
Documents will be shared equally and ratably
between the holders of the Notes and any other
indebtedness that is or becomes subject to the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement,
including the Existing Issuer Notes and indebtedness
under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement
and certain hedging obligations. See “Description of
_the Notes—Security.”_

Liens over assets forming part of the Collateral will
be automatically released under the indenture
under certain circumstances, including upon the
release of any and all liens over such assets (other
than permitted liens) securing other debt, including


-----

debt under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that, for so long as the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement
(or any additional security pooling and intercreditor
agreement) is in effect, on or after the occurrence of
an enforcement action under the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, all payments
in respect of the Notes may only be made to the
Security Trustee (and the Trustee and, subject to the
terms of the Indenture, the holders of the Notes
may make demands or claims under the Notes only
to the effect that such payments be made to the
Security Trustee) for application pursuant to the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement
or any additional security pooling and intercreditor
agreement, as the case may be.

The Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee and
holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Trustee
to take enforcement action. The Security Trustee
will act only upon the instruction of an Instructing
Group (as defined below). A resolution to instruct
the Security Trustee to act under the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement will be passed
if the total principal amount of notes that are
subject to the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement (initially, the Notes offered
in the Offering and the Existing Issuer Notes) and
the total amount of commitments under facilities
agreements that are subject to the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement (initially, the
Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement), in each
case, that vote (or are deemed to have voted) in
favor of the resolution exceeds the total principal
amount of notes and the total amount of
commitments under facilities agreements that vote
(or are deemed to have voted) against the
resolution. In calculating votes, the Security Trustee
will convert into euro votes representing any notes
or commitments denominated in currencies other
than euro. Any decision, instruction or consent that
is required pursuant to the Issuer Security Pooling
and Intercreditor Agreement to be made by
resolution in the foregoing manner is referred to as
a decision, instruction or consent of the “Instructing
**Group.” See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the**
_Notes and our Structure—Note Holders will be able_
_to direct the enforcement of the Collateral only_
_under certain limited circumstances,” “Description of_
_Other Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Issuer—_


-----

_Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor_
_Agreement—Enforcement of Transaction Security,”_
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Indebtedness
_of the Issuer—Issuer Security Pooling and_
_Intercreditor Agreement—Decisions of the_
_Instructing Group” and “Description of the Notes—_
_Security—Enforcement of security.”_

**Optional Redemption ..................................** The Notes will be redeemable at the Issuer’s option,
in whole or in part, at any time on or
after          , 2025 at the redemption prices set
forth in this Offering Memorandum, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
redemption.

At any time prior to          , 2025, the Issuer
may redeem some or all of the Notes, at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest plus a “make-whole” premium.

In addition, prior to          , 2025,the Issuer may
redeem at its option up to 40% of the original
principal amount of the Notes, with proceeds of
certain equity offerings.

See “Description of the Notes—Optional
_redemption.”_


**Sustainability Performance Target**
**Principal Redemption Premium ............**


For redemption of the Notes in connection with
certain optional redemptions, the applicable
redemption price shall be adjusted as described
herein unless the Issuer has notified the Trustee
(with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent(s)) in
writing at least five days prior to giving the relevant
redemption notice that a certain Sustainability
Performance Level has been achieved. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional redemption.”


**Tender Offers .......................................** In connection with certain tender offers for the
Notes, including in connection with an offer to
repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of
certain events constituting a change of control, if
holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and
do not withdraw such Notes and the Issuer, or any
third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the
Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the
Issuer or such third party will have the right to
redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole,
but not in part, following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other holder of
Notes.


-----

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons ......** The Issuer may also redeem the Notes at any time,
in whole but not in part, for reasons of taxation, if as
a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws
or regulations (including any amendment to, or
change in, an official interpretation or application of
such laws or regulations) of any Tax Jurisdiction (as
defined in “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts”) in respect of the Issuer affecting taxation_
or the obligation to pay duties of any kind, the Issuer
will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts on
the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Redemption for changes in taxes.”_

**Original Issue Discount ................................** The Notes will be issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes
because none of the stated interest on the Notes
will constitute “qualified stated interest.” As a
result, U.S. Holders (as defined under “Taxation—
_U.S. Taxation”) will be required to include the_
amounts representing the OID in gross income (as
ordinary income) generally on a constant yield basis,
potentially in advance of receipt of the cash
payments to which such income is attributable,
regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For
a discussion of the material tax consequences of an
investment in the Notes, see “Taxation—U.S.
_Taxation.”_

**Additional Amounts .....................................** Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer
under or with respect to the Notes will be made
without withholding or deduction for taxes unless
required by law. If the Issuer is required by law to
withhold or deduct for taxes in any Tax Jurisdiction
(as defined under “Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts”) with respect to a payment to_
the holders of the Notes, the Issuer will pay the
Additional Amounts necessary so that the net
amount received by the holders of the Notes after
the withholding or deduction is not less than the
amount that would have been received in the
absence of the withholding, subject to certain
exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts.”_

**Change of Control ........................................** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control
events, the Issuer will be required to offer to
repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of such repurchase. See
“Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the option
_of Holders—Change of Control.”_


-----

**Certain Covenants ........................................** The Indenture will limit, among other things, the
ability of the Issuer to:

                      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness

and issue certain preferred stock;

                      - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase its

capital stock;

                      - make certain restricted payments and
investments, including dividends or other
distributions with regard to the shares of the
Issuer;

                      - create or incur certain liens;

                      - enter into agreements that restrict any
restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay
dividends;

                      - transfer or sell assets;

                      - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                      - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

and

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of

the holders of the Notes.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of
important exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain covenants.”

As of the Issue Date, the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture will apply only to the Issuer and not to
any of its subsidiaries. Schaeffler AG and its
subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Indenture) of the Issuer. As a result,
Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries or any future
subsidiaries that are designated as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive
covenants in the Indenture. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_related to the Notes and our Structure—Schaeffler_
_AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries under the Indenture and will not be_
_subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture,_
_will not guarantee the Notes and will not provide_
_any Collateral.”_

Securities Act. The Notes may only be offered or
sold in a transaction exempt from or not subject to
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act. In addition, the offer and the sale of the Notes
and the distribution of offering materials relating
thereto are subject to specific restrictions as set out
under “Important Information about this Offering
_Memorandum” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_

**Use of Proceeds ...........................................** The Issuer intends to use the gross proceeds from
the Offering, together with cash at banks, (i) to
redeem €500 million in principal amount of the
Existing 2025 Euro Notes and pay accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, up until the applicable
redemption date and (ii) to pay fees and expenses
related to the Offering and the Issuer Notes
Redemption. The Issuer expects to redeem the
Redeemed Issuer Notes on or about May 15, 2023.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

**No Prior Market ...........................................** The Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no market. Although the Initial Purchasers
have informed us that they intend to make a market
in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and
may discontinue market-making at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that an
active trading market for the Notes will develop or
be maintained.

Official List of the LuxSE and to admit the Notes to

_case may be, or is based on calculations of figures of the abovementioned sources._

_The summary financial information presented below includes certain non-GAAP measures and ratios,_
_which are used by management in monitoring Schaeffler AG’s business. Non-GAAP measures may not_
_be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as_

** Effective as of January 1, 2022, we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022). As a result, starting in 2022, we began reporting earnings before financial result and income taxes (EBIT) to
include income (loss) from equity-accounted investees. Figures for 2021 have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. EBIT
and related figures for 2020 have not been adjusted retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully comparable to the figures for
subsequent periods. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and

- Figures for 2020 have been adjusted retrospectively for certain accounting changes we implemented effective as of January 1, 2021
and have been taken from the comparative figures for 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Comparability—Accounting Policy_
_Changes.”_

(1) Until December 1, 2021, we defined “EBIT” as earnings before financial result, income (loss) from equity-accounted investees, and
income taxes. Starting in 2022, we began reporting earnings before financial result and income taxes (EBIT) to include income (loss)
from equity-accounted investees. Figures for 2021 have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. EBIT and related figures
for 2020 have not been adjusted retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully comparable to the figures for subsequent periods. We
define “Adjusted EBIT” as EBIT before special items, which are items which management considers to render the financial indicators
less meaningful for evaluating the sustainability of our profitability due to their nature, frequency and/or size. Adjusted EBIT is not a
performance indicator recognized under IFRS. The Adjusted EBIT figures presented are not necessarily comparable to the performance
figures published by other companies as Adjusted EBIT or the like. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP
_Financial Measures.” The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBIT and Adjusted EBIT for the periods below:_

(2) We define EBIT margin, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin as EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, divided by revenue.

(3) We define “EBITDA” (earnings before financial result, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments) as the aggregate of
(i) EBIT and (ii) depreciation, amortization (excluding write-downs of investments) and impairment losses. We define “Adjusted
**EBITDA” as EBITDA before special items, which are items which management considers to render the financial indicators less**
meaningful for evaluating the sustainability of our profitability due to their nature, frequency and/or size. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
are not performance indicators recognized under IFRS. The EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA figures presented are not necessarily
comparable to the performance figures published by other companies as EBITDA or the like. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and ratios and
other measures based thereon presented in this Offering Memorandum are defined and calculated differently from the definition of
“Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indenture. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial
_Measures.”_ The following is a reconciliation of EBIT to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods below:

(6) We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities, cash flow used in investing activities and principal repayments on lease
liabilities. We define free cash flow before payments for M&A activities as free cash flow, plus cash used for acquisition of subsidiaries,
less proceeds from disposal of subsidiaries. We define free cash flow conversion ratio as the ratio of free cash flow before cash in- and
outflows for M&A activities to EBIT. The following table sets forth our free cash flow and our free cash flow before payments for M&A

_consolidated historical financial information for the Schaeffler Group as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2022. The basis of preparation for this information is set forth in “Presentation of_
_Financial and Other Information—Pro Forma Financial Information.”_

_The tables below also contain certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the Issuer and for_
_the Schaeffler Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which has been adjusted to_
_reflect certain effects of (i) in the case of the Issuer, the Refinancing and (ii) in the case of the_
_Schaeffler Group, certain effects of the Ewellix Acquisition (as defined under “Management’s_

(1) The historical Issuer financial information has been compiled based on the Issuer Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements and the
unaudited accounting records of the Issuer, in accordance with German GAAP. The Issuer financial information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and has not been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Pro Forma Financial Information.”

(2) Cash dividends received reflect cash dividends received by the Issuer from Schaeffler AG of €245 million and from Continental AG of
€117 million (net of a withholding tax of €42 million, which is expected to be credited against the corporate income tax liability for
2022, and to the extent exceeding corporate income tax liability, it is expected to be reimbursed in 2023). The annual general meeting
of shareholders of Vitesco AG, held on May 5, 2022, resolved that the retained earnings for the year 2021 be carried forward and no
dividends be paid for that year. In the invitation to its annual general meeting of shareholders for 2023, the boards of Schaeffler AG
proposed dividends of €0.44 per common voting share (which would amount to aggregate dividends of €220 million with respect to
the common voting shares held by the Issuer). In its preliminary results release for 2022, Continental AG stated its management board
had resolved to propose dividends of €1.50 per common share (which would amount to aggregate dividends of €80 million expected to
be received by the Issuer in 2023 (net of an expected withholding tax of €28 million, which is expected to be credited against the
corporate income tax liability for 2023, and to the extent exceeding corporate income tax liability, it is expected to be reimbursed in
2024) with respect to the common shares held by the Issuer) to its annual general meeting. Vitesco AG indicated that it will carry
forward its retained earnings for the year 2022 and pay no dividends for 2022 during its capital markets day presentation on October
11, 2022. If the Schaeffler AG and Continental AG dividends are approved as proposed, this would result in aggregate dividends
expected to be received by the Issuer in 2023 of €300 million. The annual general meetings of shareholders of Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG and Vitesco AG are scheduled to be held on April 20, April 27 and May 17, 2023, respectively. There can be no
assurance that the annual general meetings of shareholders will resolve on the dividends as proposed or that there will not be further
reductions in dividends the Issuer receives in the future or that any dividends will be paid at all.


-----

(3) _Pro forma financial debt is the financial debt as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Refinancing as if the Refinancing had occurred_
on December 31, 2022. Actual financial debt of the Issuer consists of debt outstanding under the Issuer Revolving Facility (€160 million)
and the Existing Issuer Notes (including the Redeemed Issuer Notes) (€3,316 million equivalent). Pro forma financial debt of the Issuer
consists of debt outstanding under the Issuer Revolving Facility (€160 million), the Existing Issuer Notes (other than the Redeemed
Issuer Notes) (€2,816 million-equivalent) and the Notes offered hereby (€500 million). For presentational purposes, the U.S. dollar
tranches of the Existing Issuer Notes have been converted into euro at an exchange rate of $1.0666 to €1.00 as of December 31, 2022.
Actual and pro forma financial debt does not include the €550 million subordinated shareholder loan granted by IHO Beteiligung to the
Issuer; see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transactions of the Issuer—Subordinated Shareholder Loans.”
Actual and pro forma financial debt represent principal amounts.

(4) _Pro forma cash at banks represents cash at banks as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the sources and uses of cash in connection_
with the Refinancing as described under “Use of Proceeds,” in each case as if they occurred on December 31, 2022.

(5) Actual net financial debt represents actual gross financial debt less actual cash at banks. Pro forma net financial debt represents pro
_forma gross financial debt less pro forma cash at banks._

(6) The Issuer’s net interest paid is calculated as interest paid less interest received. The Issuer’s pro forma net interest paid is defined as
the accumulated net interest paid in the year ended December 31, 2022, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Refinancing, as if
the Refinancing had occurred on January 1, 2022. Pro forma net interest paid is actual net interest paid for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (€142 million), adjusted by adding interest payments of €[] million relating to the Notes, and by deducting
interest payments of €18 million relating to the Redeemed Issuer Notes.

(7) The historical Schaeffler Group financial information has been compiled based on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2022,
in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Pro Forma Financial Information.”

(8) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (earnings before financial result, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments)
before special items, which are items which management considers to render the financial indicators less meaningful for evaluating
the sustainability of our profitability due to their nature, frequency and/or size. We define EBITDA as the aggregate of (i) EBIT and (ii)
depreciation, amortization (excluding write-downs of investments) and impairment losses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not
performance indicators recognized under IFRS. The EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA figures presented are not necessarily comparable to
the performance figures published by other companies as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or the like. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and ratios
and other measures based thereon presented in this Offering Memorandum are defined and calculated differently from the definition
of “Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indenture. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial
_Measures.” For a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote (3) under “—Other Financial and_
_Operating Data—Schaeffler AG.” Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA has not been adjusted to reflect the Ewellix Acquisition._

(9) Financial debt does not include lease liabilities, which amounted to €219 million as of December 31, 2022. Pro forma financial debt
reflects actual financial debt adjusted for the incurrence of €500 million under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility to finance the
Ewellix Acquisition, of which €350 million were drawn in January 2023 and €150 million are expected to be drawn in March 2023 to
replenish a portion of the cash we used for the Ewellix Acquisition in January 2023, as well as €3 million of acquired Ewellix debt. Pro
_forma net financial debt represents pro forma gross financial debt_ less pro forma cash and cash equivalents.

(10) Actual cash and cash equivalents excludes €7 million of cash and cash equivalents held for sale. Pro Forma cash and cash equivalents
reflects actual cash and cash equivalents, as adjusted for the use of cash (net of acquired cash) in connection with the closing of the
Ewellix Acquisition in January 2023 and the proceeds of the expected drawing under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility in March
2023. The Ewellix Acquisition was funded in January 2023 from €350 million in drawings under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility
and cash on hand of €352 million, while we acquired €21 million of cash in connection with the Ewellix Acquisition. We expect to draw
€150 million under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan in March 2023 to replenish a portion of the cash we used for the Ewellix
Acquisition in January 2023.

(11) Pro forma net interest paid has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to the incurrence of €500 million under the Schaeffler Group
Term Loan Facility. Pro forma net interest paid consists of actual net interest paid for the year ended December 31, 2022 (€92 million),
adjusted by adding interest payments of €23 million relating to the drawing of €350 million under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan
Facility in January 2023 and relating to the expected drawing of €150 million under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility in March
2023 as if each had occurred on January 1, 2022 and based on the interest rate in effect on January 2, 2023 for the drawing of €350
million in January 2023 and assuming the same interest rate for the expected drawing of €150 million in March 2023. No adjustments
are reflected to determine pro forma net interest paid for actual commitment fees paid relating to the Schaeffler Group Term Loan
Facility or the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility or for actual interest payments received for cash and cash equivalents.

(12) Pro forma Combined Net Leverage Ratio is calculated on a combined and “look-through” basis as the Issuer’s ownership percentage of
the pro forma net financial debt of the Schaeffler Group plus the pro forma net financial debt of the Issuer, divided by the Issuer’s
ownership percentage of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Schaeffler Group plus dividends received by the Issuer from Continental AG in
2022 (net of a withholding tax).

(13) Pro forma Combined Coverage Ratio is calculated on a combined and “look-through” basis as the Issuer’s ownership percentage of the
Adjusted EBITDA of the Schaeffler Group plus dividends received by the Issuer from Continental AG in 2022 (net of a withholding tax),
divided by the Issuer’s ownership percentage of the pro forma net interest paid by the Schaeffler Group plus the pro forma net interest
paid by the Issuer.

(14) This amount reflects the volume weighted average price per non-voting share of Schaeffler AG quoted on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
over the last 60 trading days (the “Schaeffler AG Share Value”) on March 16, 2023 (€6.63), multiplied by the number of common
voting Schaeffler AG shares held by the Issuer (500,000,000).

(15) As of the Issue Date, the Notes, the Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer Revolving Facility and certain hedging obligations will initially be
secured by pledges over 333,000,001 common shares in Schaeffler AG (representing 66.6% of the voting shares (Stammaktien) and
50.0% plus one share of the total share capital of Schaeffler AG). Based on the Schaeffler AG Share Value of €6.63, the shares in
Schaeffler AG forming part of the Collateral had a total market value of €2,208 million as of March 16, 2023.


-----

(16) This amount reflects the volume weighted average price per share of Continental AG quoted on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the
last 60 trading days (the “Continental AG Share Value”) on March 16, 2023 (€67.43), multiplied by the number of Continental AG
shares held by the Issuer (71,990,458).

(17) As of the Issue Date, the Notes, the Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer Revolving Facility and certain hedging obligations will be secured
by pledges over 48,742,194 common shares in Continental AG (representing 24.4% of the total share capital of Continental AG). Based
on the Continental AG Share Value of €67.43, the shares in Continental AG forming part of the Collateral had a total market value of
€3,287 million as of March 16, 2023.

(18) This amount reflects the volume weighted average price per share of Vitesco AG quoted on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the last
60 trading days (the “Vitesco AG Share Value”) on March 16, 2023 (€62.89), multiplied by the number of Vitesco AG shares held by the
Issuer (15,984,093).

(19) As of the Issue Date, the Notes, the Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer Revolving Facility and certain hedging obligations will be secured
by pledges over 9,748,439 common shares in Vitesco AG (representing 24.4% of the total share capital of Vitesco AG). Based on the
Vitesco AG Share Value of €62.89, the shares in Vitesco AG forming part of the Collateral had a total market value of €613 million as of
March 16, 2023.

(20) The pro forma LTV Ratio is calculated as the pro forma (gross) financial debt of the Issuer as of December 31, 2022, divided by an
amount equal to (i) the Schaeffler AG Share Value on March 16, 2023 (€6.63) multiplied by the number of Schaeffler AG shares held by
the Issuer (500,000,000) plus (ii) the Continental AG Share Value on March 16, 2023 (€67.43) multiplied by the number of Continental
AG shares held by the Issuer (71,990,458) plus (iii) the Vitesco AG Share Value on March 16, 2023 (€62.89) multiplied by the number of
Vitesco AG shares held by the Issuer (15,984,093).

(21) The pro forma Collateral LTV Ratio is calculated as the pro forma (gross) financial debt of the Issuer as of December 31, 2022, divided
by an amount equal to (i) the Schaeffler AG Share Value on March 16, 2023 (€6.63) multiplied by the number of Schaeffler AG shares
(333,000,001) forming part of the Collateral plus (ii) the Continental AG Share Value on March 16, 2023 (€67.43) multiplied by the
number of Continental AG shares (48,742,194) forming part of the Collateral plus (iii) the Vitesco AG Share Value on March 16, 2023
(€62.89) multiplied by the number of Vitesco AG shares (9,748,439) forming part of the Collateral. As of December 31, 2022, €160
million was drawn under the Issuer Revolving Facility. If the Issuer Revolving Facility were fully drawn (€800 million) as of the Issue
Date, the pro forma Collateral LTV Ratio would be 1.0 to 1.5.

## Risk Factors

_An investment in the Notes is subject to risks. In addition to the other information contained in this_
_Offering Memorandum, investors should carefully consider the following risks when deciding whether_
_to invest in the Notes. The market price of the Notes could decline if any of these risks were to_
_materialize, in which case investors could lose some or all of their investment. The following risks,_
_alone or together with additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we might_
_currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial_
_condition, cash flows and results of operations and may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to fulfill its_
_obligations under the Notes as well as the ability of investors to obtain the proceeds from the_
_enforcement of other collateral which might be provided for the obligations under the Notes. The_
_COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine add significant uncertainty to our operating environment_
_and may have the effect of magnifying the risks and uncertainties we describe below._

_Except as the context otherwise indicates, in the sub-sections entitled “—Risks related to our Business_
_Operations and the Markets in which we operate” and “—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks,” the terms_
_“we,” “us,” “our” and other similar terms are generally used to refer to Schaeffler AG and its_
_subsidiaries, whereas in the sub-sections entitled “—Risks related to our Financing” and “—Risks_
_related to the Notes and our Structure,” the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and other similar terms are_
_generally used to refer to the Issuer and its subsidiaries._

_The order in which the risks are presented is not an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually_
_materializing, or the significance or degree of the risks or the scope of any potential harm to our_
_business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The risks mentioned_
_herein may materialize individually or cumulatively._

### Risks related to our Business Operations and the Markets in which we operate

**_As a global supplier to the automotive and industrial sectors we are exposed to substantial risks_**
**_associated with the performance of the global economy, political uncertainty and the performance_**
**_of the economy in the regions in which we operate._**

We are a global supplier to the automotive and industrial sectors. Thus, we are exposed to
substantial risks associated with the performance of the global economy. In general, demand for
automotive products and services as well as for the industrial sectors is directly related to the
strength of the global economy. Therefore, our revenues and profit have been influenced, and will
continue to be influenced, to a certain degree, by the general state and the performance of the
global economy. Rising inflation, the recent move towards more restrictive monetary and fiscal
policy, particularly in the EU and the United States, escalation of conflicts (in particular the war in
Ukraine), deglobalization and the associated decoupling of global supply chains, persistent supply
shortages in raw materials, intermediate products and transport capacities, decreased energy
availability, high energy prices and restructuring of energy policies, protectionist tendencies, terrorist
activities, natural disasters or the spread of infectious diseases (such as COVID-19, see “—The COVID_19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations_
_and cash flows.”) can result in shocks to the global economy and declines in demand for our products_
and services. The outlook for the world economy remains subject to uncertainty, particularly in light
of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and central bank measures seeking to contain inflation, which
may lead to prolonged periods of economic uncertainty in many of our geographies. This geopolitical
and economic uncertainty may affect our business’ sales and the procurement markets.

Our business is subject to risks from international conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, and other
geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, such as the rising tensions between Russia and Sweden,


-----

Russia and Finland, increased military activity in the Baltic Sea and any potential increase in
geopolitical tensions in Asia, particularly relating to Taiwan. The war in Ukraine, in particular, has and
may continue to have a significant impact on the economic environment and our customers’
business. We generated (i) 0.9%, 0.9% and 0.2% of our revenues in Russia in 2020, 2021 and 2022,
respectively, (ii) 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.01% of our revenues in Belarus in 2020, 2021 and 2022,
respectively, and (iii) 0.2%, 0.2% and 0.1% of our revenues in Ukraine in 2020, 2021 and 2022,
respectively. We reduced production at our plant in Ulyanovsk, Russia (98 employees in Russia) to
the minimum possible in order to continue to meet our contractual delivery obligations, and ceased
the operations of our Automotive Aftermarket and Industrial Divisions in Russia. We had also sourced
certain raw materials, such as steel, from sources in Russia, which we discontinued after the
outbreak of the war, and had utilized shipping routes between Europe and China that crossed
through Russia, which we have re-routed. In addition, we entered into an agreement for the sale of
our two Russian subsidiaries, which is subject to approval by the Russian authorities. In Ukraine,
though our sales office in Kyiv (six employees in Ukraine) was initially closed, our operations in
Ukraine have resumed. While our direct exposure to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine has been relatively
limited, we will continue to monitor the impacts of the war in Ukraine on macroeconomic conditions
and continually assess the effect these matters may have on our businesses and compliance
obligations.

The war in Ukraine, related rapidly evolving and increasingly severe economic sanctions and export
controls imposed on Russia and certain Russian companies, individuals, and allies as well as related
Russian countermeasures and countersanctions, have severely restricted the level of economic
activity in Russia and Ukraine, increased volatility and uncertainty in the global financial markets,
disrupted supply chains, resulted in price slumps for products, significant increases in the prices of
many raw materials and energy and adversely affected the operations of many of our customers. A
number of companies, including ourselves and a number of our customers, have announced plans to
divest interests or otherwise curtail business dealings in Russia and/or with Russian businesses, or
have been required to halt, reduce or delay production due to the unavailability of raw materials or
components, such as springs and friction linings, which adversely affects those customers’ demands
for our products. In addition, a lack of preliminary products from the Ukraine led to production
disruptions in Europe, particularly in Germany. The ramifications of the war in Ukraine and related
economic sanctions and export controls, may not be limited to Russia, Ukraine and Russian and
Ukrainian companies, and may also negatively impact other regional and global economic markets
(including Europe and the U.S.), companies in other countries (particularly those that were previously
doing business with Russia and Ukraine), various sectors, industries, securities markets and
commodities globally (such as oil, natural gas, engineering, and metals and mining), global supply
chains, inflation, growth in gross domestic product (“GDP”) and possibly lead to rationing of gas
supplies.

Further economic sanctions could also be imposed on countries, companies or persons that seek to,
or are perceived to, circumvent existing economic sanctions or provide military or other support to
Russia, which could further exacerbate these risks. In addition, Russia has taken and may take
additional retaliatory actions and other countermeasures, including restricting gas exports, seizure of
the assets of U.S. and European companies and persons located in Russia or territories under its
control, cyberattacks and espionage against other countries and companies, or undertaking or
provoking other military conflict elsewhere, any of which may negatively impact our customers and
the countries in which we operate. While we cannot currently reliably predict the direct or indirect
impact that the war in Ukraine or any related international economic sanctions may have on our
business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, we caution investors that they
could be material and adverse.

Also, in response to rising inflation and increased concerns with regards to an economic recession,
some governments have raised interest rates and/or curtailed quantitative easing policies and


-----

indicated their intention to continue to do so. The inflationary environment and resulting wage and
production cost pressure and price increases (in particular due to rising energy costs) combined with
rising interest rates, may lower purchasing power and result in declining customer demand, and
significantly impact our results of operations. A failure to accurately anticipate and factor rising
inflation into our product pricing assumptions may also result in mispricing of our products, which
could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Rising interest rates are likely to
have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, the financial condition of our customers and
the financial condition of the end customers who ultimately create demand for the products we
supply, all of which could negatively affect demand for our products. Higher interest rates also
increase our financing costs, which may weaken demand and impact our ability to execute on our
growth strategies or future acquisitions or finance the increased costs.

China’s economic health, including its present debt situation and potential market disruptions due to
ongoing and iterative COVID-19 measures such as the lockdowns that continued into 2023, which
negatively affected demand in China and led to supply chain disruptions, potentially presents
additional economics and political uncertainty. Further, the current coalition government in Germany
has signaled a shift in foreign policy that could lead to increased trade tensions between Germany
and China, and though the United States and China reached a trade agreement, an escalation of
trade tensions between the United States and China or Germany and/or Europe and China, including
if China is, or is perceived to, provide support to Russia in the war in Ukraine or to circumvent
economic sanctions imposed against Russia and its allies, may result in further uncertainty in the
global economy and may jeopardize economic growth in China.

Additional risks to the economic environment, international trade and demand for our products
could also arise from rising protectionist tendencies, which could result in, inter alia, higher customs
charges. Increasing protectionism in trade policy or changes in the political and regulatory
environment in markets in which we do business can impact our net assets, financial position and
results of operations. Import/export control regulations, customs regulations and other trade
barriers can also bring sales in individual countries to a complete standstill. See also “—The
_imposition of tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers on automobiles and other goods could have a material_
_adverse effect on us.” These and other changes in trade policies could trigger additional retaliatory_
actions, resulting in “trade wars.”

There also continues to be uncertainty about a potential deterioration of the sovereign debt of
several Eurozone countries, particularly in the context of rising interest rates, which could also affect
more stable countries and adversely affect the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union.
Political developments and uncertainties in certain European countries, such as the election or
appointment of Eurosceptic governments, could further exacerbate these uncertainties.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Prices of many of our raw materials and energy have increased significantly and may rise further,_**
**_which may lead to higher production and manufacturing costs._**

Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of raw materials and energy, the costs of
which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Steel
is the principal raw material used in many of our products. Price increases for raw materials, as well
as energy, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise, may
affect the production and manufacturing costs of our products, and we may not be able to pass those
costs on to our customers. The prices of nearly all our significant input materials, including steel,
aluminum, copper and plastic as well as energy prices increased significantly in 2021 and 2022. For
example, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel reached its all-time high in 2021, in Europe, natural


-----

gas prices reached historic highs in August 2022, natural gas and electricity saw annual average prices
of 136% in Europe and 75% in the U.S. in 2022 as compared to 2021.

In addition, the war in Ukraine and the related economic sanctions and export controls could
exacerbate the rising inflation trend, further increase energy and raw material prices and negatively
impact global supply chains. For example, as a result of the war in Ukraine, oil prices recently reached
multi-year highs with the average price of crude oil reaching prices approximately 42% higher than in
2021 and governments have considered restructuring their energy policies. For example, the U.S.
government has prohibited the import of Russian oil into the U.S., and both the U.S. and the EU have
imposed price caps on the purchase of certain Russian petroleum products. In the event that Russia
stops the export of energy sources to the EU or as a result of embargos on Russian energy sources,
emergency measures may be implemented to conserve energy, which could include shutting down
non-critical industries or rationing energy supply, and we could be required to reduce our energy
consumption by, for example, reducing or stopping production at one or more of our production
locations in the EU.

Freight and logistics costs have also grown significantly since 2020, due to a number of factors,
including persistent transport capacity shortages, imbalances in global trade and countries locking
down and reopening at different times due to varying patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks and the war in
Ukraine, which resulted in changes to our shipping routes between Europe and China, in order to
avoid transit through Russia. The difficult situation on the transport market has also impacted our net
working capital development. Longer transport times have caused an increase in goods in transit,
while specific shortages have also caused imbalances within our stock. In certain areas we have
intentionally increased stock to cover certain volatilities and secure supply, but this has been limited
by the material shortages.

In addition to fixing purchase prices for certain of our raw materials, such as steel, for six to twelve
months by entering into forward purchase contracts, we also entered into short-, medium-, and longterm price and supply agreements to mitigate the risk of rising energy prices arising on energy
purchases for our own use, because this risk increased in 2022 as compared to prior years. However,
there can be no assurance that energy price and supply agreements will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms or that it will be sufficient to address the increased levels of volatility.
In addition, early termination of energy price and supply agreements may trigger significant
termination fees, all of which may make the use of derivative financial instruments economically
unattractive, thereby exposing us to the risks of fluctuations in raw material prices. In addition, there
can be no assurance that our energy price and supply agreements, which themselves represent a
cost, will be adequate to cover the additional costs generated by potential future increases in energy
prices. Although energy price and supply agreements can offer protection against energy price
fluctuations for a limited period of time, they do not lessen the long-term effects of structural
worldwide energy price increases. Changes in the fair values of financial instruments we use to
mitigate the risk of rising energy prices, which depends on future market prices for electricity and
available electricity amounts and can be very volatile, can also have a significant negative impact on
our operating results.

Furthermore, increases in raw materials and energy prices could only be partially passed on to
customers during 2022, which adversely affected margins in 2022 and could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations. Pricing dynamics differ among our Divisions and businesses, price
recovery is partial in most cases, and may at times be delayed. It is particularly difficult to pass price
increases onto the customers of our Automotive Technologies Division; direct negotiation with each
customer is necessary to change the terms of our customer contracts and the business is facing
considerable pricing pressure, driven by increasing customer demands for price reductions,
purchasing cooperatives, and certain focused and leaner competitors, especially in growth markets.
Even to the extent that we are successful in compensating for or passing on our increased costs to
our customers by increasing prices, the positive effects of such price increases may not occur in the


-----

periods in which the additional expenses have been incurred, but in later periods. In that event, the
price increases will not have a compensating effect for the periods in which the costs increased. If
costs of raw materials and energy continue to rise, and if we are not able to undertake cost-saving
measures elsewhere in our operations or increase the selling prices of our products, we will not be
able to compensate for such cost increases.

During periods of declining raw material or energy prices, customers may demand price reductions
for our products, despite the fact that we may be using existing inventories that were purchased at
higher prices. This could in turn have a negative effect on our profit margins, particularly if we enter
into forward purchase contracts with respect to such raw materials and, as a consequence, lower
market prices are reflected in our inventories on a delayed basis.

Any events leading to fluctuations in prices or scarcity of raw materials, energy and increased freight
and logistics costs could disrupt our operations, or could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with market trends and technological developments, including_**
**_trends toward electric mobility and digitalization, and we may not be able to adapt sufficiently or_**
**_in a timely manner._**

Our future success depends on our ability to recognize market trends and technological changes and
to develop and bring to the market new and improved products in a timely manner. The markets for
the products offered by us are subject to significant technological change, continuously developing
technological standards, changing customer preferences, constantly emerging innovative products
and increasing numbers of new market entrants, particularly in the fields of electric mobility and
autonomous driving. The political and societal drive towards action against climate change and
increasing environmental regulation are key drivers for changes in customer demand and consumer
behavior. The automotive market, in particular, is characterized by progressive development towards
higher performance and simultaneously more fuel-efficient, less polluting and quieter engines,
electronic control and assistance systems, autonomous driving, connectivity, as well as towards
medium range cars and hybrid and electric vehicles. The emergence of hybrid, electric and hydrogen
powertrains represents a fundamental change to established vehicle technology. Existing
technologies and products may be entirely replaced by newly developed and marketed technologies
and newly introduced products, putting further development of the conventional powertrain under
pressure.

Trends in automotive technology such as electrification and the increase in automated transmissions
are expected to have an impact on our future product portfolio. As electrification of automobiles is
progressing, the further development of conventional powertrains has come under pressure, driven
in particular by increasing regulatory constraints related to CO2 emissions. For example, EU
Regulation 2019/631 provides for stricter CO2 emissions targets, which require EU fleet-wide CO2
emissions from passenger cars to be 37.5% lower than the 2021 level beginning in 2030. In February
2023, the EU Parliament adopted the EU Commission’s July 14, 2021 proposal to amend Regulation
2019/631, which aims to accelerate the transition to low- and zero emission vehicles by requiring
average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to be reduced by 55% by
2023 and 100% by 2035, each as compared to 2021 levels. This would mean that all new vehicles
registered on or after January 1, 2035 would be required to have zero CO2 emissions. In addition, on
February 14, 2022, the EU Commission proposed amending Regulation 2019/1242 to strengthen CO2
emission performance standards for new heavy duty vehicles by requiring average CO2 emissions of
most new heavy duty vehicles to be reduced by 45% by 2030, 65% by 2035 and 90% by 2040, each as
compared to 2019 levels, as well as requiring that all new city buses have zero CO2 emissions as of
2030. See also “—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We could become subject to additional
_burdensome environmental, safety or other regulations and additional regulation could adversely_
_affect demand for our products and services.” We need to have a competitive cost structure in order_


-----

to further accelerate the transformation process and ensure that we are fully geared for powertrain
electrification and that, in turn, requires us to reduce our cost base and production overcapacity for
conventional powertrains. Improvements to conventional powertrains may become less relevant and
existing products and applications may be replaced. If alternative powertrains, such as electric
vehicles, were to gain further market share sooner than currently expected, such new powertrains
may not require our products or may make use of our products to a lesser extent than conventional
powertrains, which could result in us losing market share and result in us initiating additional cost
saving measures.

Digitalization is progressing rapidly and has already completely transformed certain sectors. The pace
of implementation and adaptation represents an important success factor in this regard and,
therefore, also a risk. For example, in the wind sector, technological developments in wind power
gear boxes could lead to an increasing shift away from conventional rolling bearing solutions and
result in a decrease in demand for our products.

Should we fail to develop appropriate strategies as a response to the market trends described above
or similar market trends, growth opportunities could be lost or we could lose existing customers.

There can be no assurance that (i) we will be successful in developing new products or systems or in
bringing them to market in a timely manner, or at all, (ii) products or technologies developed by
others will not render our offerings obsolete or non-competitive, (iii) our customers will not
substitute our products with competing products or alternate technology, (iv) the market will accept
our innovations, (v) our competitors will not be able to produce our non-patented products more
cheaply, or (vi) we will be able to adjust our cost structure in the event of contraction of demand.

Should we fail to develop appropriate strategies as a response to these or other market trends and to
enhance existing products, develop new products or keep pace with developing market trends or
technology, growth opportunities could be lost or we could lose existing customers.

If we devote resources to the pursuit of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the
marketplace or that fail to be commercially viable, all or part of these research and development
(“R&D”) expenses may be lost and our business may suffer. Our revenues from business related to
electromobility, in particular, are heavily concentrated on individual customer projects and, as a
result, are more dependent on the market success of those customer projects. As no standards have
been established for electric mobility to date, our customers continue to develop a variety of
technological solutions and we devote resources to develop novel solutions and products specific to
those technological solutions. If one or more of those technological solutions fail to be accepted in
the marketplace or fail to be commercially viable, or if a customer project is stopped before the
anticipated end of the project, or after volume production commenced or realized volumes are lower
than originally anticipated, it may result in the impairment of assets before they are fully amortized
and our business may suffer. In addition, the development and range of assistance systems up to
fully automated vehicles and the introduction of so-called “people movers” are accelerating. If the
realization does not correspond to the assumed development, this can impact our financial, asset
and earnings situation. The assumptions of this development are subject to an ongoing strategic
review. See also “—We may not be able to obtain the funding required for our R&D activities and
_these activities may not lead to the development of commercially successful products.”_

In addition, we currently rely on a high degree of vertical integration and comprehensive production
expertise to facilitate improvements in the production process and ultimately safeguard our ability to
maintain our margins. The evolution of our business from being component-driven toward being
more systems-based is ongoing, and, because these systems may employ a greater proportion of
components not manufactured by us, but purchased from other suppliers, this change could reduce
the proportion of value added by us.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_The imposition of tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers on automobiles and other goods could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on us._**

Beginning in 2018, the United States announced a series of potential measures relating to
international trade, which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse impact on
the global economy, international trade or the automotive industry. In January 2018, the U.S. began
to impose tariffs on certain products, which were later expanded to include a 25% tariff on imports of
steel, a 10% tariff on imports of aluminum in June 2018, and then to products containing a high
proportion of these metals, such as nails, cables, and certain automotive parts in January 2020. In
2021, the United States reached agreements with the EU and Japan to eliminate or lower these
tariffs, but they remain in effect for other countries (including, for example, China). The U.S. also
negotiated a replacement of the North American Free Trade Agreement in October 2018. On July 1,
2020, the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement entered into force, and includes more
stringent rule of origin provisions requiring automobiles to have 75% of their components
manufactured in Mexico, the U.S., or Canada to qualify for zero tariffs (previously 62.5%) and
requiring a minimum percentage of manufacturing to be produced with labor earning above a certain
minimum wage. We have operations in Mexico and Canada and the imposition of additional import
restrictions, non-tariff trade barriers or tariffs could adversely affect our ability to supply customers
in the U.S. In addition, new import restrictions, non-tariff trade barriers and/or tariffs could result in
higher prices for light duty and heavy duty vehicles, which could in turn have a negative impact on
the demand for our products. In addition, our results of operations could also be affected by
retaliatory measures from Europe, China or other countries imposing tariffs on the U.S.

In February 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce determined the import of automobiles,
uranium, and titanium sponge threaten to impair national security, but has not imposed tariffs or
quotas on those imports to date. This could however result in the imposition of additional duties on
imports of vehicles into the U.S. in the future. Such import tariffs, if imposed, could have a material
adverse effect on the demand for non-U.S. light duty vehicles in the U.S. Through our European
operations, we, directly and indirectly, supply a number of original equipment manufacturers
(“OEM”) that currently export a large number of light duty vehicles into the U.S. market. A significant
decrease in demand for these cars in the U.S. market would therefore materially and adversely affect
demand for our products. Any such decrease in demand could have a material and adverse effect on
our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, which could in turn
adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes or cause the market price of the
Notes to decline.

Higher tariffs or the imposition of new tariffs, could materially and adversely affect complex supply
chains in the automotive industry. The automotive industry supply chain has developed over decades
and relies on existing trade arrangements to provide for cross-border supplies of raw materials,
automotive parts and other components. The impact of terminating existing trade arrangements
could be materially disruptive to the supply chains resulting in immediate shortages of critical parts
and components necessary to manufacture automobiles and other vehicles. This could have a
material adverse effect on the automotive industry as a whole and our business in particular.

**_We operate in industries that are cyclical and affected by numerous trends and developments,_**
**_which makes it hard to correctly forecast demand for our products._**

As a global automotive and industrial supplier, the demand for our products is largely determined by
the global economic environment. Demand for our products depends to a significant extent on
overall economic developments. In addition, demand is subject to cyclical fluctuations.


-----

Our business is very capital intensive and characterized by high fixed costs. On the one hand, we risk
underutilization of our facilities if the markets in which we operate decline, which has occurred most
recently in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the course of the war in Ukraine.
Underutilization of our facilities could result in idle capacity costs, write-offs of inventories, losses on
products due to falling average sale prices. Furthermore, falling production volumes cause declines in
revenues and earnings.

On the other hand, we risk having insufficient capacity to meet customer demand if the markets in
which we operate grow faster than anticipated and thus may lose market share. Fluctuations in
demand also make it difficult for us to predict our working capital requirements, which could
adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity. Regional shifts in demand could also require us to
relocate production facilities, which could result in disruptions in production, higher cost or capital
expenditure requirements, or require us to record impairment charges.

Sales of our Automotive Technologies Division, which accounted for 60.1% of our consolidated
revenue in 2022, are cyclical and depend, among other things, on global vehicle production volumes,
general economic conditions, such as supply chain stability and freight and logistics costs, and
consumer spending and preferences, which can be affected by a number of factors, including
employment, consumer confidence and income, energy costs and fuel prices, interest rate levels,
inflation and the availability of consumer financing. Given the variety of such economic parameters
influencing the global automotive demand, the volume of automotive production has historically
been, and will continue to be, characterized by a high level of fluctuation, making it difficult for us to
accurately predict demand levels for our products aimed at the automotive sector. Demand for
automotive products can also be affected by various other factors. For example, the global
semiconductor shortage significantly impaired automobile production, particularly in the second half
of 2021 and in 2022, which has also had a significant negative impact on demand for our products.
The war in Ukraine could also further negatively impact the supply of certain critical materials and
metals, such as neon gas and palladium, which are used in semiconductor manufacturing and for
which a significant portion of global production comes from Russia and, in the case of neon gas,
Ukraine, and platinum and other metals used in automobile production, which could again impair
automobile production and have a significant impact on demand for our products. In addition,
purchase incentives and the expansion of the charging infrastructure can contribute to increased
demand for products for hybrid and electric powertrains, which may contain a smaller percentage of
our products, thereby significantly impacting demand for our products. Demand for our automotive
products can also be affected by regulatory developments or investigations affecting our customers.
For example, in recent years, authorities in the United States and Europe determined that certain
OEMs intentionally programmed automobiles with diesel engines to restrict emissions during testing
to pass applicable requirements. A number of OEMs have been subject to negative press coverage
and/or criminal investigations and/or civil actions in multiple jurisdictions, in some cases leading to
product recalls and substantial fines. In response, regulators in California have implemented new
testing and inspection regulations for diesel vehicles which will take full effect in 2024. Other U.S.
regulators have indicated more stringent testing standards for diesel vehicles may be developed as
well, alongside increased emissions standards for diesel vehicles already imposed by California and
other states. See “—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We could become subject to additional
_burdensome environmental, safety or other regulations and additional regulation could adversely_
_affect demand for our products and services.” Additionally, certain groups and initiatives have_
announced voluntary or local-level restrictions on the use of diesel vehicles, even if they are
compliant with applicable standards, including the mayors of Paris, Mexico City, London, Madrid and
Athens. In China, limited access to vehicle registration is used to slow the increase in traffic and
related pollution. If, as a result of these investigations, actions and increased scrutiny regarding diesel
vehicles, our significant OEM customers curtail, or discontinue, their production of diesel vehicles
that incorporate our products, the sales of our Automotive Technologies Division could be adversely
affected.


-----

In addition, OEM customers generally do not commit to purchasing minimum quantities from their
suppliers. Inability to correctly forecast demand for our automotive products could lead to
underutilization of our facilities or insufficient capacity to meet customer demand. Attempts to react
to such inaccurate forecasts by increasing or reducing our capacity at short notice may cause us to
incur additional costs (e.g., severance payments or overtime surcharges).

Sales of our Automotive Aftermarket Division, which accounted for 12.9% of our consolidated
revenue in 2022, depend, among other things, on general economic conditions as well as on
consumer spending and preferences, available innovations in products and technologies, on
complexity, growth and average age of global vehicle population as well as on average usage and
lifetime of parts before a replacement is required. Inability to correctly forecast demand for our
aftermarket products could lead to underutilization of our facilities or insufficient capacity to meet
customer demand.

Sales of our Industrial Division, which accounted for 27.0% of our consolidated revenue in 2022,
depend on the development of global industrial production, especially in the mechanical engineering,
transportation means and electrical equipment sectors. Due to the high diversification within the
Division, various factors, such as fiscal policies, infrastructure programs or consumer behavior and
customer loyalty in general, in certain countries or in certain industry sectors, influence demand for
our products. The variety of factors makes it difficult for us to estimate requirements for production
capacity and to reliably forecast future working capital requirements. Inability to correctly forecast
demand for our industrial products could lead to underutilization of our facilities or insufficient
capacity to meet customer demand.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our business environment is characterized by intense competition, which could reduce our revenues_**
**_or put continued pressure on our sales prices._**

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, technologically fast-paced and have been
characterized by changes in market penetration, increased price competition as well as the
development and introduction of new products, product designs and technologies by significant
existing and new competitors. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality, timeliness of
delivery and design as well as the ability to provide engineering support, repair know-how and
service on a global basis. Some OEMs have begun to reduce the number of vendors in their supply
base in an effort to simplify their value chain and focus on their relationships with a limited number
of vendors. Should we fail to secure the quality of our products and the reliability of our supply and
service in the future, our customers could decide to procure products from our competitors, which
could lead to a loss in our market share.

The automotive supply industry has been characterized by significant investments, rapid
technological change, for example, in electric mobility and autonomous driving, particularly in the
Greater China region, continuous advancements in process technologies and manufacturing facilities,
intense pricing pressure from major OEM customers and periods of oversupply. In addition, new
customers could enter the market with whom we do not have any existing or extensive customer
relationship and the market share of automobile manufactures that do not use or that use a below
average amount of our products per vehicle could increase. We compete with other international
suppliers and, to a lesser extent, regional companies and new market entrant suppliers, particularly
in the fields of electric mobility and autonomous driving. The end customers for our products are
increasingly affected by innovation and cost-cutting pressures from competitors and seek price
reductions in both the initial bidding process and during the term, or upon expiration, of an existing
contract. In particular, vehicle manufacturers expect lower prices from suppliers for the same, and in
some cases even enhanced functionality, as well as a consistently high product quality. We may not


-----

be able to pass some or all of these demands for extensive price reductions on to our own suppliers.
If we are unable to offset price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and the
realization of synergies, price reductions could impact our profit margins.

Our industrial business is also increasingly faced with competitors from growth economies that are
exerting pressure on market prices, considerably so in some cases. In certain industries, customers
increasingly prefer standardized products over customer-specific developments, and this trend
benefits competitors from growth economies as well, which could lead to a loss in our market share.
In addition, some of the industries and markets in which we are active, particularly the Automotive
Aftermarket business, are characterized by consolidation among competitors. Any future
consolidation among our competitors could allow them to benefit from economies of scale, offer
more comprehensive product portfolios, and increase the size of their serviceable markets. This
could require us to accept reductions in our profit margins and the loss of market share due to price
pressure.

Our profit margins have decreased in recent years as a result of our expanded systems business,
which tends to have lower profit margins because the systems we produce include a number of parts
that we purchase from other suppliers, and also because of lower profitability in the component
business, which may continue in the future because of price pressure by customers and overcapacity
at suppliers.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We depend on a limited number of large OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers for the sale of a substantial_**
**_portion of our products and adverse developments relating to these customers could also adversely_**
**_affect our own business._**

In 2022, we generated revenue of €1,377 million from one key customer, representing 8.7% of our
total revenue and 14.0% of the revenue of the Automotive Technologies Division. In the Automotive
Technologies Division, the ten largest customers accounted for approximately 64.8% of the Division’s
total revenue in 2022. Many of our customers are large OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers (i.e., suppliers that
sell their products directly to OEMs). A number of factors, including loss of market share by these
customers, termination of supply agreements and/or the failure to renegotiate new agreements or
new terms, loss of contracts, reduced or delayed customer requirements, bankruptcy or insolvency
of a customer, plant shutdowns, strikes or other work stoppages, and changed regulatory
requirements, affecting production by such customers could cause a loss of all or a substantial
portion of sales to any of our major customers. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused
decreases in consumer demand, extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and
those of our customers and suppliers, and delays and disruptions in vehicle production schedules,
and other adverse global economic impacts and adversely impacted and may continue to adversely
impact our customers’ and our business and operations. In addition, as a result of the war in Ukraine,
some of our customers have ceased operations and sales in Russia and more of our customers may
also cease operations and sales in Russia or other countries that provide military or material support
to Russia, which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact vehicle production
and demand for our products. Furthermore, any reputational damage incurred by such customers
(e.g., due to compliance violations, product defects) could also damage our reputation, even if the
actual facts and parts in question are completely unrelated to us.

Furthermore, our customers may consolidate or merge from time to time. Consolidation among our
customers could result in an increasingly concentrated client base of large customers which could,
among others, increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers. In the course of a
merger or proposed merger, disclosure and sharing of pricing information and consolidation of
purchasing volumes provides transparency regarding pricing and cost structures, and could lead to


-----

increased pricing pressure. Mergers of our customers with entities that are not our customers could
also materially impact our financial position and results of operations if the resulting entity is no
longer our customer. For example, in 2021, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Peugeot S.A. merged to
form Stellantis N.V. and we are currently negotiating a new relationship with Stellantis N.V., which
could result in contractual terms less favorable to us than our prior separate contracts with Fiat
Chrysler Automobiles and Peugeot S.A.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_The significant bargaining power of our major customers may adversely affect our profit margins._**

Our major customers have substantial bargaining power with respect to price and other commercial
terms. Most OEM customers, for example, have recurring price-reduction initiatives and objectives
with their suppliers. Our customers’ demand for price reductions drives us to constantly improve our
production process in order to reduce costs. If we are not successful in these improvements, our
profit margins may be adversely affected. In addition, if any of our major customers discontinue their
business relationship with us or terminate a supply contract prematurely, the original investments
made by us to provide products to this customer could be wholly or partially lost.

The timing and amount of sales to our major customers ultimately depend on factors that are beyond
our control (such as, sales levels and shipping schedules for the customer products into which our
products are incorporated). We cannot be certain that our customers will continue to manufacture
products that incorporate our products at current levels or at all. Failure of our customers to achieve
significant sales of products incorporating our products and fluctuations in the timing and volume of
such product sales could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, failure by these customers to
inform us of changes to their production needs in a timely manner could also impede our ability to
effectively manage our business. The effect on our business would be particularly acute if a number
of customer relationships were terminated or the number of products we deliver under such
relationships were substantially reduced within a short period of time.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We could be adversely affected by our customers defaulting on payments._**

In addition to the impact that production cuts and permanent capacity reductions by OEM customers
may have on our business and results of operations, the financial condition of these customers can
also affect our own financial condition. In the past, OEM customers and other customers have
suffered from declines in sales and production, tightened liquidity and increased cost of capital,
which, together with structural issues specific to these companies (such as significant overcapacity
and pension and healthcare costs), have caused many of these companies to undergo unprecedented
restructurings, including reorganizations under bankruptcy laws.

If the creditworthiness of our OEM customers or other customers were to decline, we would face an
increased default risk with respect to our trade receivables. There can be no assurance that any
financial arrangements provided to these companies, or even a successful reorganization of such
companies through bankruptcy, will guarantee their continued viability. Such risks are insured at
levels considered economically reasonable and on standard market terms by us, but we do not carry
insurance on all of our receivables and our insurance coverage could prove insufficient. If certain of
our OEM customers are unable to make payments for products that we have already delivered, we
may not be able to recover those receivables. In addition, if any of our customers becomes insolvent,
the original investments made by us to provide products to this customer could be wholly or partially
lost. This customer default risk has increased due to COVID-19 and trade restrictions.


-----

Payment defaults by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Longer product lives of OEM parts could adversely affect aftermarket demand for some of our_**
**_products._**

The average useful life of parts, particularly in the end products of OEMs, has increased in recent
years due to innovations in products and technologies. Longer product lives generally lead to lessfrequent replacement of parts over the lifespan of the equipment, leading in turn to decreased
aftermarket sales of the relevant products. This dynamic has adversely affected our aftermarket sales
in the past and could do so in the future. Further increases in average useful lives of parts could also
further adversely affect aftermarket demand for certain of our products.

Lower demand for our products due to longer product lives of OEM parts could have a material
adverse effect on our aftermarket revenue and, accordingly, our business, net assets, financial
condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Climate change and related regulatory responses may adversely impact our business._**

There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased
concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes
in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural
disasters. Changes in weather patterns, including prolonged droughts, and an increased frequency,
intensity and duration of extreme weather conditions could, among other things, disrupt the
operation of our production sites and supply chain, increase our product costs and impact demand
for our products. For example, water is an essential component of our production operations.
Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water (including limitations
from natural causes such as drought) could impact our operations and could require us to make
significant investments or move to different locations. In certain areas with higher water risks, we
may be required to make significant investments to reduce the use of fresh water in our operations
or to implement technologies for water treatment or rainwater capture. As a result, the effects of
climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

In many of the countries in which we operate, governmental bodies are increasingly enacting
legislation and regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change as well as specific
levies related directly to energy consumption (such as taxes on CO2 emissions), which are expected to
increase in the future. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact our operations
directly or indirectly as a result of any required compliance by us, as well as by our suppliers,
wholesale partners and distributors. In addition, our manufacturing processes have been and may be
affected by new regulations in response to climate change. If we are perceived to be a significant
contributor of greenhouse gas emissions or global warming, or if we are perceived as not taking
appropriate steps to mitigate our effect on the environment, this could result in damage to our
reputation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

In addition, we have and expect to continue to take voluntary steps to mitigate our impact on climate
change. As a result, we may experience increases in energy, production, transportation and raw
material costs, capital expenditures or insurance premiums and deductibles. See “Business—
_Environment, Social and Governance.”_

**_We may not be able to benefit from our expansion in growth markets._**

We have dedicated significant resources to enhance our local presence in growth markets and we
intend to continue to pursue this growth strategy, particularly in the Greater China, Asia/Pacific and
Americas regions. However, should we be unable to secure sufficient funding to finance our
development and growth activities in the future, we could lose our competitive position in these
important and rapidly growing regional markets. Furthermore, if we invest in growth markets that do
not develop as expected, or that deteriorate due to economic, political or other reasons, all or part of
these investments may be lost. We also depend on the success of our customers in the growth
markets.

In addition, the success of our investments in growth markets will depend on attracting and retaining
qualified personnel (including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees),
maintaining our high-quality standards and implementing our standardized process and quality
management globally.

If we fail to recoup our investments in growth markets, this could have a material adverse effect on
our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our business in growth markets is subject to a variety of business, economic, legal and political_**
**_risks, the materialization of which could adversely affect our business._**

We manufacture our products in many countries and market and sell them worldwide. We are
actively operating and may continue to expand our operations in rapidly growing and developing
markets, including China, India and Vietnam. Potential social, political, legal and economic instability,
such as that caused by the war in Ukraine, may pose significant risks to our ability to conduct our
business and expand our activities in certain markets. Inherent in our international operations is the
risk that any number of the following circumstances could adversely affect our operations:

  - underdeveloped infrastructure;

  - lack of qualified management or adequately trained personnel;

  - divergent labor regulations or cultural expectations regarding employment;

  - currency exchange controls, exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations;

  - changes in local economic conditions;

  - governmental restrictions on foreign investment, transfer or repatriation of funds;

  - protectionist trade measures, such as anti-dumping measures, duties, tariffs or embargoes;

  - prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;

  - changes in laws or regulations and unpredictable or unlawful government actions;

  - the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;

  - variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;

  - business environments in which fraud, bribery or corruption are common, condoned or
encouraged by private or official actors;

  - potential nationalization of enterprises or other expropriations;

  - political or social unrest or acts of sabotage or terrorism; and

  - international sanctions or boycott measures.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to successfully integrate or achieve expected benefits from recent or future_**
**_acquisitions or investments and may be subject to risks relating to joint ventures or other_**
**_arrangements where we do not exercise full control and we may be exposed to risks in connection_**
**_with dispositions._**

We have pursued and may in the future pursue selected acquisitions, such as the acquisitions of
Ewellix AB and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Ewellix” or the “Ewellix Group”), SPV Solarpark 106.
GmbH & Co. KG (“SPV Solarpark”), CERASPIN S.à r.l. (“CERASPIN”), Schaeffler ByWire Technologie
GmbH & Co. KG (“Schaeffler ByWire”), Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives GmbH (“Schaeffler Ultra
**Precision Drives”) and Bega international B.V. (“Bega”), and investments in joint ventures and other**
arrangements where we do not exercise full control, such as our recently established joint ventures
Cofinity-X GmbH (“Cofinity-X”) and Innoplate SAS (“Innoplate”). To the extent that we are successful
in making acquisitions or investments, we may need to expend substantial amounts of cash, incur
additional debt or assume loss-making divisions. Acquisitions, investments and joint ventures also
involve a number of other risks, including:

  - overestimation of the target value;

  - unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired operations;

  - extraordinary or unexpected legal, regulatory, contractual or other costs;

  - difficulties in integrating the employees and financial, technological and management
standards, processes, procedures and controls of the acquired business with those of our
existing operations;

  - unexpected or higher than expected costs related to the integration of an acquired business;

  - challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our
operations;

  - mitigating contingent and/or assumed liabilities;

  - the possible loss of customers and/or suppliers;

  - control issues in relation to investments in joint ventures and other arrangements where we
do not exercise full control;

  - possibility that partners or co-investors may become bankrupt, fail to fund their required
capital contributions or perform their obligations poorly or not at all;

  - possibility that co-investors have objectives that are inconsistent or that conflict with our
business interests or goals and may be in a position to block or impede action with respect to
our investments or take actions contrary to our policies, objectives or interests;

  - disputes may arise between us and our co-investors that may consume significant financial and
other resources and result in the loss of business opportunities and growth; and

  - actions by our co-investors, of which we may be unaware, or which we may be unable to
control, such as political affiliations, illegal or corrupt practices and other activities, may cause
reputational damage to us or result in adverse consequences to our investments.

We may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies, future earnings or other
benefits that we intend to achieve from acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that any recent or future
acquisition will yield benefits that are sufficient to justify the expenses we incurred or will incur. We
could also take on additional risks as a result of acquisitions.

In addition, following acquisitions, we record goodwill and other intangible assets on our
consolidated financial statements that will be subject to impairment based upon future adverse
changes in our business or prospects. With regards to intangible assets in particular, the net carrying


-----

amounts on our balance sheet are significant. As of December 31, 2022, the intangible assets on our
balance sheet totaled €916 million, including €540 million in goodwill. In addition, the Ewellix
Acquisition is expected to result in significant additional goodwill impact. “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Key Factors_
_affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions.”_

Pursuant to current accounting rules, we are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least
annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Impairment indicators include, but
are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating
results, a significant decline in share price or market capitalization and negative industry or economic
trends. If such events were to occur, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, the
carrying amount of our goodwill may no longer be recoverable and we would be required to record
an impairment charge. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Results of Operations—Revenue”_
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the
_Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Results of Operations—Acquisitions.” The impairment of any_
goodwill and other intangible assets could result in material non-cash charges and may have a
negative impact on our results of operations in the future.

In the past, we have disposed of certain businesses or operations that we no longer considered core
strategic activities or that were not sufficiently profitable, such as the disposition of our global drive
train business and the planned disposal of our two Russian subsidiaries, and we may make such
disposals in the future. Such disposals expose us to various risks. For example, we could be subject to
liability resulting from breaches of representations and warranties, or under indemnities, that we
provide to purchasers in connection with those disposals or we could continue to be liable, jointly
with the purchaser, for certain obligations of the disposed businesses that arose prior to the disposal,
such as retirement or pension obligations.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We depend on a limited number of key suppliers for certain products and inability to source_**
**_products from these suppliers, particularly due to supply interruptions, could adversely affect our_**
**_operations._**

We require substantial amounts of raw materials for our production, in particular various types of
steel and other alloys, aluminum, zinc, copper and other non-ferrous metals as well as plastics and
lubricants and electric power. For some of the critical components used as part of our production and
manufacturing processes we rely on a limited number of key suppliers. Accordingly, our procurement
logistics may be adversely affected by supply delays, cancellations, strikes, insufficient quantities or
inadequate quality related to any of our suppliers. These could be the result of a general lack of
production capacity for certain raw materials or components, or of shortages or other external
factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts (such as the war in Ukraine), or climatic events,
delays or disruptions in shipping due to port congestion, port closures, vessel delays or extraordinary
accidents (such as the Suez Canal closure in March 2021), as well as by global economic recoveries,
such as the recent recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, that have created and may
continue to create pressure on demand for such raw materials or components. In the course of the
first quarter of 2022, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine saw price surges in almost all of the
commodity and energy markets that are important to us. As a result, production further down the
global value chain can be disrupted. The ability to deliver is a decisive competitive factor for a longterm, trusting customer relationship. This is constantly being increased by systematically improving
production and sales logistics. Any of these factors could result in interruptions in production and,
therefore, have an adverse effect on our production capacity and lead to under-utilization of our
production sites, which in turn may cause delays in the delivery of products to our customers. If any


-----

one of our suppliers becomes unable to meet our delivery requirements for any reason (e.g., due to
insolvency, destruction of production plants, strikes or refusal to perform following a change in
control), we may be unable to source input products from other suppliers upon short notice and/or
at the required volume.

In addition, many of our OEM customers have approval rights with respect to the suppliers used by
us, limiting our ability to source input products from other suppliers upon short notice if the relevant
OEM customer has not already approved such other suppliers.

Inability to source the required quantities of raw materials and components when needed could have
a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations. See also “—Prices of many of our raw materials and energy have increased significantly
_and may rise further, which may lead to higher production and manufacturing.”_

**_The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, results_**
**_of operations and cash flows._**

Although the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic may have passed, any possible future outbreaks or
recurrences, or actual or perceived occurrences of epidemics or pandemics, could have an adverse
effect on us. The global spread of COVID-19 and its variants created significant macroeconomic
uncertainty, volatility and disruption including declining economic growth, numerous business
insolvencies, and significantly increased unemployment, resulting in decreased per capita income and
disposable income. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect our
operations. This could include, but is not limited to, decreases in consumer demand, extended work
stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers, delays or
disruptions in vehicle production schedules, postponement or cancellation of our capital expenditure
projects and other adverse global economic impacts. In addition, some continued local lockdowns,
such as in China, may continue to affect operations.

Notably, the supply shortages created by the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an impact
on our suppliers and customers. See “—We depend on a limited number of key suppliers for certain
_products and inability to source products from these suppliers, particularly due to supply_
_interruptions, could adversely affect our operations” and “—Prices of many of our raw materials and_
_energy have increased significantly and may rise further, which may lead to higher production and_
_manufacturing costs,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Results of Operations—Operating_
_Expenses—Raw Material and Energy Costs.”_

Moreover, any impacts on our business operations as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
could also affect our financial condition. For example, while we did not recognize any impairment
loss in 2022, we recognized an impairment charge in relation to goodwill allocated to the Automotive
Technologies Division in the amount of €249 million in 2020 because the COVID-19 pandemic led to
increased uncertainty and, therefore, to changes in the assumptions used to determine the
recoverable amount of groups of cash-generating units. See also “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Key Factors_
_affecting Results of Operations—Revenue” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Results of_
_Operations—Acquisitions.”_

The course and effects of the coronavirus pandemic are continuously analyzed in order to ensure our
earning power and liquidity position are meeting targeted measures. However, any of the foregoing
could still materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.


-----

**_Our future business success depends on our ability to maintain the high quality of our products and_**
**_the punctual delivery of ordered goods._**

For customers, one of the determining factors in purchasing our components and systems is the high
quality of our products, in particular due to their often mission-critical nature. A decrease in the
actual and perceived quality of our products could damage our image and reputation and also the
image and reputation of one or more of our brands. In addition, defective products could result in
loss of sales, loss of customers and loss of market acceptance. Furthermore, our customers could
potentially bring claims for damages, even if the cause of the defect is remedied at a later point in
time.

We manufacture many products pursuant to specifications and quality requirements of our OEM
customers. If the products manufactured and delivered by us do not meet the requirements
stipulated by our OEM customers at the agreed date of delivery, production of the relevant products
is generally discontinued until the cause of the product defect has been identified and remedied.
The above risks also apply in cases where we utilize or rely on third parties in our production
processes and operations. For example, we experienced delivery delays and certain quality issues in
the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s assembly and packaging center in Halle, Germany (the
“AKO”), as a result of the actions of its former third-party operator. These delivery delays and quality
issues have resulted in customer claims and the loss of a number of customers, which has adversely
affected the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenues. We terminated the former third-party
operator’s contract and a new third-party operator took over operation of the AKO on August 1,
2022, but may still face further claims from customers affected by delivery delays or quality issues or
the loss of additional customers or revenue. While we were able to reach a settlement for damages
with the former third-party operator, we were not able to recover the full amount of our losses and
there can be no assurance that we will not face further claims in the future as a result of the actions
of the current or any future third-party operator.

In addition, delivery capabilities and delivery performance represent a key competitive factor.
Disruptions to local, regional domestic, or international transportation services for our products due
to shortages in vessels, barges, railcars or trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, droughts,
accidents, mechanical difficulties, bankruptcies, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, trade restrictions,
pandemics, or other events may impair our ability to deliver products to customers on time or at all,
and might permit our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products, result in
contractual penalties, expose us to damage claims from our customers, result in a loss of customers
or negatively impact our reputation.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Product piracy may adversely affect our operations._**

We aim to maintain a high quality standard for our products and believe that our brands enjoy a
reputation of high performance and reliability. A resulting side effect is that we have been the target
of product piracy in the past, covering nearly the entire product portfolio of our Automotive
Technologies and Industrial Divisions’ product catalogs. In the last few years, there have been cases
of counterfeit bearings being delivered, for example, to public transportation companies, for marine
applications and to the energy industry for installation in offshore wind turbines.

Due to the reputation of our brands, we expect that third parties will continue to produce and
distribute counterfeit products under our brands in the future. Such products are usually sold at
significantly reduced prices or produced with significantly shorter lead times as the production
standards and steel quality are inferior to our standards, which might put pressure on us to lower the
prices we charge for original products. We may also lose market share to producers of counterfeit
products, particularly in growth markets. While we actively prosecute product piracy in all of our


-----

markets, fighting product piracy may be costly and prove unsuccessful. Furthermore, the lower
quality standards of counterfeit products illegally sold under our brand names may damage our
brand image if customers unwittingly purchase such products and experience product failures or
poor performance. It could also result in us facing product liability claims and having to pay damages
for the failure of counterfeit products.

Product piracy could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial
condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to obtain the funding required for our R&D activities and these activities may_**
**_not lead to the development of commercially successful products._**

Developing new and improved products requires a substantial amount of capital funding. If we
devote resources to the pursuit of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the
marketplace or that fail to become commercially viable, all or part of these R&D expenses may be
lost. Furthermore, should we be unable to secure sufficient funding to finance our R&D activities, we
could lose our competitive position in a number of important and rapidly growing sub-markets.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our operations depend on qualified executives and key employees and the loss of these persons_**
**_could adversely affect our market position and prospects._**

Our success depends on the members of the Board of Managing Directors, and other qualified
executives and employees in key functions throughout Schaeffler Group. The loss of executives or
key employees could have a material adverse effect on our market position and prospects.
Considerable expertise could be lost or access thereto gained by competitors. Due to intense
competition within the industry, there is a risk of losing qualified employees to competitors or being
unable to find a sufficient number of appropriate new employees. There is no guarantee that we will
be successful in retaining our executives and the employees in key positions or in attracting new
employees with corresponding qualifications.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our business could be adversely impacted by strikes and other labor disputes._**

With approximately 83,000 employees (as of December 31, 2022), we employ a large workforce
around the world. A significant number of our employees, particularly in Germany, are unionized.
Furthermore, Schaeffler AG and other German entities of Schaeffler Group are subject to the
regulations of the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz). Therefore, we depend on
positive relationships with our employees and employee representatives. These relationships could
deteriorate in the future and we could experience additional strikes, further unionization efforts or
other types of conflicts with employee representatives or our employees. From 2019 through 2022,
we reduced our workforce significantly (from 92,478 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 82,773
employees as of December 31, 2022), mostly in Germany and the rest of Europe and mainly in
connection with our efficiency and portfolio optimization subprograms and other structural
measures aimed at increasing efficiency. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic we implemented
various measures, such as short-time work (Kurzarbeit), closure days, using hours in flextime
accounts, workforce reductions, plant closures, and plant holidays. In November 2022, we initiated
further restructuring measures, which will include reducing our headcount by 1,300 positions
worldwide and, within Germany, will mainly impact the Herzogenaurach, Buehl and Homburg
locations. In addition, we are developing strategies for the Ingolstadt and Morbach locations in
consultation with employee representatives for those locations. See “—We may be unable to
_implement our efficiency and portfolio optimization and growth programs successfully.” More_


-----

headcount reductions may be implemented in the future. Though we intend to reduce the workforce
in a socially acceptable manner, this could nevertheless cause our relationships with employees and
employee representatives to deteriorate. Strikes associated with our operations could also damage
our reputation with customers or our public reputation.

In addition, many of our customers and suppliers also have unionized workforces. Refusals to work or
work downtime experienced by our customers or suppliers could reduce demand for our products or
prevent us from obtaining raw materials and other products required for our own production. Strikes
or labor disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition,
cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our operations rely on complex information technology systems and networks, and interruptions of_**
**_these systems and networks, or a material breach in security relating to our information systems,_**
**_could adversely affect us and our business operations._**

We rely heavily on centralized, standardized information technology systems and networks to
support business processes, as well as internal and external communications. These systems and
networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources and to
security threats, including cyberattacks and espionage. An extended outage in a data center or
telecommunications network utilized by our systems, security breaches or any similar event could
lead to an extended and unanticipated interruption of our systems or networks and affect our
production and other operations. In addition, it is possible that a malfunction of our data system
security measures could enable unauthorized persons to access sensitive business data, including
information relating to our intellectual property, business strategy or confidential customer data.
Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data
or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not
limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or
unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our in-house employees,
vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or statesponsored organizations. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part
because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet, and the increased
sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other
external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign
governments. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious
software, phishing and spear phishing attacks, wire fraud and payment diversion, account and email
takeover attacks, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic
security breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, customer perception of the
effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed which could result in the loss of customers.
Similar risks exist in case of interruption, malfunction or data leakage with respect to information
technology systems of third-party providers that we cooperate with. An incident involving disclosure,
data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure could subject us to
significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions
and fines, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our
customers increasingly require us to maintain an information security management system based on
certain industry standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001/TISAX, and reflecting national and sector-specific
regulations. If we fail to implement or maintain security systems required by our customers, this
could have an adverse effect on our customer relationships and we may be in breach of our
contractual obligations. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches and other
cybersecurity attacks and may incur significant additional costs to address issues caused by any such
breaches or cybersecurity attacks.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.


-----

**_We could be adversely affected by property losses and unforeseen business interruptions._**

Damage and loss caused by fire, accidents, natural disasters, terrorism, severe weather or other
disruptions of our production process at our facilities or within our supply chain, with respect to
customers and suppliers, can be severe. We, our suppliers and our customers have also been
affected by mandatory or voluntary site closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a
result of the war in Ukraine. In addition, as a result of the war in Ukraine, a number of companies,
including ourselves and a number of our customers, have announced plans to divest interests or
otherwise curtail business dealings in Russia and/or with Russian businesses, or have been required
to halt, reduce or delay production due to the unavailability of raw materials or components, such as
springs and friction linings, which adversely affects those customers’ demand for our products and
we, our suppliers and our customers may also be affected by related countermeasures, such as the
seizure of the assets of U.S. and European companies and persons located in Russia or territories
under its control. Such risks arising from business interruption and loss of production are insured at
levels considered economically reasonable and on standard market terms by us, but our insurance
coverage could prove insufficient in individual cases. Furthermore, such events could injure or kill
individuals or damage or destroy third-party property or the environment, which could, among other
things, lead to considerable financial costs for us. In addition, our manufacturing processes are
dependent on critical pieces of equipment such as furnaces, as well as machines and electrical
equipment such as transformers, and this equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result
of unanticipated failures, which may result in production bottlenecks and breakdowns, particularly
where a manufacturing site only operates a single unit of a particular type of equipment, which is the
case at several production locations. The materialization of any of the risks described above could
have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results
of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may be insufficient, and we may be unable to completely insure certain_**
**_risks or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future._**

We have taken out insurance coverage for a number of risks, including property damage, product
liability (including extended product liability and automotive recall liability, cybersecurity liability,
damage to rented property and environmental damage liability). There is no guarantee that our
insurance policies will adequately cover all material risks we face. Some risks cannot be insured, and
for certain risks and in certain locations, insurance may not be available or may be available only at
costs that are not economically viable. We cannot guarantee that one or more events will occur for
which the Schaeffler Group is uncompensated or undercompensated by insurance. Furthermore, our
insurance coverage could lapse due to unintentional non-payment of insurance premiums.

Following a number of claims or after a major claim, insurance premiums may be increased or the
terms and conditions of insurance coverage may become less favorable. This may also occur due to a
general change in the insurance markets. There is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to
obtain sufficient levels of insurance on terms and conditions that are economically viable.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with changes in exchange rates and hedging and exchange rate_**
**_fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations._**

We operate worldwide and are therefore exposed to financial risks that arise from changes in
exchange rates. Exchange rate fluctuations could cause losses if assets denominated in currencies
with a falling exchange rate lose value, while at the same time liabilities denominated in currencies
with a rising exchange rate appreciate. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could
increase or minimize fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, since we purchase a considerable


-----

part of the raw materials which we source in foreign currencies. As a result of these factors,
fluctuations in exchange rates and, in particular a significant appreciation of the euro against other
major currencies, could adversely affect our results of operations.

External and internal transactions involving the delivery of products and services to and/or by third
parties result in cash inflows and outflows which are denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency of our respective group member. We are particularly exposed to fluctuations of
net inflows in U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi. To the extent that cash outflows of our respective
group member in any one foreign currency are not offset by cash inflows resulting from operational
business in such currency, the remaining net foreign currency exposure is generally hedged in line
with the existing hedging strategy for the net exposure of the next twelve months, using derivative
financial instruments, and in particular forward exchange contracts. The foreign exchange risk is
concentrated at the group level, to the extent allowed, and hedged on a net basis. Current market
environment is taken into account in execution of the hedging strategy.

However, the future use of derivative hedging instruments is generally dependent on the availability
of adequate credit lines with appropriate financial institutions. As a result, we may be unable to use
derivative financial instruments in the future, to the extent necessary, and our hedging strategy could
therefore ultimately be adversely affected. Furthermore, any hedging transactions executed in the
form of derivative financial instruments may adversely affect our profit due to changes in the markto-market valuation if hedge accounting is not applied.

In addition, we are exposed to exchange rate risks arising from external and internal loan
agreements, which result from cash inflows and outflows in currencies other than the functional
currency of our respective group member. These exchange rate risks are, in general, hedged against
by using appropriate derivative financial instruments, and in particular currency forwards/swaps and
cross-currency interest rate swaps. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

Our net foreign investments are generally not hedged against exchange rate fluctuations. In addition,
a number of our consolidated companies report their results in currencies other than the euro, which
requires us to convert the relevant items into euro when preparing our consolidated financial
statements. Translation risks are generally not hedged.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to implement our efficiency and portfolio optimization and growth programs_**
**_successfully._**

We have been and continue to implement various strategic initiatives to improve the profitability and
operational efficiency of our Divisions, such as our efficiency and portfolio optimization subprograms
and other structural measures aimed at increasing efficiency, including the restructuring measures
we announced in November 2022.

The impact of these programs on our profitability may be influenced by a number of factors,
including our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, our ability to generate the
targeted efficiency and operating improvements we expect or that are necessary to enable us to
effectively compete, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, decline in morale
and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to our inability to retain or recruit key
employees. If the implementation of any of these programs, or any other program that we may
implement in order to increase efficiency and optimize our portfolio, is not successful and the
targeted efficiency and operating improvements cannot be realized, our results of operations could
be adversely affected. Even if we achieve the expected benefits, they may not be achieved within the
anticipated time frame and may cause additional costs, including costs that we do not and cannot
currently foresee. Any of these programs may cause our relationships with employees and employee


-----

representatives to deteriorate. See “—Our business could be adversely impacted by strikes and other
_labor disputes.” The efficiency and operating improvements anticipated by us are based on estimates_
and assumptions made by us that are inherently uncertain, although considered reasonable by us,
and may be subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and
contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and a number of which are beyond our control. As a
result, there can be no assurance that such efficiency and operating improvements will be achieved.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our future results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by our targets and_**
**_expectations._**

In connection with our Roadmap 2025, we publicly announced certain financial and operating targets
for the Schaeffler Group and its individual Divisions. The actual results we achieve may differ
materially from our targets. These targets are based upon a number of expectations, which are
subject to significant business, operational, economic and other risks set forth in this “Risk Factors”
section, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, the assumptions may not continue to
reflect the commercial, regulatory and economic environment in which we operate. Accordingly,
such assumptions that underlie our expectations may change or may not materialize at all. Should we
fail to achieve one or more of our targets, this may have a material adverse impact on our share price
and market value.

### Risks related to our Financing

**_The Issuer depends on dividend payments from its investments to meet its debt service obligations._**

As the Issuer is a holding and finance company with limited assets and conducts no business of its
own, its ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, its financial indebtedness, including
the Notes, will depend entirely on cash flows from Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG and
any other future subsidiaries or investments, which in turn depends on the future financial and
operating performance of those companies. The financial and operating performance of these
companies will be affected by general economic conditions and by financial, competitive, regulatory
and other factors beyond their control.

The amount of dividends received by the Issuer has varied significantly in the recent past. The
aggregate dividends the Issuer received from Schaeffler AG and Continental AG declined from €436
million in 2020 to €120 million in 2021. Dividends received from Schaeffler AG declined from €220
million in 2020 to €120 million in 2021; dividends received from Continental AG declined from €216
million in 2020 to no dividend in 2021. In light of its negative net income in 2020, Continental AG did
not pay any divided in 2021. Vitesco AG was spun-off from Continental AG in September 2021, has
not paid any dividends so far and indicated that it will not pay dividends until 2024 during its capital
markets day presentation on October 11, 2022. Although dividends received by the Issuer from
Schaeffler AG and Continental AG increased again in 2022, to an aggregate amount of €362 million
(€245 million from Schaeffler AG and €117 million from Continental AG (net of a withholding tax of
€42 million, which is expected to be credited against the corporate income tax liability for 2022, and
to the extent exceeding corporate income tax liability, it is expected to be reimbursed in 2023)) and
the boards of Schaeffler AG and the management board of Continental AG proposed dividends that,
if resolved and paid, would result in aggregate dividends for the Issuer of €300 million (net of an
expected withholding tax of €28 million related to the dividends received from Continental AG, which
is expected to be credited against the corporate income tax liability for 2023, and to the extent
exceeding corporate income tax liability, it is expected to be reimbursed in 2024) with respect to the
common shares held by the Issuer), there can be no assurance that the annual general meetings of
shareholders of Schaeffler AG or Continental AG will resolve on the dividends as proposed or that


-----

there will not be further reductions in dividends the Issuer receives or that the Issuer will receive
dividends in a timely manner or at all in the future. None of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG, Vitesco
AG or their respective subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us for payment on the
Notes and the terms of their financing arrangements, as well as applicable corporate law may restrict
them from paying dividends or making other distributions to the Issuer. There can be no assurance
that the agreements governing the current and future financing arrangements of Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG, Vitesco AG and their subsidiaries, or applicable corporate law, will permit them to
provide the Issuer with dividends, distributions or loans in an amount sufficient to enable the Issuer
to service its indebtedness, including the Notes. In addition to any restrictions on payment to the
Issuer contained in such financing arrangements, any failure to comply with the covenants and
restrictions contained in such financing arrangements could trigger defaults under those
arrangements which could delay or preclude the dividends, distributions, loans or any other similar
payments to the Issuer.

If Schaeffler AG, Continental AG or Vitesco AG raise additional equity without the Issuer (fully)
participating in such equity raise, the Issuer’s proportionate economic interest in Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG or Vitesco AG, as the case may be, and therefore its proportionate dividend
entitlement, would decline. A participation by the Issuer in any such capital raising by Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG or Vitesco AG, on the other hand, may require the Issuer to raise additional
indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with the Issuer’s substantial
indebtedness (see “—Risks related to the Notes and our Structure—Despite their substantial level of
_indebtedness, the Issuer and the Schaeffler Group will still be able to incur significant additional_
_amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with their substantial_
_indebtedness”) and is or will be subject to certain limitations under the agreements governing the_
Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness (see “—Existing debt obligations contain, and future debt
_obligations are likely to contain, restrictive covenants and change of control provisions.”)._

Additionally, the Schaeffler Group has incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness and uses a
significant portion of its cash flow to service its own financial debt, capital expenditure requirements
and other corporate needs. Accordingly, limited reliance should be placed on the Schaeffler Group’s
EBITDA, operating income and cash flow as indicators of the Issuer’s ability to service its debt
obligations, including the Notes.

If the Issuer is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to
undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring its debt, selling assets,
reducing or delaying investments or seeking to raise additional capital. The Issuer cannot assure you
that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold or, if sold, of the timing of the
sales and the amount of proceeds that may be realized from those sales, or that additional financing
could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. The Indenture and the Issuer’s other financing
arrangements will restrict the Issuer’s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the
disposition. The Issuer’s inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy its debt obligations, or to
refinance its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, would materially and adversely affect
its financial condition and results of operations and the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations under
the Notes.

**_The leverage and debt service obligations of the Issuer and the Schaeffler Group could make it_**
**_difficult for them to service their debt, including the Notes._**

As of December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer would
have had financial debt of €3,476 million. As of December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to €350 million of drawings under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility, the expected
drawing of the remaining €150 million available under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility and €3
million of acquired Ewellix debt, the Schaeffler Group would have had financial debt of €3,801 million
and lease liabilities of €219 million. The level of indebtedness of the Issuer and the Schaeffler Group


-----

could make it more difficult for them to satisfy their obligations with respect to their indebtedness
and have important consequences for investors in the Notes.

The substantial level of indebtedness at the level of the Schaeffler Group could, for example:

  - increase the Schaeffler Group’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and
developments;

  - require the Schaeffler Group to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
payments on their indebtedness, which could reduce the availability of cash flow to fund
working capital needs, capital expenditures, future acquisitions and other general corporate
needs;

  - limit the Schaeffler Group’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and
the industry in which it operates;

  - place the Schaeffler Group at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less
debt; and

  - limit the Schaeffler Group’s ability to borrow additional funds.

These or other factors could adversely affect the Schaeffler Group’s operating and financial
performance such that it is unable to pay dividends or otherwise make distributions to the Issuer,
which would make it difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under its financing arrangements,
including the Notes.

In addition, despite its high level of debt, the Issuer may be able to incur significant additional
amounts of debt, subject to compliance with certain covenants and other conditions under the
Indenture, the indentures governing the Existing Issuer Notes and the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement. Moreover, as none of the Indenture, the indentures governing the Existing Issuer Notes
nor the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement places any restrictions on the ability of Schaeffler AG
and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, these entities will only be subject to the restrictions, if
any, contained under their respective financing arrangements. See “—Risks related to the Notes and
_our Structure—Despite their substantial level of indebtedness, the Issuer and the Schaeffler Group will_
_still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks_
_associated with their substantial indebtedness” and “—Risks related to the Notes and our Structure—_
_Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and will not be_
_subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, will not guarantee the Notes and will not provide_
_any Collateral.”_

**_Existing debt obligations contain, and future debt obligations are likely to contain, restrictive_**
**_covenants and change of control provisions._**

Certain existing and future debt obligations, including the Notes, the Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Schaeffler
Group Notes and the Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes, contain, or will contain, a range of
restrictive covenants, representations and/or change of control provisions. In addition, the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement require
the respective entities to satisfy specified financial tests and maintain specified financial ratios. Under
the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Issuer will, among other things, be required to
maintain certain leverage ratios. In 2022, with a view to the current and anticipated impact of the
war in the Ukraine, the implementation of sanctions by several countries and the macroeconomic
situation in Europe, the U.S. and other countries in which the Schaeffler Group, Continental AG and
Vitesco AG have the majority of their business activities, the Issuer obtained a waiver of the financial
covenant under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Indebtedness of the Issuer—Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement—Financial Covenants.” Under the_
Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement, Schaeffler AG is generally required (subject to the


-----

fall-away date concept (see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Schaeffler
_Group—Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement—Fall-Away Date: fall-away of_
_covenants.”)) to maintain a financial ratio regarding a maximum level of consolidated total net debt_
to adjusted consolidated EBITDA.

In light of the cyclical nature of the business of the Schaeffler Group, Continental AG and Vitesco AG
and its possible effects on their business activities and results of operations as well as the other
market and business-related risks described in more detail under “—Risks related to our Business
_Operations and the Markets in which we operate,” the Issuer and its subsidiaries may not be able to_
maintain their current revenue and profitability at the levels required for meeting the EBITDA related
financial tests. Hence, the Issuer and its subsidiaries cannot assure you that they will continue to
comply with these financial covenants in the future.

Any debt financing the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries may incur in the future may contain similar
covenants, representations and change of control provisions. If the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries
fails to comply with any of these covenants or representations or if a change of control occurs, and
the respective lenders do not grant a waiver, a default or early repayment event could result under
the relevant debt instrument, which then could be declared to be immediately due and payable
and/or would become immediately due and payable. Under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement, in the event of a default, the relevant lenders could also require the Issuer to apply all
available cash to repay the borrowings or prevent the Issuer from making debt service payments on
the Notes, any of which would be an event of default under the Notes. If any debt outstanding under
the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Existing Issuer Notes or the Notes were to be
accelerated, the Issuer cannot assure you that its assets would be sufficient to repay such debt in full.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and thus on the Issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the
Notes or cause the market price of the Notes to decline.

**_The Issuer is exposed to risks in connection with its share interests in Continental AG and Vitesco_**
**_AG._**

Continental AG and Vitesco AG, in which the Issuer has 36.0% and 39.9% share interests,
respectively, are the Issuer’s major associated companies. Continental AG reported a net loss of
€1,171 million in 2019 and of €919 million in 2020 and only returned to profitability in 2021,
reporting net income of €1,507 million in that year and €112 million in 2022. Vitesco AG, which was
part of the Continental AG group until its spin-off in September 2021, reported a net loss of €363
million in 2020 and net loss of €122 million in 2021 and net loss of €14 million for the period ended
September 30, 2022. A variety of factors that are partially or entirely beyond our, Continental AG’s
and Vitesco AG’s control, such as a downturn in certain of Continental AG’s and Vitesco AG’s core
markets, the war in Ukraine and other conflicts, price inflation and higher interest rates, the COVID19 pandemic or a similar crisis, have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the results
of operations and business prospects of the Continental Group and/or Vitesco Group. Most of the
risks described under “—Risks related to our Business Operations and the Markets in which we
_operate” and “—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks” similarly apply to Continental AG and Vitesco AG_
and their respective subsidiaries. Given our limited access to information regarding Continental AG’s
and Vitesco AG’s operations, Continental AG and Vitesco AG may also be subject to significant risks of
which we are unaware, including legal, regulatory, tax and other risks. Any fluctuation of Continental
AG’s or Vitesco AG’s results or material adverse change to Continental AG’s or Vitesco AG’s trading
position and growth prospects could adversely affect Continental AG’s and/or Vitesco AG’s ability to
pay dividends to the Issuer, could lead to a decrease in the carrying amount of our investment in
Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG or require us to make impairment adjustments with respect to our
share interest in Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG, which would directly adversely affect our net
assets and financial position or our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.


-----

**_The Issuer and the Schaeffler Group are exposed to risks in connection with rising interest rates and_**
**_associated hedging and interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect the Issuer’s and the_**
**_Schaeffler Group’s results of operations._**

The Issuer and the Schaeffler Group are exposed to risks associated with changes in variable interest
rates, as certain of their indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate, such as loans under the
Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes
(Schuldscheine) and drawings under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement. These interest rates
have risen recently as central banks have increased rates and could continue to rise significantly in
the future, increasing interest expenses, reducing cash flows available for working capital and capital
expenditures and increasing their future refinancing costs. To the extent the Issuer’s or Schaeffler
Group’s financial debt instruments include features that provide for an increase in interest rates or
principal payments in case certain sustainability targets are not achieved, such as the Notes, the
Issuer and/or Schaeffler Group are also exposed to the risk of higher interest expenses or debt
repayment obligations if these targets are not achieved.

Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these variable
rates, the use of derivative interest rate hedging instruments is generally dependent on the
availability of adequate credit lines with appropriate financial institutions. As a result, the Issuer and
the Schaeffler Group may be unable to use derivative financial instruments in the future to the extent
necessary, and their hedging strategy could therefore ultimately be adversely impacted. In addition,
any hedging transactions executed in the form of derivative financial instruments may result in markto-market losses and may subject us to the risk that the banks acting as counterparties to such
transactions default on their obligations. Rising market interest rates will also increase the interest
expenses of fixed rate debt instruments when they are refinanced in the future.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the Schaeffler Group, which could in turn
adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the Notes or cause the market price
of the Notes to decline.

### Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks 

**_Our compliance management system may fail to prevent or detect corruption, fraud, money_**
**_laundering, other criminal or unauthorized behavior or violations of trade and economic sanctions_**
**_rules._**

We have adopted a worldwide risk management and compliance management system that is aimed,
among other things, at preventing corruption, fraud, money laundering, financing of terrorism and
other criminal or unauthorized behavior by our managers, employees, consultants, agents and
business partners. Although our global compliance organization continuously seeks to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of this system, the compliance management system could fail to prevent
or detect willful illegal, in particular collusive, behavior circumventing existing safeguards and
controls. Similarly, our risk management function could fail to identify, mitigate or manage relevant
risk exposures. Furthermore, it is possible that violations of existing law could occur despite careful
observance of such legal requirements.

If our managers, employees, consultants, agents or business partners engage in corruption, fraud or
other criminal or unauthorized behavior, we could be subject to administrative, civil or criminal fines
or other sanctions, such as the loss of business licenses or permits or other restrictions. Potential
wrongdoing by our managers, employees, consultants, agents or business partners could also
damage our reputation and have an adverse impact on our ability to compete for business.

Our international operations also require us to comply with economic sanctions, export controls, or
other trade restrictions imposed by the EU, the U.S. or other governments or organizations, and we


-----

are monitoring developments in and compliance with such sanctions programs. If we fail to comply
with economic sanctions and export control laws applicable to us, we may be subject to fines,
monetary assessments, and other penalties. Governments may also seek to impose modifications to
compliance management systems, or implement new compliance legislation, which may increase our
compliance costs further. New economic sanctions and export controls, like those issued by the U.S.,
EU, and the UK in response to the war in Ukraine, may evolve quickly and unpredictably, with new
requirements or prohibitions potentially coming into force with little or no notice and with
immediate effect. See “Regulatory Framework—Export Control Regulations and Economic Sanctions.”
These rapidly evolving and increasingly severe economic sanctions and export controls have
impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and may increase our compliance
costs.

In addition, in 2021, the U.S. adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which significantly
restricts imports from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China (“Xinjiang”) into the U.S., and
heightens the risk of regulatory enforcement for businesses with connections to Xinjiang through
their supply chains. The U.S. government has also taken several recent actions connected to the
situation in Xinjiang, including supply chain advisories and sanctions on specific entities tied to
Xinjiang forced labor. Germany also adopted the German Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains
Act (Gesetz über die unternehmerischen Sorgfaltspflichten in Lieferketten) in 2021, which imposes
due diligence and reporting obligations on companies with respect to the compliance of their supply
chains with human rights and certain environmental standards. In addition, on February 23, 2022, the
European Commission issued a proposal for a Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence
that proposes to impose more extensive obligations on companies than the German Corporate Due
Diligence in Supply Chains Act, including the introduction of a civil liability regime which would allow
victims to sue companies for damages related to non-compliance with its due diligence
requirements. An expansion of economic sanctions programs, embargoes, and other trade
restrictions in the future, or modifications in how existing economic sanctions are interpreted or
enforced, may adversely affect our business operations.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our material compliance management system may fail to prevent us from distributing products in_**
**_the market in violation of the law or in non-compliance with customer specifications._**

We use a material compliance management system and processes to help us meet our commitment
to use only components and raw materials that comply with applicable laws and regulations and to
deliver products that meet all customer specifications. To that end, we conduct comprehensive legal
monitoring of all relevant and prioritized markets, including with the help of external information
services. However, there is a risk that changes in requirements relating to materials are not identified
in time or not taken into account during production, which could result in products being distributed
in the market in violation of the law or products being delivered to customers that do not meet a
customer’s specifications. In case of violations of laws and regulations or delivery of products that do
not meet a customer’s specification, we could be subject to administrative or criminal fines or other
sanctions. We could also be exposed to civil damage claims from direct or indirect purchasers of the
affected products. Finally, potential violations could also damage our reputation or negatively impact
the perception of our products.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.


-----

**_We are involved in legal, administrative and arbitration proceedings and may be obligated to pay_**
**_substantial damages or incur additional costs._**

Companies of Schaeffler Group are involved in a number of legal, administrative and arbitration
proceedings and could become involved in additional legal, administrative and arbitration
proceedings. These proceedings or potential proceedings could involve, particularly in the United
States, substantial claims for damages or other payments. Based on judgments or settlement
agreements, we could be obligated to pay substantial damages. Our litigation costs and those of third
parties could also be significant. See “Business—Environmental Regulation, Compliance, Insurance
_and Legal—Litigation and Administrative Proceedings.”_

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We have been subject to industry-wide antitrust investigations, and civil lawsuits that have_**
**_resulted in substantial fines and civil damages; some of these are still ongoing._**

Since 2011, various antitrust authorities have been investigating several manufacturers of bearings
and other products, particularly for the automotive and other industrial sectors. The authorities
investigated possible agreements and concerted practices violating antitrust laws and we have paid
substantial fines in connection with these proceedings in the past. Although most of these
investigations were closed, an investigation in Brazil remains open.

If any competent antitrust authority concludes that we participated in anti-competitive practices, it
may seek to impose a fine. Furthermore, prosecutors may initiate criminal proceedings against us or
our employees where applicable. We have also been subject to follow-on civil damages claims, many
of which were settled, but some of which remain ongoing, and we may be exposed to additional
claims from potentially affected parties. See “Business—Environmental Regulation, Compliance,
_Insurance and Legal—Litigation and Administrative Proceedings.”_

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting and payment_**
**_transactions, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely._**

An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and
is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud. We periodically evaluate the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting and
payment transactions. Based on these evaluations, we have concluded in the past and may conclude
in the future that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or
desirable.

While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these
controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal
controls, including fraud, collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In
addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable
financial reports or prevent fraud. In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by
regulatory authorities. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets
due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.


-----

**_We are exposed to warranty and product liability claims and may incur additional costs in_**
**_connection with such claims._**

As a manufacturer, we are subject to product liability lawsuits and other proceedings alleging
violations of due care, violations of warranty obligations, treatment errors and claims arising from
breaches of contract, recall actions or fines imposed by government or regulatory authorities. In
addition, with the increasing number of digitally enabled service solutions, such as cloud based
monitoring, cybersecurity risks could also lead to warranty and liability claims in the future. Any such
lawsuits, proceedings or other claims could result in increased costs and reputational damage. For
example, we are currently in discussions with several of our customers regarding potential warranty
claims such customers may have related to the failure of certain bearings we supplied for wind
turbines. Also, on February 23, 2023, the OEM Chrysler submitted a recall notification to the U.S.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). Chrysler is recalling certain 2018-2023
Jeep Wranglers and 2020-2023 Jeep Gladiator vehicles equipped with manual transmissions (the
“Chrysler Recall”) because of the risk that the clutch pressure plate may overheat and fracture,
which may increase the risk of a fire and result in damage to other nearby components, which can
result in debris falling on the road or a loss of drive, increasing the risk of a crash. We delivered
clutches to Chrysler. We have been investigating whether our scope of supply contributed to these
risks. To our knowledge, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, a root cause investigation on
Chrysler’s overall system level is not yet completed. However, it is possible that Chrysler may seek to
hold us liable for this issue. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Chrysler has not submitted
a claim to us related to the Chrysler Recall. The risks arising from such warranty and product liability
lawsuits, proceedings and other claims are insured up to levels we consider economically reasonable
and on standard market terms, but the insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual
cases.

In addition, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly requiring a contribution from their suppliers for
potential product liability, warranty and recall claims, and we have been subject to continuing efforts
by our customers to change contract terms and conditions concerning warranty and recall
participation.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We may have to repay investment grants and subsidies, or previously awarded investment grants_**
**_may not be disbursed in part or at all._**

A part of our investment requirements for developing and expanding our production capacity is
covered by public aid, such as subsidies, loans at favorable conditions or tax reductions or
exemptions. The public aid we received is subject to various conditions such as the creation of jobs or
the carrying out of certain R&D activities. If these conditions are not fulfilled during the commitment
period, which generally exceeds the specified investment period, this could result in a repayment
claim by the relevant authorities for the public aid received by us.

Subsidy-related repayment claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual property and technical_**
**_expertise._**

Our products and services are highly dependent upon our technological know-how and the scope and
limitations of our proprietary rights therein. We have obtained and applied for a large number of
intellectual property rights, such as patents, that are of considerable importance to our business. The
process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive. Furthermore, patents may not be
granted on currently pending or future applications or may not be sufficient in scope, duration or


-----

strength to provide us with meaningful protection or a commercial advantage and are subject to
expiry. A major part of our know-how and industrial secrets is not patented and cannot be protected
through intellectual property rights. Consequently, there is a risk that third parties, in particular
competitors, could copy our know-how without incurring comparable expenses of their own.

In addition, while there is a presumption that patents are valid, the granting of a patent does not
necessarily guarantee that it is effective or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree
necessary or desired. Thus, even where our intellectual property is subject to patents or other
intellectual property rights, we may not be able to enforce these rights effectively, and the
unauthorized use of our intellectual property, such as product piracy, could harm our revenues and
damage our reputation.

In addition, we entered into a number of license, cross-license, cooperation and development
agreements with our customers, competitors and other third parties under which we are granted
access to intellectual property or know-how of such third parties. It is possible that license
agreements could be terminated under unexpected circumstances such as a licensing partner’s
insolvency or bankruptcy or in the event of a change of control in either party, leaving us with
reduced access to intellectual property rights to commercialize our own technologies. Furthermore,
the licensed patents may be invalid.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_There is a risk that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and could_**
**_therefore be forced to change our product offering or be exposed to additional costs._**

Our competitors, suppliers and customers also submit a large number of inventions for intellectual
property protection, such as for patents and utility models. It is not always possible to determine
with certainty whether there are effective and enforceable third-party intellectual property rights to
certain processes, methods or applications. Therefore, third parties could assert infringement claims,
including baseless claims, against us. As a result, we could be forced to cease manufacturing, using or
marketing the relevant technologies or products in certain countries or to make changes to
manufacturing processes or products. In addition, we could be liable to pay compensation for
infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses from third parties to make use of technology.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We might not have validly acquired employee inventions or could possibly fail to validly acquire_**
**_them in the future._**

There is a risk that we have failed or will fail to properly claim inventions of our employees. Present
or former employees who made or make employee inventions might continue to own the rights to
inventions if we fail to claim such inventions in a timely manner. If we nevertheless registered an
employee invention or utility model in our name and/or used an employee invention as such, then
the respective employee may have a claim for transfer of the patent or utility model, as the case may
be, against us, and might be able to assert claims for damages for the unauthorized use of his or her
invention or utility model (e.g., disgorgement of profits or notional license fees). In addition, a claim
could be asserted against us to enjoin our use of the invention, we could be forced to enter into a
license agreement providing for the payment of royalties in order to use the invention in the future,
or we might have to acquire the invention. Furthermore, employees may have claims for employee
invention compensation which have not yet been fully satisfied.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We may incur additional costs as a result of industry-wide collective bargaining agreements_**
**_applicable to our employees._**

A significant number of our employees in various countries (e.g., Germany, France, Hungary,
Romania, Slovakia, South Korea and Brazil) are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If
industry-wide collective bargaining agreements which apply to us are amended to the effect that
they foresee increased benefits for employees in the future, this may lead to higher employment
costs and higher social security contributions for the past and future.

Increased costs due to amendments to collective bargaining agreements could have a material
adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks in connection with our pension obligations, which may lead to unexpected_**
**_funding obligations._**

We have substantial pension obligations and other employee benefit obligations, most of which are
not covered by underlying plan assets. We provide defined benefit pension plans in Germany, the
United States, the United Kingdom and certain other countries. As of December 31, 2022, our
defined benefit obligations amounted to €2,287 million using an average discount rate of 4.1%. Total
provisions recognized for these commitments amounted to €1,606 million as of December 31, 2022.

Our externally invested pension plan assets are funded through externally managed investment
funds. While we prescribe the general investment-strategies applied by these funds, we do not
determine their individual investment alternatives. The assets are invested in different asset classes
including stocks, fixed-income securities and real estate. The values attributable to the externally
invested pension plan assets are subject to market fluctuations that are beyond our influence.

The amount of our total provisions for pension obligations depends on the development of the
present value of our defined benefit obligations and the fair value of the assets available to fund such
obligations. The present value of our pension obligations and other long-term benefit obligations is
significantly influenced by the discount rate used. Furthermore, the longevity and actuarial profile of
plan participants may have a negative impact on pension obligations. Pension obligations and other
long-term benefit obligations may also be affected by legal and regulatory developments and
changes in case law. The amount determined is based on various assumptions, and any change in
legal requirements or in the interpretation thereof with regard to the calculation of pension
obligations or other long-term benefit obligations may have a material impact on the amount of our
pension and benefit obligations and thus on their present value.

Any increase in the amount of our defined benefit obligations could adversely affect our financial
condition due to additional outflow of funds to finance these obligations or could lead to a
depreciation of our equity.

Furthermore, certain of our U.S.-based subsidiaries have entered into obligations to make
contributions to healthcare costs of their former employees. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk
that these costs will increase in the future (for example, due to the longevity of our obligations and
interest rate changes).

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations, particularly under applicable_**
**_environmental laws, the violation of which could lead to significant liabilities._**

The nature of our business subjects us to significant government regulation, including increasingly
stringent environmental laws and regulations in most jurisdictions where we operate. Such laws and
regulations require us to obtain permits or authorizations and impose recordkeeping and reporting
obligations in connection with the operation of our business. These regulatory frameworks impose


-----

significant day-to-day compliance burdens, costs, and risks on us. For example, certain environmental
permits, including those issued by regulators of air quality, often require us to install and operate air
emissions control equipment. Violations of such laws and regulations may give rise to significant
liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, monetary and reputational damages, third-party
liabilities, and limitations on our business operations and site closures. While Schaeffler Group has
established an integrated environment, health and safety management system, there can be no
assurance that we have been and will at all times be in full compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health, including regulations
concerning employee health and safety.

Globally, governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the
selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing
green chemistry, life cycle analysis, and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad
regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect
OEMs’ responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle’s life, as well as chemical
selection for product development and manufacturing. For example, we are subject to Regulation
(EC) No. 1907/2006 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”)).
Several of the chemicals we use are or may be classified as substances of very high concern and are
or could become subject to restrictions on use or become prohibited. If chemicals we use become
subject to further restrictions on use or are prohibited, we could need to identify alternatives, which
could be significantly more expensive, which may have a financial impact on our business operations.

We are also subject to increasingly stringent data protection and privacy requirements, such as
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”)), violation of
which carries substantial fines and grants individual data subjects the right to claim damages for
violations. The GDPR introduced extensive documentation obligations and considerably higher
transparency requirements, which affect not only initial data collection but also the further use and
processing of personal data once personal data has been collected. Although we strive to comply
with all applicable laws, regulations and legal obligations relating to data protection and privacy, it is
possible that these laws, regulations and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a
manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our
practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations and other legal
obligations. Any non-compliance with the applicable regulations could lead to fines and other
sanctions or reputational damage.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_We could become subject to additional burdensome environmental, safety or other regulations and_**
**_additional regulation could adversely affect demand for our products and services._**

We must observe a large number of different regulatory systems across the world that change
frequently and are continuously evolving and becoming more stringent, in particular with respect to
the environment, chemicals, hazardous materials and health. This applies also to air, water, soil
pollution, climate change, and waste regulations, all of which have recently become more stringent
through the enactment of new laws or amended of existing laws, in particular, at the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe level, in the EU, the United States and China. In the past, adjusting
to new regulations has required significant investments, and it is likely that further significant
investments in this regard will be required in the future. In particular, climate change laws (including
cap and trade systems and carbon taxes) are rapidly changing, and new or modified climate change
laws may impose additional material environmental liability. Such laws include those directly
regulating our climate change impacts and those which regulate the climate change impacts of
companies with which we do business, such as utilities providing electricity to our facilities.


-----

Many of our products are subject to comprehensive and constantly changing regulatory
requirements that are not always homogeneous worldwide. These national and international
regulations can impact the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of our products and services and
are subject to increasing governmental scrutiny and enforcement. A violation of applicable
regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties, fines, damages, reputational harm and other
adverse consequences. Furthermore, any additional regulation restricting or limiting car traffic with
an aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions could lead to a material decrease in car sales and
consequently adversely affect demand for our products and services.

Our customers’ motor vehicle products are subject to extensive regulations, including those related to
vehicle emissions, fuel economy standards, and greenhouse gas emissions, and such regulations
could impact our customers’ demand for our products. For example, in the past few years, numerous
governments (including those of China, the United Kingdom, France, the EU and Canada) have
proposed disallowing the sale of new motor vehicles with internal combustion engines at some point
in the future between 2030 and 2050, which represents a significant technological shift. In February
2023, the EU Parliament adopted the EU Commission’s July 14, 2021 proposal to amend Regulation
2019/631, which aims to accelerate the transition to low- and zero emission vehicles by requiring
average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to be reduced by 55% by
2023 and 100% by 2035, each as compared to 2021 levels. This would mean that all new vehicles
registered on or after January 1, 2035 would be required to have zero CO2 emissions. In addition, on
February 14, 2022, the EU Commission proposed amending Regulation 2019/1242 to strengthen CO2
emission performance standards for new heavy duty vehicles by requiring average CO2 emissions of
most new heavy duty vehicles to be reduced by 45% by 2030, 65% by 2035 and 90% by 2040, each as
compared to 2019 levels, as well as requiring that all new city buses have zero CO2 emissions as of
2030. See also “—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We could become subject to additional
_burdensome environmental, safety or other regulations and additional regulation could adversely_
_affect demand for our products and services.”_

We may need to substantially modify product plans to comply with such regulations, and to
successfully respond to evolving business models (including electric vehicle advances, lower emission
vehicles, and new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines). In addition, when the
Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (the “WLTP”) was implemented in 2018, it had
a significant negative impact on sales of light duty vehicles. All light duty vehicles sold after
September 1, 2018 must be certified in accordance with the WLTP, a test procedure to measure fuel
and energy consumption, CO2 and pollutants emissions and electric range of light duty vehicles. This
requirement resulted in significant supply-side issues as some of our OEMs customers experienced
delays in certifying their models, thereby affecting deliveries to end-customers. These developments
in turn had a negative impact on our business and results of operations. The framework was
amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1832 of November 5, 2018 (the “WLTP 2nd Act”) and
the first changes became effective on January 1, 2019. Since September 1, 2019, the Real Driving
Emissions Procedure (the “RDE”) applies to all new car registrations. See “Regulatory Framework—
_Regulatory Framework for our Operations and Products in Europe—Emissions from Vehicles—_
_Pollutant Emissions.” These changes may result in increased and additional WLTP and RDE testing_
requirements and a requirement to recertify current models. The materialization of any of the risks
described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition,
cash flows and results of operations.

**_We could be held liable for soil, water or groundwater contamination or for risks related to_**
**_hazardous materials._**

Many of the sites at which we operate have been used for industrial purposes for many years,
leading to risks of contamination and resulting investigation, cleanup and other obligations. We could
also be held responsible for the remediation of areas adjacent to our sites or for natural resources


-----

damages. In the past, soil, water and/or groundwater contamination has been discovered both at
sites we currently operate and sites we operated in the past. Due to contamination laws in various
jurisdictions, the competent authorities, as well as neighbors, NGOs, or other private parties, could
assert claims against us, as the owner or tenant of the affected plots regardless of fault, for the
examination or remediation of such soil, water and/or groundwater contamination, or order us to
dispose of, or to treat, contaminated soil excavated in the course of construction. Many of these laws
impose liability regardless of fault or knowledge, and the liability may be retroactive, and joint and
several. This means that we could be held responsible for the entire cost of addressing contamination
at particular locations, even if we complied with relevant laws, there are other potentially
responsible parties, or we did not cause or even know about the underlying issue. We may also be
required to indemnify the owners of plots leased by us or of other properties, if the authorities were
to pursue claims against the relevant owner of the property for contamination that we have caused.
On several of the sites where contamination has been discovered, remediation activities have already
taken place upon order by, or agreement with, the competent authorities. Costs incurred in
connection with such claims are generally difficult to predict. If any contamination were to become a
subject of public discussion, there is a risk that our reputation or relations with our customers could
be adversely affected.

We could also be exposed to claims alleging that the health and safety of third parties, such as
nearby current or former residents or current or former employees, was affected due to soil, water
or groundwater contamination or the use of hazardous materials. For example, certain former
residents of a local community near our plant in Joplin, Missouri, U.S. have brought claims for
damages against certain of our subsidiaries, alleging exposure to toxic chemicals in the water; see
“Business—Environmental Regulation, Compliance, Insurance and Legal—Litigation and
_Administrative Proceedings—Contamination Claims.” Furthermore, at some of the sites at which we_
operate, hazardous materials, such as asbestos-containing building materials used for heat insulation,
were used in the past, which could expose us to claims. We face similar risks with respect to former
sites which we have sold. Even if we have contractually excluded or limited our liability in connection
with the sale of such properties, we could be held responsible for currently unknown contamination
on properties which we previously owned or used.

In addition, manufacturers of clutch-lining materials are sometimes defendants in suits brought by
individuals claiming personal injuries as a result of alleged exposure to asbestos or asbestoscontaining products. Claims of this nature have been filed against certain of our subsidiaries in the
United States as a result of sales of clutch-lining material containing asbestos made until the end of
the 1980s.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Tax audits may lead to a substantial increase of our tax burden for past periods._**

The Issuer and many German and foreign companies of the Schaeffler Group are subject to routine
tax audits by the competent tax authorities. In ongoing or future tax audits, the tax laws or relevant
facts could be interpreted by the tax authorities in a manner deviating from our view. In addition,
companies of the Schaeffler Group are, or may become, involved in pending tax disputes with tax
authorities. As a result of ongoing or future tax audits or tax disputes, the tax authorities could revise
original tax assessments and substantially increase our tax burden (including interest and penalty
payments).

The Issuer and Schaeffler AG and its affiliates have set up certain tax provisions to address
identifiable risks in respect of uncertain tax positions. The unconsolidated financial statements of the
Issuer and the consolidated financial statements of Schaeffler AG included in this Offering
Memorandum include provisions and liabilities to cover potential exposure for tax audits regarding


-----

the Issuer or the companies of the Schaeffler Group. So far, we are not aware that there have been
any definitive significant findings which would not be covered by the tax provisions and liabilities we
have already accounted for. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that ongoing and/or future tax
audits will lead to additional tax expenses and/or payments.

The Issuer and Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries could incur unanticipated tax expenses in relation to
previous tax assessment periods which have not yet been subject to a tax audit or are currently
subject to a tax audit and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_The Issuer and the Schaeffler Group are affected by the German interest barrier and loss carry_**
**_forward utilization rules and this may increase their respective tax burdens._**

The German interest barrier rules generally provide for a limitation on the deduction of a business’
net interest expenses in a fiscal year to an amount equal to 30% of the tax-adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in such fiscal year (the definition of “interest expenses”
for interest barrier rule purposes is not free of doubt and therefore causes uncertainty). As a result,
annual refinancing expenses (interest payments and further expenses which qualify as interest
expenses within the meaning of the interest barrier rules) of the Issuer and the Schaeffler Group may
not be immediately deductible in full for tax purposes, but can be carried forward as interest-expense
carryforwards (Zinsvorträge). The Issuer and Schaeffler AG built up certain amounts of interestexpense carryforwards. In addition, the Issuer and Schaeffler AG built up certain amounts of loss
carryforwards. The loss relief brought forward claimable in any one year is limited to €1 million plus
60% of current income exceeding that amount. The remaining 40% of income exceeding the €1
million limit is charged to trade and corporation taxes at current rates. The timing of the recognition
of deferred tax assets on the interest-expense and loss carryforwards may affect our financial results.

**_Changes in tax laws and regulations may increase the tax burden of the Schaeffler Group and the_**
**_Issuer._**

The Schaeffler Group has operations in Germany and abroad. Therefore, the Schaeffler Group is
liable to pay taxes in Germany and many other jurisdictions. The tax burden of the Schaeffler Group
depends in particular on the interpretation of local tax regulations, bilateral or multilateral
international tax treaties and the administrative practices in each of these jurisdictions. Recent and
future changes in tax laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of rules, may have an impact on
the Schaeffler Group’s tax burden and/or result in disputes with tax authorities. In particular, recent
developments in international tax law triggered by the joint OECD-G20 project against Base Erosion
and Profit Shifting (BEPS) by multinational companies have resulted in amendments and may result in
additional amendments of existing principles of international tax law and a large number of new tax
provisions in many jurisdictions, including Germany and additional changes are expected. To date, no
sufficient guidance or experience is available to be able to reliably evaluate whether and to what
extent these tax law changes may have on the Issuer or the Schaeffler Group’s net profit after tax as
well as their respective cash flows, and we caution investors that they could be material and adverse.

### Risks related to the Notes and our Structure

**_Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and will not_**
**_be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, will not guarantee the Notes and will not_**
**_provide any Collateral._**

Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer under the Indenture.
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, will not
guarantee the Notes and will not provide any Collateral. As a consequence, Note Holders will have no


-----

recourse to any Unrestricted Subsidiary, its assets or its properties if there is an event of default
under the Indenture. Access by the Issuer to the cash flow generated by Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
including Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries, is limited to amounts actually distributed to the Issuer as
dividends or other distributions. See “—Risks related to our Financing—The Issuer depends on
_dividend payments from its investments to meet its debt service obligations.”_ Dividends are received,
if at all, in proportion to the Issuer’s economic interest in Schaeffler AG, which is 75.1% as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, holders of the remaining 24.9% interest in Schaeffler
AG, which are non-voting shares, will receive preferred dividends (€0.01 per share) before the Issuer.
Unrestricted Subsidiaries may also be unable, or subject to restrictions on their ability, to make
distributions to the Issuer, further limiting access to their cash flow. Since Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
including Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries, are not subject to the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture, they are free, among other things, to incur and secure indebtedness, sell assets and use
the proceeds therefrom in accordance with the terms of Schaeffler Group’s financing arrangements,
which could delay or preclude the distribution of dividend payments or any other similar payments
by such Unrestricted Subsidiaries to the Issuer. Defaults by Schaeffler AG or any of its subsidiaries
under any of their debt instruments, including any insolvency (other than an insolvency of Schaeffler
AG), will not result in a cross-default under the Indenture, and Note Holders will, therefore, not be
able to accelerate the maturity of the Notes even if the financial condition of Schaeffler AG and its
subsidiaries were to deteriorate significantly.

**_The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations_**
**_under the Notes._**

The Notes will, upon issuance, be secured by the Collateral. The assets subject to the Collateral are
also subject to security interests for the benefit of the other pari passu secured creditors, including
holders of the Existing Issuer Notes, lenders under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, certain
hedge counterparties and the holders of any future indebtedness that shares in the Collateral and
becomes subject to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement after the Issue Date. In
addition, the Indenture will allow the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness in the future
that is secured by such assets. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of any Collateral
would be dependent on numerous factors affecting the value of the assets subject to the Collateral at
the time of their enforcement. In addition, any failure of the Issuer to comply with the covenants of
its financing arrangements, including under the Existing Issuer Notes and the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement, may result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness thereunder
which could also negatively impact the value of the Collateral. In the event of a foreclosure,
liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral
may not be sufficient to repay the obligations under the Notes.

**_Note Holders will be able to direct the enforcement of the Collateral only under certain limited_**
**_circumstances._**

The Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be granted
directly to the Note Holders but will be granted only in favor of the Security Trustee. The Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture provide that only the Security
Trustee has the right to enforce the respective Collateral. As a consequence, Note Holders will not
have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral.

The Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Trustee may take
enforcement action with respect to any of the respective Collateral only upon the instruction of an
Instructing Group (as defined below). Any decision, instruction or consent requiring action by the
Instructing Group under the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, including decisions


-----

and instructions with respect to the enforcement of the Collateral, will be made in the form of a
resolution in the following manner:

  - Note Holders and holders of the Existing Issuer Notes (as well as holders of any notes or similar
debt instruments issued by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries in the future that are secured by
the Collateral and are subject to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement) will
be entitled to vote on the resolution, with series of notes denominated in different currencies
each voting separately as a class. The Indenture will provide that, within each voting class,
abstentions will be deemed to have voted either in favor of or against the resolution on a pro
rata basis in the same proportion as the aggregate principal amount with respect to which
votes were actually cast in favor of the resolution and against the resolution, respectively,
bears to the total principal amount with respect to which votes were actually cast. The Trustee
and the trustee for the Existing Issuer Notes (and any trustee for notes issued in the future that
become subject to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement) will report to the
Security Trustee the aggregate principal amount of notes of each currency that voted (or are
deemed or otherwise treated to have voted) in favor of the resolution and the aggregate
principal amount of notes of each currency that voted (or are deemed or otherwise treated to
have voted) against the resolution.

  - Lenders under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement (and under future facilities
agreements that become subject to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement)
will be entitled to vote on the resolution (separately for commitments under the same facilities
agreement denominated in different base currencies) in accordance with the provisions of the
relevant facilities agreement. The facility agent under the relevant facilities agreement will
report to the Security Trustee the aggregate amount of credit participations under the
respective facilities agreement that voted (or are deemed or otherwise treated under the
relevant facilities agreement to have voted) in favor of the resolution and the aggregate
amount of credit participations that voted (or are deemed or otherwise treated under the
relevant facilities agreement to have voted) against the resolution.

  - The Security Trustee will determine the euro-equivalent aggregate principal amount of notes
and aggregate amount of credit participations under the facilities agreements that voted (or
are deemed or otherwise treated to have voted) in favor of and against the resolution.

  - The resolution will be passed if the aggregate principal amount of notes and aggregate amount
of credit participations under the facilities agreements that voted (or are deemed or otherwise
treated to have voted) in favor of the resolution exceeds the aggregate principal amount of
notes and aggregate amount of credit participations under the facilities agreements that voted
(or are deemed or otherwise treated to have voted) against the resolution, in each case on a
euro-equivalent basis.

The Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement refers to any resolution passed in the
foregoing manner as a decision or resolution of the “Instructing Group” (the “Instructing Group”).

After giving effect to the Refinancing, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding,
together with the principal amount of Existing Issuer Notes outstanding, will constitute a majority of
the total commitments of all secured creditors subject to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement and entitled to vote thereunder. However, Note Holders may need to rely on other
secured creditors, whose interests may differ from those of the Note Holders, to direct the Security
Trustee to take enforcement action with respect to the respective Collateral.


-----

**_The Collateral will not be granted to the Note Holders directly, and, accordingly, the ability of the_**
**_Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral is subject to uncertainty under German law._**

Due to German law and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and
enforceability of such security interests, the Collateral will secure only a so-called “parallel debt”
obligation created under the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the
Security Trustee rather than secure the obligations under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in
the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes (the
“Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the
corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Trustee has, pursuant to the parallel debt,
a claim against the Issuer for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt construct has
not been tested in court in Germany and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy. Therefore, the
ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, Note Holders
bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Trustee. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**_Limitations on the enforceability and the amount of the Collateral may adversely affect its validity_**
**_and enforceability._**

The Collateral may be subject to claims or could be limited or subordinated in favor of the Issuer’s
existing and future creditors under applicable laws. In addition, enforcement of the Collateral will be
limited to the extent of the amount which can be secured by a security grantor without rendering the
security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under, or contrary to, applicable law. Enforcement
of any of the Collateral against the Issuer will also be subject to certain defenses available to grantors
of security interests generally. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, insolvency, voidable preference, initial over-collateralization and defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and similar
laws, a court could subordinate or void any security interest provided by such security grantor and, if
enforcement proceeds had already been applied, require that the recipient return the payment to
the relevant security provider, if it found that:

  - the security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or
shareholders of the respective security grantor;

  - the security interest granted excessively over-collateralized the secured claims;

  - the secured creditors have, or are deemed to have, a shareholder-like position; or

  - the security was granted close to or in an actual state of insolvency of the security grantor.

There is also a risk that the Collateral may be held invalid by a German court because the initial value
of the Collateral significantly exceeds the secured obligations (over-collateralization), including the
liabilities under the Notes. Under case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof), security arrangements granting excessive collateral may be invalid, if overall, in
light of the motivation of the secured parties and the purpose of the collateral, the taking of
excessive collateral is not reconcilable with good faith standards. The German Federal Supreme Court
has held that collateral is excessive, if it can be expected at the time the relevant security
arrangements are entered into, that the value of the collateral will be in obvious disproportion
(auffälliges Missverhältnis) to the amount of the secured obligations at the time of enforcement.
German courts have, however, not established specific numerical levels or ratios to determine
whether collateral is deemed to be excessive at the time the security arrangements are entered into.
A summary description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Collateral in


-----

respect of German law is set out in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Under German law, claims of Note Holders may not have a first priority ranking pari passu with_**
**_existing secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Existing Issuer Notes and the_**
**_Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, and investors must rely on the Issuer Security Pooling and_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement to achieve a first priority lien in the Collateral._**

Under German law, the liens securing the Notes are subject to legal doctrines that effectively rank
them behind the liens in favor of earlier incurred obligations, in particular the liens in favor of the
Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, and certain hedging obligations.
Therefore, the first priority status of the Notes depends on the enforceability of the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to
give effect to it, the Notes may rank behind other outstanding secured indebtedness.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the Issuer._**

None of the Schaeffler Group companies will guarantee the Notes and, as of the Issue Date, there will
not be any other subsidiaries of the Issuer that will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a liquidation,
winding-up or dissolution or a bankruptcy, administration, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or
similar proceeding of any such non-guarantor subsidiary, such subsidiary will pay the holders of its
own debt (including holders of third-party debt which such subsidiary has guaranteed), its trade
creditors and any preferred shareholders before it would be able to distribute any of its assets to the
Issuer. As a result of the foregoing, the Issuer may not have sufficient assets to make payments on
the Notes.

As of December 31, 2022, Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries had financial debt of €3,298 million and
€219 million in lease liabilities on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer would have had financial debt of €3,476 million. As
of December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to €350 million of drawings under the
Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility, the expected drawing of the remaining €150 million available
under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility and €3 million of acquired Ewellix debt, the Schaeffler
Group would have had financial debt of €3,801 million and lease liabilities of €219 million.

**_The Notes will be effectively subordinated to debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries to the extent_**
**_such debt is secured by assets that are not also securing the Notes._**

Although the Indenture will restrict the Issuer’s ability to provide asset security for the benefit of
other debt, both the restriction on incurring liens and the requirement to provide equal security to
the Notes will be subject to a number of significant exceptions and carve-outs. For example, if the
Issuer acquires assets subject to security interests securing other indebtedness, such security
interests will be grandfathered by the Indenture and will not trigger a requirement to secure the
Notes equally. To the extent the Issuer provides asset security for the benefit of other debt without
also securing the Notes, the Notes will be effectively junior to such debt to the extent of such assets.

As a result of the foregoing, holders of our (present or future) secured debt may recover
disproportionately more on their claims than the Note Holders in an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding. The Issuer may not have sufficient assets remaining to make payments on the Notes.

**_The Issuer has only limited control over the management of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and_**
**_Vitesco AG._**

Since Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG are companies incorporated as stock
corporations (Aktiengesellschaft) under German law, the Issuer is limited in the degree of control it
can exercise over the affairs of such companies. Each of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco


-----

AG is managed by its respective board of managing directors, which are not subject to instructions by
their respective shareholders’ meetings or respective supervisory boards, and members of their
respective boards of managing directors may only be removed for cause. As a result, Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG and Vitesco AG may incur or secure indebtedness or make other business decisions
without the approval of the Issuer. Members of the board of managing directors of a German stock
corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), such as Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG, have a legal
duty to act solely in the interests of their respective companies, and it is possible that the interests of
Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG may not be aligned, or even conflict with, the interests
of the Issuer.

Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG each have their own financing structure, which is
independent from the Issuer. However, if Schaeffler AG, Continental AG or Vitesco AG were unable to
conduct its business as anticipated, unable to obtain required debt financing at commercially
reasonable terms or at all or otherwise in need of additional funding in order to develop its business,
the Issuer may provide additional debt or equity financing to Schaeffler AG, Continental AG, Vitesco
AG or their respective subsidiaries. If the Issuer is unable or, due to restrictions under the terms of its
debt instruments (including the Notes, the Existing Issuer Notes and/or the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement), not permitted to provide such financing, the business or financial condition of
Schaeffler AG, Continental AG or Vitesco AG could suffer, which could adversely affect the value of
our investments in Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG and the ability of Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG to make distributions.

**_Membership of the same persons on several boards may result in conflicts of interest among the_**
**_Issuer, the Schaeffler Group, Continental AG and Vitesco AG._**

There is some overlap in personnel among the Issuer, the Schaeffler Group, Continental AG and
Vitesco AG (“Dual Mandates”), which is common practice in comparable corporate structures. Klaus
Rosenfeld, the Chief Executive Officer of Schaeffler AG, is also a member of the supervisory boards of
Continental AG and Vitesco AG. Furthermore, Georg F. W. Schaeffler, the chairman of Schaeffler AG’s
Supervisory Board is also represented on the supervisory boards of Continental AG and Vitesco AG.
Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann is also the deputy chairperson of Schaeffler AG’s Supervisory
Board. Prof. KR Ing. Siegfried Wolf, a member of the supervisory board of Schaeffler AG, is also
chairman of the supervisory board of Vitesco AG. Prof. Dr. Hans-Jörg Bullinger, a member of the
supervisory board of Schaeffler AG, is also a member of the supervisory board of Vitesco AG. Mr.
Schaeffler and Ms. Schaeffler-Thumann are also the ultimate owners of all voting shares of Schaeffler
AG and 46.0% of the total share capital of Continental AG and 49.9% of the total share capital of
Vitesco AG. In addition, Mr. Schaeffler, Ms. Schaeffler-Thumann and Mr. Rosenfeld are all members
of the management board (Geschäftsführung) of the Issuer.

It cannot be excluded that in some cases there may be a conflict of interest in engaging in and
structuring business relations among the Issuer, the Schaeffler Group, Continental AG and Vitesco
AG.

The German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and Corporate Governance Code (Deutscher
_Corporate Governance Kodex) contain certain provisions aimed at protecting companies from the_
negative effects of potential conflicts of interest in case of personnel overlap. Members of the board
of managing directors of a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), such as Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG and Vitesco AG, have a legal duty to act solely in the interests of their respective
companies. In the case of Dual Mandates, this duty can mean that members of the board of
managing directors are not permitted to vote on certain decisions in one or both of the companies.
Even though they are members of the supervisory board of Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG,
persons holding Dual Mandates are not allowed to make any decisions that are not in the interests of
the Schaeffler Group. Despite these regulations, we cannot exclude the possibility that in some cases
conflicts of interest may arise which are resolved to the detriment of any of the Schaeffler Group,


-----

Continental AG or Vitesco AG. In particular, it cannot be excluded that individuals involved in the
strategy of the Issuer who also hold positions as members of the board of managing directors and
supervisory board or other functions in the Schaeffler Group, Continental AG or Vitesco AG may act
in the interests of these companies to the detriment of the Issuer. The same holds true with regard
to the possible individual economic interests of such persons.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Any Collateral may be released or impaired without consent of the Note Holders, and under certain_**
**_circumstances the Notes could become unsecured and lose the benefit of all Collateral._**

The Indenture and the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement provide that in certain
circumstances all or part of the Collateral may be released without any consent of the Note Holders;
see “Description of the Notes—Security.” Among other circumstances, liens over assets forming part
of the Collateral will be automatically released under the Indenture, under certain circumstances,
including upon the release of any and all liens (other than permitted liens) over the relevant
Collateral securing other debt, including indebtedness under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement and the Existing Issuer Notes (which contain similar release provisions). Such release
could occur, for example, in connection with a refinancing, repayment or amendment of the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement. Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request of
the relevant grantor of collateral, obliged to release collateral if the realizable value of the collateral
is significantly higher than the value of the obligations secured by such collateral. As a result, the
Notes could become unsecured and lose the benefit of all of the Collateral without consent of the
Note Holders.

In addition, subject to certain conditions, additional debt will be permitted to share the Collateral on
a pro rata basis. In order to allow future debt to share the Collateral, the Indenture and the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement allow the security interests on the Collateral securing
the Notes to be amended and the Collateral to be released and retaken without the consent of the
Note Holders under certain circumstances, which would likely result in applicable hardening periods
to restart or to be extended. Subject to certain exceptions and conditions, the security documents
governing the security interests over the Collateral may be amended with the consent of an
Instructing Group (see “—Note Holders will be able to direct the enforcement of the Collateral only
_under certain limited circumstances”). As a result of any of the foregoing, the Collateral could be_
impaired without the consent of Note Holders.

**_The Collateral only includes certain assets of the Issuer, and the value of the Collateral may not be_**
**_sufficient to pay all or any of the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will initially comprise pledges over (i) 333,000,001 common shares
in Schaeffler AG (representing 66.6% of the voting shares (Stammaktien) and 50.0% plus one share of
the total share capital of Schaeffler AG), (ii) 48,742,194 common shares in Continental AG
(representing 24.4% of the total share capital of Continental AG), and (iii) 9,748,439 common shares
in Vitesco AG (representing 24.4% of the total share capital of Vitesco AG). The Collateral securing
the Notes will not include pledges over all of the capital stock in Vitesco AG, Continental AG or
Schaeffler AG held by the Issuer. None of the assets of the Schaeffler Group will be included in the
Collateral. All or part of the Collateral may be released without the consent of Note Holders under
certain circumstances (see “—Any Collateral may be released or impaired without consent of the
_Note Holders, and under certain circumstances the Notes could become unsecured and lose the_
_benefit of all Collateral”). If an event of default occurs and the Notes are accelerated, the Notes will_
rank equally with the holders of other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness with respect to
any excluded assets. To the extent the claims of Note Holders exceed the value of the assets securing
the Notes and other liabilities, claims related to any excluded assets will rank equally with the claims


-----

of the holders of any other unsecured indebtedness. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as
security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the Note Holders together with any
claims of the holders of any pari passu additional indebtedness (including the Existing Issuer Notes
and any obligations under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement), those claims, including claims
of the Note Holders, may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are
paid.

The shares of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG have experienced significant price
fluctuations in the past, including recently as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the war in Ukraine, and may experience such fluctuation in the future from time to time, which may
also be unrelated to the performance of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG. The
market price of these shares may fluctuate as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond
our control and may fall below the current market price. These factors include, but are not limited to,
the following:

  - market expectations for the financial performance of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or
Vitesco AG;

  - actual or anticipated fluctuations in the business, financial position or prospects of Schaeffler
AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG;

  - actual or anticipated changes in shareholders’ distributions by Schaeffler AG, Continental AG
and/or Vitesco AG;

  - actual or anticipated fluctuations in the general economic, financial or business conditions in
the countries in which Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG;

  - changes in the estimates of the financial results of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or
Vitesco AG by securities analysts or the failure to meet the estimates of the securities analysts;

  - actual or anticipated sales of blocks of shares of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco
AG in the market or short selling of such shares;

  - actual or anticipated speculative trading in the shares of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or
Vitesco AG;

  - actual or anticipated future issuances of shares of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or
Vitesco AG;

  - actual or anticipated changes in the automotive and industrial sector, including but not limited
to mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances, entrance of new competitors, or the
development or introduction of new products in the markets in which Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG;

  - changes to the regulatory environment or the commencement of legal or regulatory issues or
investigations;

  - announcements by Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG or any of its competitors
of major contracts or the loss of major customers;

  - departures of key personnel;

  - changes in or lack of the trading liquidity of the shares of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or
Vitesco AG;

  - volatility in the domestic or international stock markets;

  - the general condition of the global economy or financial system; and


-----

  - the risk factors mentioned in “—Risks related to our Business Operations and the Markets in
_which we operate.”_

The market price of the shares of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG may be adversely
affected by any of the preceding or other factors regardless of the actual operational results, financial
condition and financial performance of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco AG. Therefore,
we cannot make any predictions about the market price of the shares constituting Collateral.

In addition, the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that
include, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic
conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of
the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair
market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. In the event of
a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the proceeds from any sale or liquidation
of this Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes and other prior ranking
and pari passu claims referred to above.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, prior or junior ranking encumbrances
or liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-priority
security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date
the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the
Security Trustee to enforce such Collateral. Furthermore, the security interests can be affected by a
variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements,
statutory or contractual liens under applicable laws.

The Collateral will include pledges over a certain number of common shares in Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG and Vitesco AG owned by the Issuer. Due to the size of the aggregate amounts
outstanding secured by the Collateral and the high volatility and uncertainty regarding the value of
the shares of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG, the value of Collateral as well as the
ability of the Security Trustee to enforce such Collateral in a timely manner could be adversely
affected.

The enforcement of security interests by the Security Trustee will also be subject to practical
problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the
enforcement of security interest by the Security Trustee may require the completion of judicial
proceedings. There is no assurance that the Security Trustee will successfully complete such judicial
proceedings in a timely manner or that other practical problems relating to the foreclosure of
Collateral will be overcome by the Security Trustee at all or without a material delay. Accordingly, the
Security Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the
Collateral may significantly decrease.

The right of Note Holders to direct the enforcement of Collateral will be restricted by the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Note Holders will be able to direct the
_enforcement of the Collateral only under certain limited circumstances.”_

**_The Collateral might be challenged or voidable in insolvency proceedings._**

The Collateral may be voidable by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by
other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, if certain events or circumstances exist or
occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent or insolvency proceedings
are commenced at the time of, or within certain statutory time periods (“claw back periods”) after,
the grant. At each time, if the Collateral granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before


-----

the end of the respective claw back period, it may be declared void. To the extent that the creation of
the Collateral is voided, the Note Holders and the Security Trustee would lose the benefit of such
Collateral and would be creditors solely of the Issuer and would therefore benefit only from any
remaining Collateral and possibly a general quota paid to unsecured creditors of the Issuer as a result
of the insolvency proceedings. The Note Holders and the Security Trustee may also be required to
repay any amounts received with respect to the Collateral.

In order to effectively secure future indebtedness, including additional Notes, that is permitted by
the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement to share in the Collateral, it may be
necessary to create additional, junior-ranking security over the Collateral at the time such
Indebtedness is incurred. Any such new security as well as any security interests for future
Indebtedness arising under the existing security documents over the Collateral will likely be subject
to new claw back periods and, consequently, to potential insolvency challenges as described under
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.” Since the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement will provide that any_
proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral will be distributed on a pro rata basis among the Note
Holders, the holders of the Existing Issuer Notes, the lenders under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement, certain hedge counterparties and the holders of any future indebtedness that shares in
the Collateral and becomes subject to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement after
the Issue Date, a successful challenge of any new junior-ranking security or any security interest
arising for future indebtedness under the existing security documents would reduce the amount of
enforcement proceeds available for distribution to the secured creditors under the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, including the Note Holders.

In addition, in case the Issuer issues additional Notes with the same securities identification numbers
as the initial Notes issued on the Issue Date, including any Additional PIK Notes paid as PIK Interest,
an insolvency administrator may seek to challenge the enforceability of Collateral securing both the
additional Notes and the initial Notes issued on the Issue Date even if the claw back period with
respect to the Collateral securing the initial Notes has expired, based on the fact that the initial Notes
and the additional Notes are fungible and not distinguishable. Any such successful challenge would
further reduce the proceeds available to Note Holders.

A summary description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany is set out in “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and
its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens in the
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the
Security Trustee is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to
the Issue Date. The Issuer has limited obligations to assist the Security Trustee in perfecting the Note
Holders’ security interest in specified Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Trustee or the
Security Trustee for the Notes will monitor, or that the Issuer will inform such Trustee or Security
Trustee of, the future acquisition of property and rights that should constitute Collateral, and that
the necessary action will be taken to properly create and perfect the security interest in such afteracquired property and rights. The Security Trustee for the Notes has no obligation to monitor the
acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute Collateral or the creation or
perfection of any security interest. Such failure may result in such security interest being created in
such property or rights or in the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third
parties being adversely affected.


-----

**_The insolvency laws of Germany may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those of_**
**_another jurisdiction with which you are familiar and may preclude Note Holders from recovering_**
**_payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions
may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with
which you are familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition
interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency
laws. In the event that the Issuer experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. A brief description of certain aspects of insolvency
law in the EU and Germany is set forth under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors._**

As a potential investor in the Notes, you must determine the suitability of that investment in light of
your own circumstances. In particular, you should:

  - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the
merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum;

  - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of
your particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will
have on your overall investment portfolio;

  - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from your
currency;

  - understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behavior of any
relevant financial markets; and

  - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible scenarios for
economic, interest rate (including the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates
may adversely affect the value of the Notes) and other factors that may affect your investment
and your ability to bear the applicable risks.

**_The interests of the Issuer’s shareholders may be inconsistent with your interests._**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann and Georg F. W.
Schaeffler (together, the “Schaeffler Family”) ultimately own the entire equity of the Issuer. The
interests of the Schaeffler Family could conflict with your interests, particularly if the Issuer and/or its
subsidiaries encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay their debts when due. Affiliates of
the Schaeffler Family may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or
other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such
transactions might involve risks to you as a Note Holder. In addition, the Schaeffler Family or their
affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with us.

**_Despite their substantial level of indebtedness, the Issuer and the Schaeffler Group will still be able_**
**_to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated_**
**_with their substantial indebtedness._**

The Issuer and the Schaeffler Group may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future.
For example, under the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement, we have a €500 million


-----

term loan credit facility, of which we utilized €350 million on January 2, 2023 and expect to utilize the
remaining €150 million available thereunder in March 2023, and a €2.0 billion revolving credit facility
available to us, of which €55 million was utilized as of December 31, 2022, in the form of letters of
credit and, we also have the Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper Program of which €50 million (book
value: €50 million) were utilized as of December 31, 2022. In addition, under the Issuer Revolving
Facility, the Issuer has a €800 million revolving credit facility, of which €160 million were utilized as of
December 31, 2022. Although the Indenture, the indentures governing the Existing Issuer Notes, the
Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement and certain of the Schaeffler Group’s financing arrangements
contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number
of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of debt that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition to specified permitted debt, the
Issuer will be able to incur additional debt under the Indenture so long as on a pro forma basis the
Issuer loan-to-value ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is less than 1.0 to 2.5 and the combined
coverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is at least 2.0 to 1.0. Moreover, as the Indenture, the
indentures governing the Existing Issuer Notes and the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement do not
place any restrictions on the ability of Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt,
these entities are only subject to any restrictions contained under the terms of their respective
financing arrangements. See “—Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries
_under the Indenture and will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, will not_
_guarantee the Notes and will not provide any Collateral.”_

Furthermore, the Issuer may accrue PIK interest under the Notes and the Existing Issuer Notes, which
will increase the amount of the Issuer’s outstanding debt in the future. In addition, the Indenture, the
indentures governing the Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the
financing arrangements of the Schaeffler Group as well as the agreements governing debt incurred in
the future will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under
those agreements. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the risks associated with our
substantial indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will
increase.

**_Although the occurrence of specific change of control events will permit Note Holders to require_**
**_repurchase of the Notes, the Issuer may not be able to repurchase such Notes._**

Upon the occurrence of specific change of control events, the Note Holders will have the right to
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase all or part of the Notes then outstanding at a price equal to
101% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Issuer’s ability to
repurchase Notes upon such events will be limited by its access to funds at the time of the
repurchase and the terms of certain debt agreements, which agreements could restrict or prohibit
such a repurchase. Upon a change of control event, the Issuer and Schaeffler AG may be required to
immediately repay the outstanding principal, any accrued interest on and any other amounts owed
by them under one or more of their bank facilities and may be required to offer to repurchase certain
other debt instruments, including the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Existing Issuer
Notes and the credit facilities and debt securities of the Schaeffler Group. The source of funds for
these repayments would be the available cash or cash generated from other sources. For example,
certain agreements governing indebtedness of the Schaeffler Group contain provisions that may
prohibit the upstreaming of funds to the Issuer necessary to repurchase or repay the Notes upon a
change of control. If a change of control occurs at a time when Schaeffler Group companies are
prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer, Schaeffler Group companies may seek the consent of
the creditors under such indebtedness to allow the repurchase of the Notes or may attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. The Issuer may also require third-party
financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. The Issuer cannot
assure you that Schaeffler Group companies would be able to obtain the consent of their creditors to
provide funds to the Issuer or that the Issuer would be able to obtain such third-party financing or


-----

otherwise obtain sufficient funds upon a change of control on reasonable terms, or at all, to make
these repayments and any required repurchases of tendered Notes. Any failure by the Issuer to offer
or consummate an offer to purchase Notes could constitute a default under the Indenture, which
could, in turn, constitute a default under the Issuer’s other debt instruments, including the Existing
Issuer Notes and the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—
_Repurchase at the option of Holders—Change of Control.”_

**_The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you_**
**_protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger
or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate
events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not
constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description
_of the Notes—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not_
contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the
event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a phrase relating to the direct or
indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
properties or assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder to require the Issuer
to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less
than all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person
or group may be uncertain.

**_If the actual liquidity of the Issuer prior to an interest payment date or the liquidity projected for_**
**_the Issuer for a three-month period following an interest payment date falls below certain levels,_**
**_interest on the Notes may be paid in PIK Interest rather than cash._**

The Issuer will be required to pay interest on the Notes entirely in cash unless the conditions
described in this Offering Memorandum are satisfied, in which case the Issuer will be entitled to pay
interest, to the extent described herein, by either increasing the principal amount of the outstanding
Notes or by issuing Additional PIK Notes as PIK Interest. See “Description of the Notes—Interest.” In
addition, the ability of the Issuer to pay Cash Interest is dependent on the receipt of payments, if any,
it receives from Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and Vitesco AG (and any investments it may make in
the future). The Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and the indentures governing
the Existing Issuer Notes, as well as the Schaeffler Group’s financing arrangements, allow the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to utilize amounts that would otherwise be available to pay dividends to the Issuer for
other uses, and such uses would reduce the amount of cash available to pay dividends to the Issuer
in order for the Issuer to pay Cash Interest on the Notes. The terms of the Notes will not restrict any
of the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ ability to use its dividend payment capacity for such alternative uses. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes—Principal and maturity” and
“Description of the Notes—Interest.” In addition, the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement requires,
and future indebtedness of the Issuer may require, the Issuer to pay Cash Interest with respect to
these obligations, which will require the Issuer to use a certain portion of the dividend capacity for
these purposes. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Issuer will be required (or able) to make
Cash Interest payments on the Notes, and Note Holders could potentially receive no Cash Interest on
the Notes for interest periods other than the initial two and final periods. The payment of interest
through an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Notes or the issuance of new Notes
or any future debt providing for PIK interest, will increase the amount of the Issuer’s indebtedness


-----

and would increase the risks associated with the Issuer’s level of indebtedness. The Issuer cannot
assure you that the subsidiaries of the Issuer will be in a position to make payments to the Issuer that
would allow it to pay Cash Interest on the Notes.

**_Note Holders may be unable to enforce their rights in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws_**
**_violations._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany. Most of its respective officers and directors are
non-residents of the United States and most of their assets are located outside the United States. As
a result, it may not be possible for Note Holders to effect service of process within the United States
upon the Issuer to enforce against it judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for
payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, may not be enforceable, either in
whole or in part, in Germany. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_There is no active public trading market for the Notes and an active trading market for the Notes_**
**_may not develop._**

Although application has been made to admit the Notes to trading on the LuxSE’s Euro MTF Market,
there can be no assurance regarding the future development of a market for the Notes or the ability
of Note Holders to sell their Notes or the price at which Note Holders may be able to sell their Notes.
If such a market were to develop, the Notes could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than
the initial offering price depending on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, our operating
results, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions,
performance and prospects, as well as recommendations of securities analysts. The liquidity of, and
the trading market for, the Notes may also be adversely affected by a decline in the market for high
yield securities generally. Such a decline may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes
independently of our financial performance and prospects.

**_The transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Issuer is selling the Notes under exemptions from registration requirements under the Securities
Act or applicable U.S. state or foreign securities laws. None of the Notes have been registered under
the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws and we do not intend to file a registration
statement for the resale of any of the Notes after the Offering. Accordingly, the Notes may not be
offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state and foreign
securities laws, and Note Holders may be required to bear the cost of their investment in the Notes
until their maturity. The restrictions on transfer applicable to the Notes may impact your ability to
resell the Notes or may reduce the price you receive in doing so. By purchasing the Notes, you will be
deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements relating to these
transfer restrictions. It is the Note Holders’ obligation to ensure that their offers and sales or resales
of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See
“Important Information about this Offering Memorandum” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes will be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes because
none of the stated interest on the Notes will constitute “qualified stated interest.” As a result, U.S.
Holders (as defined below under “Taxation—U.S. Taxation”) will be required to include original issue


-----

discount in their gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues even though they may have not
received related cash payments. See “Taxation—U.S. Taxation.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. Such ratings
are limited in scope and may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure,
market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the
Notes, but rather reflect only the views of the rating agencies at the time the ratings are issued. An
explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained from the rating agencies. A credit
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not
reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the Notes.

The Notes offered in the Offering will have a non-investment grade rating on the issue date of the
Notes. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of
time or that a credit rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in the judgment of the credit rating agency, circumstances in the future so warrant. Even in
the absence of adverse developments, our ratings could be lowered or withdrawn if a credit rating
agency were to change existing methodologies or implement new methodologies for rating us. In
assigning ratings to the Notes, rating agencies typically also consider the ratings assigned by them to
the Issuer’s main holdings, particularly Schaeffler AG, and changes in such ratings may result in
changes to ratings of the Notes. Certain rating agencies are currently conducting their regular ratings
review of Schaeffler AG, and there can be no assurance that such review will not result in any
changes to the ratings, or changes in outlook, assigned to Schaeffler AG or the Notes. Moreover, we
may terminate or refrain from seeking credit ratings when we feel they do not appropriately reflect
our financial condition. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating
assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and
terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

Global conditions and production levels in the automotive and industrial sectors have been
significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and these impacts have led to downgrades in our
credit ratings. If market conditions worsen further, as a result of a resurgence of the COVID-19
pandemic, the effects of the war in Ukraine or the economic sanctions and export controls imposed
in response thereto, or otherwise, this could have negative effects on our liquidity and lead to a
further downgrade of our credit ratings (see “—Risks related to our Business Operations and the
_Markets in which we operate—As a global supplier to the automotive and industrial sectors we are_
_exposed to substantial risks associated with the performance of the global economy, political_
_uncertainty and the performance of the economy in the regions in which we operate”). Any such_
downgrade could have adverse effects on our options for obtaining funding as well as our financing
costs and interest expenses. A downgrade of our credit rating could also impact our liquidity position
if our suppliers change the terms of payment offered to us for this reason, for example, by requesting
payment in advance. These negative consequences could be exacerbated if credit insurers were to
further restrict coverage for our accounts payable. In addition, a downgrade could cause our
customers to extend their normal payment terms or even to terminate their business relationships
with us to engage other suppliers.

Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to fulfill its
obligations under the Notes or cause the market price and marketability of the Notes to decline.


-----

**_The Notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing system to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will be issued in fully registered global form. The Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule
144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary.

Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through
such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only
through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants.
Owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes in
registered form, except under the limited circumstances described in “Book-entry, Delivery and
_Form—Definitive Registered Notes.” So long as the Notes are held in global form, holders of Book-_
Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Global Notes. The common
depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their respective nominees, as applicable, will be
considered the sole holders of Global Notes.

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
interest and Additional Amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The relevant
Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to (i) the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, which will, in turn distribute such payments to participants in
accordance with its procedures. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the holders of Book-Entry Interests. Accordingly, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, on the procedures of the
participant through which you hold your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of
Notes under the Indenture governing the Notes.

Unlike the Note Holders themselves, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from Note
Holders. Instead, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you
have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. The
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote
on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture governing the Notes,
unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you
hold a Book-Entry Interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. The
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the
timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_Many of the covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the ratings of our_**
**_Notes._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the relevant Notes
receive a rating of BBB- or better from S&P and a rating of Baa3 or better from Moody’s and no
default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until one or both of
S&P and Moody’s withdraws such rating or downgrades the rating assigned to such Notes below such
rating, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain covenants—Suspension of covenants when Notes rated investment grade.”_

If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness
or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of Note


-----

Holders and would allow us to engage in certain transaction that would not have been permitted
while these covenants were in effect. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained. To the extent any suspended
covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended
would not result in an event of default under the Indenture on the basis that such actions would have
been prohibited by the covenant.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by
reference to a currency other than the euro, as the case may be, an investment in the Notes entails
foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value
of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns
because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the
euro against the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns could cause a
decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss
to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you
measure your investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign
exchange gains or losses from any investment in the Notes. See “Taxation—U.S. Taxation.”

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to assets with_**
**_sustainability characteristics._**

In connection with the Offering, the Issuer adopted the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework,
which refers to certain sustainability targets of the Schaeffler Group and which was reviewed by S&P
Global Ratings Europe Limited (the “Second Party Opinion Provider”), who provided the Second
Party Opinion. The Second Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to
the structure, market, or additional risk factors that may affect the value of the Notes. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and the Second Party Opinion are
not and shall not be deemed to be incorporated into and/or form part of this Offering Memorandum.
The Second Party Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is
only current as of the date it is released. A withdrawal of the Second Party Opinion may affect the
value of the Notes and/or may have consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to
invest in sustainability-linked assets. Neither the Issuer nor Schaeffler AG assumes any obligation or
responsibility to release any update or revision to the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework
and/or information to reflect events or circumstances after the date of publication of the
Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and, therefore, an update or a revision of the Second
Party Opinion may or may not be requested of the Second Party Opinion Provider or other providers
of second party opinions.

Moreover, the Second Party Opinion Provider and providers of similar opinions and certifications are
not currently subject to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight. Any such opinion or
certification is not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Initial Purchasers, the ESG Coordinator, any second party opinion provider or any other person to
buy, sell or hold the Notes. Holders of the Notes have no recourse against the Issuer, any of the Initial
Purchasers or the provider of any such opinion or certification for the contents of any such opinion or
certification, which is only current as at the date it was initially issued. None of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the ESG Coordinator, the Second Party Opinion Provider or any other person assumes
any obligation or responsibility to release any update or revision to the Second Party Opinion to
reflect events or circumstances after the date of publication thereof. Additionally, although a second
party opinion on the alignment of our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework with, inter alia, the
Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles 2020, as administered by ICMA, has been provided by the
Second Party Opinion Provider and the Notes are designated as “sustainability-linked notes,”


-----

investors should be aware that there is no commonly understood definition of this term, or what
constitutes an “ESG,” “green,” “social” or “sustainable” target, and that the Notes may lack certain
features contained in other similarly-designated debt securities. As a result, no assurance is or can be
given to investors by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the ESG Coordinator, the Second Party Opinion
Provider or any other person that the Notes will meet any or all investor expectations or that our
targets qualify as “ESG,” “green,” “social,” “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked.”

Prospective investors must determine for themselves the relevance of any such opinion or
certification and/or the information contained therein and/or the provider of such opinion or
certification for the purpose of any investment in the Notes. Any withdrawal of any such opinion or
certification or any such opinion or certification attesting that the Issuer or Schaeffler Group are not
complying in whole or in part with any matters for which such opinion or certification is opining on or
certifying on may have a material adverse effect on the value of the Notes and/or result in adverse
consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in securities to be used for a
particular purpose.

Furthermore, although the interest rate relating to the Notes is subject to upward adjustment in
certain circumstances specified in “Description of the Notes” such Notes may not satisfy an investor’s
requirements or any future legal or quasi legal standards for investment in assets with sustainability
characteristics. The Notes are not being marketed as “green bonds,” “social bonds” or “sustainability
bonds.” Therefore, the Issuer does not intend to allocate the net proceeds specifically to projects or
business activities meeting environmental or sustainability criteria, or be subject to any other
limitations associated with green bonds.

In addition, the interest rate adjustment in respect of the Notes depends on the Issuer’s definitions
and calculations of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions (“GHG Emissions”) that
may be inconsistent with investor requirements or expectations or other definitions relevant to GHG
Emissions. The interest rate adjustment provided may not adequately compensate the Noteholder
for any deterioration in the price of the Notes if the Schaeffler Group fails to meet the Sustainability
Performance Target.

If no Sustainability Report is published by Schaeffler AG, there might be no third-party analysis
possible in respect of the definitions or calculations of GHG Emissions or how such definitions relate
to any sustainability-related standards. There currently is no clearly defined definition (legal,
regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to, what constitutes a sustainable or
sustainability-linked or equivalently-labelled project or as to what precise attributes are required for
a particular project to be defined as sustainable or sustainability-linked (and, in addition, the
requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time).

As a result, no assurance or representation is or can be given to investors by the Issuer, the Trustee,
the Initial Purchasers, the ESG Coordinator or of any opinion of any third party (whether or not
solicited by us) that the Notes will meet any or all investor expectations or the targets with respect to
the Schaeffler Group qualifying as sustainable or sustainability-linked or that any other adverse
impacts will not occur in connection with the Issuer or the Schaeffler Group striving to achieve such
targets. Investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose
whatsoever of any opinion, report or certification of any third party in connection with the offering of
the Notes.

The calculation of GHG Emissions of the Schaeffler Group is based on internal calculations made by
Schaeffler AG based on broadly accepted standards and reported externally and confirmed by
Schaeffler AG’s auditors (or such other accountancy firm, environmental consultant or other thirdparty diligence provider appointed by Schaeffler AG from time to time). Any change to the calculation
methodology of the Sustainability Performance Goals or significant changes in data due to better
data accessibility or as a result of any acquisition, investment or disposal (as not prohibited under the
Indenture) may result in a change in the Baseline GHG Emissions, the Sustainability Performance


-----

Goals, including the Sustainability Performance Target applicable to the Notes and/or the
Sustainability Performance Levels. The standards and guidelines continue to be reviewed by expert
groups and include contributions from industry bodies, which may change going forward. The
occurrence of an event which may lead Schaeffler AG to recalculate the Baseline GHG Emissions, any
Sustainability Performance Goal, including the Sustainability Performance Target applicable to the
Notes and/or the Sustainability Performance Levels, which includes any change (i) to the calculation
methodology of GHG Emissions (including any change to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and
Reporting Standard), (ii) in data due to better data accessibility, or (iii) in the Schaeffler Group’s
perimeter (due to an acquisition, a merger, a disposal or an investment), which, individually or in
aggregate, has an impact on the levels of the GHG Emissions of 5% or more (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer) and may cause a recalibration by the Issuer, on a unilateral basis, acting in good
faith as detailed further in “Description of the Notes—Interest—Sustainability Performance Target
_Step-Up—Sustainability Adjustments.”_

Although the Sustainability Performance Target is tied to a 75% reduction of Schaeffler Group’s GHG
Emissions by December 31, 2025, there can be no assurance of the extent to which the Schaeffler
Group will be successful in doing so.

Neither the Issuer nor Schaeffler AG have entered into any commitment or given any warranty that
Schaeffler AG will achieve the Sustainability Performance Target. If Schaeffler AG fails to achieve the
Sustainability Performance Target or Sustainability Performance Levels relevant for the Notes, the
rights of any Noteholder will be limited to the interest rate or redemption price adjustment,
respectively, all as described herein.

In addition, there can be no assurance that any future investments the Schaeffler Group makes in
furtherance of the target will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal
standards regarding sustainability performance, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect
environmental, sustainability or social impact. Adverse environmental or social impacts may occur
during the design, construction and operation of any investments that the Schaeffler Group makes in
furtherance of the target.

In addition, although the redemption prices payable upon certain optional redemptions of the Notes
will be adjusted as described under “Description of the Notes” under certain circumstances if certain
Sustainability Performance Levels are not achieved, such adjustment will not apply in connection
with all optional redemptions and will not apply in connection with mandatory redemptions or
repurchases, such as in connection with a change of control offer or an asset disposition offer or,
upon an acceleration of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes.”

Other than an upward adjustment in the respective interest rate relating the Notes and adjustments
in redemption prices in case of certain optional redemptions as described under “Description of the
_Notes,” there are no penalties or requirements to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the Indenture_
associated with failing to maintain the levels set by our Sustainability Performance Target, by failing
to meet any future sustainability targets, to deliver a Sustainability Compliance Certificate or to
publish that the Schaeffler Group has achieved the Sustainability Performance Target. See
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Even if we meet the initial Sustainability Performance Goals, there can be no assurance that we will_**
**_continue to meet our Sustainability Performance Goals thereafter. There will be limited_**
**_consequences under the Indenture for our failure to maintain the Sustainability Performance Goals._**

Even if we meet our initial Sustainability Performance Goals, there can be no assurance that we will
continue to maintain the levels set by the Sustainability Performance Goals in the future. In addition,
we may not be successful in continuing to improve our sustainability metrics in line with our longerterm sustainability targets as set out in our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework or we may
meet such targets later than anticipated. Other than an upward adjustment in the interest rate


-----

relating to the Notes and adjustments in redemption prices in case of certain optional redemptions
as described under “Description of the Notes,” there are no penalties or requirements to repurchase
or redeem the Notes in the Indenture associated with failing to maintain the levels set by our
Sustainability Performance Goals, by failing to meet any future sustainability targets, to deliver a
Sustainability Compliance Certificate or to publish that the Schaeffler Group has achieved the
relevant Sustainability Performance Goal.

## Use of Proceeds

The Issuer intends to use the gross proceeds from the Offering, together with cash at banks, (i) to
redeem (the “Issuer Notes Redemption”) €500 million in principal amount of the Existing 2025 Euro
Notes (the “Redeemed Issuer Notes”) on or about May 15, 2023, including the payment of accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, up until the applicable redemption date and (ii) to pay fees and expenses
related to the Offering and the Issuer Notes Redemption.

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will amount to €500 million.

The following table sets forth the expected sources and uses of funds (pro forma) in connection with
the Refinancing (all amounts shown are principal amounts). See “Summary—The Refinancing.”

(1) As adjusted cash at banks reflects the sources and uses of cash in connection with the Refinancing, as described under “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

(2) As of December 31, 2022, €160 million were drawn under the Issuer Revolving Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Indebtedness of the Issuer—Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement.”_

(3) The actual amount reflects the euro-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Issuer Notes, including the Redeemed
Issuer Notes. The as adjusted amount reflects the euro-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Issuer Notes
(excluding the Redeemed Issuer Notes). For presentational purposes, the Existing Issuer Notes denominated in U.S. dollar have been
converted into euro at the exchange rate of $1.0666 to €1.00 as of December 31, 2022. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(4) Financial debt excludes the €550 million subordinated shareholder loan granted by IHO Beteiligung to the Issuer in 2021. See “Certain
_Relationships and Related party Transactions—Transactions of the Issuer—Subordinated Shareholder Loan.”_

(5) For this illustration, we have assumed that transaction costs related to the Offering (estimated at €8 million) and the derecognition of
call options embedded in the Redeemed Issuer Notes (€0 million) are not amortized and have thus deducted these amounts from
shareholders’ equity. In addition, we have assumed that deferred income related to the Redeemed Issuer Notes (€1 million) is released
and have thus added to shareholders’ equity.

**_Income from Equity Investments_**

Income from equity investments consists of dividends and other distributions received from the
Issuer’s investments in Schaeffler AG and Continental AG and in 2021 dividends received from its 25%
interest in P A R A V A N GmbH (which the Issuer acquired in 2019 and sold in 2022). In the future,
income from equity investments may also include dividends and distributions, if any, received from
Vitesco AG, which was spun off from Continental AG in September 2021.

Income from equity investments increased from €120 million in 2021 by €283 million, or 235.1%, to
€403 million in 2022. Income from equity investments in 2021 consisted of Schaeffler AG dividends
declared at the annual general meeting of Schaeffler AG in 2021 (€120 million) and dividends of
€0.4 million received from P A R A V A N GmbH. Income from equity investments in 2022 consisted of
Schaeffler AG dividends declared at the annual general meeting of Schaeffler AG in 2022 (€245
million) and Continental AG dividends declared at the annual general meeting of Continental AG in
2022 (€158 million). The Issuer did not receive dividends from P A R A V A N GmbH in 2022 (the Issuer
sold its interest in P A R A V A N GmbH in 2022).

**_Interest and Similar Expenses / Income_**

Interest and similar expenses consist mainly of interest and similar expenses incurred under the
Existing Issuer Notes and the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement.

In 2021 and 2022, interest expense also includes interest expense incurred under the subordinated
shareholder loan granted by IHO Beteiligung to the Issuer in 2021 in connection with a declaration of
a dividend by the Issuer; at the Issuer’s sole discretion, interest on the loan is either payable in cash
or capitalized. Other interest and similar income includes interest and similar income from plan
assets related to the Issuer’s pension obligations, tax reimbursements and release of deferred
income.

Interest and similar expenses increased from €167 million in 2021 by €23 million, or 13.8%, to €190
million in 2022. The increase in interest and similar expenses in 2022 was mainly due to increased
interest expenses under the Existing Dollar Notes (€10 million) as a result of the fluctuations in the
value of the U.S. Dollar, as well as non-cash expenses related to a higher decrease in fair values of
bifurcated prepayment options (€17 million). Interest and similar expenses in 2021 were mainly
related to interest accruing on the Existing Issuer Notes as well as drawings under the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the Issuer’s term loan facility that was repaid in full and
terminated in February 2021. Interest expenses related to the subordinated shareholder loan
granted by IHO Beteiligung to the Issuer and amounted to €6 million in 2022 and €3 million in 2021.

Other interest and similar income increased from €4 million in 2021 to €10 million in 2022, primarily
due to net interest and similar income from plan assets of €6 million after netting €1 million of
interest expense related to the Issuer’s pension obligations.

**_General Administrative Expenses_**

General administrative expenses primarily consist of expenses for personal costs and purchased
services.

General administrative expenses increased from €1 million in 2021 by €7 million to €8 million in
2022. This increase was largely due to higher expenses related to the Issuer’s pension obligations (€4
million) and higher legal expenses (€3 million).


-----

**_Other Operating Income/Expenses_**

Other operating income/expenses primarily relate to exchange rate gains and losses realized in
connection with currency swaps.

The Issuer recorded other operating income of €16 million in 2021 and of €27 million in 2022. This
increase was largely due to higher currency exchange rate gains from currency swaps. The Issuer
recorded other operating expenses of €1 million in 2021 and of €3 million in 2022. This increase was
largely due to the loss from the sale of the Issuer’s interest in P A R A V A N GmbH in 2022, as the
interest was sold below book value.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income tax income/(expense) consists of current and deferred taxes for corporate income and trade
tax.

In 2021, the Issuer recorded income tax income of €2 million. Income tax expenses amounted to
€3 million in 2022. This change was largely the result of an increase in current tax expenses of €5
million and a decrease in tax refunds of €3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in
deferred tax income of €4 million.

**_Other Taxes_**

Income from other taxes increased from €0 million in 2021 to €1 million in 2022. This change was
mainly due to higher tax refunds.

**_Net Income/(loss) for the year_**

Net income/loss largely consists of income from equity investments in Schaeffler AG and Continental
AG plus other operating income less net interest expense on financial debt, general administrative
expenses and income taxes.

In 2021, the Issuer recorded a net loss of €26 million. Net income for the year 2022 amounted to
€237 million. The change was primarily related to an increase of income from equity investments by
€283 million from 2021 to 2022.

**_Income from Equity Investments_**

Income from equity investments decreased from €436 million in 2020 by €316 million, or 72.4%, to
€120 million in 2021. Income from equity investments in 2020 consisted solely of Schaeffler AG
dividends declared at the annual general meeting of Schaeffler AG in 2020 (€220 million) and
Continental AG dividends declared at the annual general meeting of Continental AG in 2020 (€216


-----

million). Income from equity investments in 2021 consisted of Schaeffler AG dividends declared at
the annual general meeting of Schaeffler AG in 2021 (€120 million) and dividends of €0.4 million
received from P A R A V A N GmbH. In 2021, there were no dividends declared by Continental AG for
2020.

**_Interest and Similar Expenses / Income_**

In 2021, interest expense also includes interest expense incurred under the subordinated
shareholder loan granted by IHO Beteiligung to the Issuer in 2021 in connection with a declaration of
a dividend by the Issuer; at the Issuer’s sole discretion, interest on the loan is either payable in cash
or capitalized. Other interest and similar income includes interest income from tax reimbursements,
release of deferred income and amortization of original issue discounts.

Interest and similar expenses decreased from €168 million in 2020 by €1 million, or 0.2%, to €167
million in 2021. Interest expenses in 2020 and 2021 were mainly related to interest accruing on the
Existing Issuer Notes as well as drawings under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the
Issuer’s term loan facility that was repaid in full and terminated in February 2021 (the term loan
facility was reduced from €600 million to €400 million in July 2020). Interest expenses related to the
subordinated shareholder loan granted by IHO Beteiligung to the Issuer amounted to €3 million in
2021.

Other interest and similar income increased from €2 million in 2020 to €4 million in 2021, primarily
due to interest income from tax reimbursements.

**_General Administrative Expenses_**

General administrative expenses decreased from €3 million in 2020 by €2 million to €1 million in
2021. This decrease was largely due to lower legal expenses.

**_Other Operating Income/Expenses_**

The Issuer recorded other operating income of €20 million in 2020 and of €16 million in 2021. This
decrease was largely due to lower currency exchange rate gains from currency swaps. The Issuer
recorded other operating expenses of €0 million in 2020 and of €1 million in 2021. This increase was
largely due to higher exchange rate losses.

**_Income from Other Securities and Long-term Loans Receivable_**

Income from other securities and long-term loans receivable decreased from €4 million in 2020 to €0
million in 2021. Income from other securities and long term loans receivable in 2020 was related to
interest income on an €880 million upstream loan to the Issuer’s shareholder, IHO Beteiligung, which
the Issuer provided to IHO Beteiligung in connection with a comprehensive refinancing in 2016. The
upstream loan was terminated in March 2020 by way of set-off against a dividend declared by the
Issuer.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income tax expenses amounted to €2 million in 2020. In 2021, the Issuer recorded income tax
income of €2 million. This change was largely the result of a decrease in deferred tax expenses by €2
million and an increase in tax refunds of €1 million in 2021.

**_Other Taxes_**

Income from other taxes decreased from €2 million in 2020 to €0 million in 2021. This change was
mainly due to lower refunds of other taxes in 2021.


-----

**_Net Income/(loss) for the year_**

Net income for the year 2020 amounted to €291 million. In 2021, the Issuer recorded a net loss of
€26 million. The change was primarily related to a decrease of income from equity investments by
€316 million from 2020 to 2021.

### Liquidity 

For 2020, 2021 and 2022, our principal source of liquidity was cash from dividends received. The
table below shows how our liquidity changed over the relevant periods indicated by cash inflows and
outflows. The figures are derived from the Issuer’s accounting records.

Income taxes received ................................................................................................................ 0 0 5

Income taxes paid ....................................................................................................................... 4 14 3

**_Cash Flows_**

_Cash dividends_

Cash dividends received during the past three years consist of dividends received from Schaeffler AG,
Continental AG and P A R A V A N GmbH (the Issuer acquired its 25% interest in P A R A V A N GmbH
in 2019 and sold it in 2022).

Cash dividends received in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were €436 million, €120 million and €362 million,
respectively, and consisted of dividends received from Schaeffler AG (in all three years) and
Continental AG (in 2020 and 2022), as well as dividends of €0.4 million received from P A R A V A N
GmbH in 2021. The cash dividend from Continental AG in 2022 (€117 million) was received net of a
withholding tax of €42 million which is expected to be credited against the corporate income tax
liability for 2022, and to the extent exceeding corporate income tax liability, it is expected to be
reimbursed in 2023. Continental AG did not pay cash dividends in 2021 and Vitesco AG has not paid
any dividends since its spin-off from Continental AG in 2021.

We did not pay cash dividends to IHO Beteiligung in 2020, 2021 or 2022. Although we declared a
dividend of €880 million in 2020, which was paid in kind by way of set-off against termination of a
€880 million upstream loan to IHO Beteiligung, and of €550 million in 2021, which was set off against
a subordinated shareholder loan granted by IHO Beteiligung to the Issuer, neither dividend resulted
in a cash outflow.

_Principal Payments On/From Financial Debt_

Our financial debt prior to the Refinancing consisted mainly of drawings under the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement, the Issuer’s term loan facility (until February 2021) and the Existing Issuer Notes
outstanding during the relevant period. In addition, in 2021 IHO Beteiligung granted a subordinated
shareholder loan in the principal amount of €550 million to the Issuer. Interest on the loan is payable
either in cash or capitalized (by increasing the principal amount of the loan), in the Issuer’s sole
discretion. See “Certain Relationships and Related party Transactions—Transactions of the Issuer—
_Subordinated Shareholder Loan.”_


-----

In September 2022, we repaid €100 million of the Issuer Revolving Facility, reducing the outstanding
amount to €160 million. We did not make any principal payments in respect of the Existing Issuer
Notes in that year.

In February 2021, we repaid in full the €400 million then outstanding under our term loan facility and
terminated that facility. In 2021, we made net repayments of €140 million under the Issuer Revolving
Facility. We did not make any principal payments in respect of the Existing Issuer Notes in that year.

In 2020, we reduced drawings under our term loan facility from €600 million to €400 million. We did
not make any drawings or repayments under the Issuer Revolving Facility and principal payments in
respect of the Existing Issuer Notes in that year.

_Interest_

Interest paid primarily consists of interest payments on the Existing Issuer Notes and borrowings
under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement and, until February 2021, drawings under a term
loan facility (repaid in full and terminated in February 2021) net of payments received under crosscurrency swaps related to the Existing Issuer Notes. To the extent the Issuer elects to pay interest in
cash, as it did in 2022, interest paid also includes interest on the subordinated shareholder loan
granted by IHO Beteiligung to the Issuer. Interest received primarily relates to interest we received
under a €880 million upstream loan to IHO Beteiligung, which was terminated on March 30, 2020 by
way of set-off of the loan receivable against a dividend-in-kind.

Interest paid in 2020, 2021 and 2022 amounted to €145 million, €141 million and €143 million,
respectively, of which €5 million related to the subordinated shareholder loan. During these periods,
we received interest payments of €16 million, €0 million and €0 million, respectively.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes received consist of reimbursement of corporate income and trade tax prepayments.
Income taxes paid consists of payments and prepayments for corporate income and trade tax.

In 2020 and 2021, net income taxes paid amounted to €4 million and €14 million, respectively. In
2022, net income taxes received amounted to €3 million.

### Liabilities

**_Financial Debt_**

As of December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer’s
financial debt would have amounted to €3,476 million, which primarily consists of the Notes offered
in the Offering, the Existing Issuer Notes (excluding the Redeemed Issuer Notes) and drawings under
the Issuer Revolving Facility. See “Summary—The Refinancing,” “Summary—Summary Financial
_Information—Pro Forma Financial Information,” “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”_

_Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement_

The Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement provides for a €800 million Issuer Revolving Facility, of
which €160 million were drawn as of December 31, 2022.

The Issuer Revolving Facility is secured by the same collateral that will secure the Notes and that
secures the Existing Issuer Notes on a pari passu basis. Up to €50 million of the Issuer Revolving
Facility are available for drawing, in the form of ancillary facilities, on behalf and for the account of
the Issuer, by Atesteo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IHO Holding GmbH & Co. KG, an indirect
shareholder of the Issuer, which were unutilized as of December 31, 2022.

PIK toggle notes due 2029, each issued under an indenture dated June 6, 2019. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Issuer—Existing Issuer Notes.”_

The Issuer intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering, together with cash at banks, to redeem
€500 million in principal amount of the Existing 2025 Euro Notes (the “Redeemed Issuer Notes”). The
Issuer expects to redeem the Redeemed Issuer Notes on or about May 15, 2023. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

**_Provisions_**

_Tax Provisions_

Tax provisions as of December 31, 2022 amounted to €8 million and primarily relate to the potential
impact of tax audits.

_Provisions for Pensions and Similar Liabilities_

Provisions for pensions and similar liabilities as of December 31, 2022 of €7 million primarily relate to
defined benefit obligations and deferred compensation. See “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax

** Effective as of January 1, 2022, we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022). As a result, starting in 2022, we began reporting earnings before financial result and income taxes (EBIT) to
include income (loss) from equity-accounted investees. Figures for 2021 have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. EBIT
and related figures for 2020 have not been adjusted retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully comparable to the figures for
subsequent periods. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and

### Selected Segment Information

_Schaeffler Group reports financial information based on the following three Divisions: Automotive_
_Technologies, Automotive Aftermarket and Industrial._

_The allocation of customers to segments is reviewed at least annually and adjusted where necessary._
_In each of 2020, 2021 and 2022, such review resulted in the re-allocation of customers between_
_Divisions. To ensure that segment information is comparable between subsequent periods,_
_comparative information for the respective prior period included in the Audited Consolidated Financial_
_Statements for a period has been adjusted using the customer allocation structure from such period._

_Except as otherwise indicated, financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020_

## Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group

_The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the_
_Schaeffler Group are derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been_
_prepared in accordance with IFRS and which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum,_
_and from Schaeffler Group’s internal accounting system. Except as the context otherwise indicates,_
_when discussing historical results of operations in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group,” “Schaeffler Group,” “we,”_
_“us,” “our” and other similar terms are generally used to refer to the business of Schaeffler AG and its_
_subsidiaries._

_Where financial data is labeled “audited,” this means that such data has been taken from the Audited_
_Consolidated Financial Statements. The label “unaudited” is to indicate financial data that has not_
_been taken from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements but has been taken or derived from_
_the internal reporting system of the Schaeffler Group or is based on calculations of figures of the_
_abovementioned sources._

_Prospective investors should read the following discussion together with the Audited Consolidated_
_Financial Statements (including the respective notes thereto). The following discussion should also be_
_read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and “Selected Financial_
_Information of the Schaeffler Group.” Some of the statements contained below relate to future_
_revenue, costs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and financial condition and include forward-looking_
_statements. Because such statements involve inherent uncertainties, actual results may differ_
_materially from the results expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. A discussion_
_of such uncertainties and related risks can be found in “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk_
_Factors.”_

_The Issuer holds 75.1% of Schaeffler AG’s share capital (representing 100% of the voting rights), with_
_the remaining 24.9% held by public investors. The consolidated financial information of Schaeffler AG_
_does not include the financial results of the Issuer, most notably with respect to its 36.0% stake in the_
_share capital of Continental AG and 39.9% stake in the share capital of Vitesco AG. As of the Issue_
_Date, Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer under the_
_Indenture and will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, will not guarantee the_
_Notes and will not provide any Collateral. As a consequence, Note Holders will have no recourse to_
_any Unrestricted Subsidiary, its assets or its properties if there is an event of default under the_
_Indenture. Access by the Issuer to the cash flow generated by Unrestricted Subsidiaries, including_
_Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries, is limited to amounts actually distributed to the Issuer as dividends_
_or other distributions. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our Financing—The Issuer depends on_
_dividend payments from its investments to meet its debt service obligations.” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks related to the Notes and our Structure—Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries under the Indenture and will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture,_
_will not guarantee the Notes and will not provide any Collateral.” Prospective investors should_
_therefore read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the_
_Issuer included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and with the section entitled “Certain_
_Financial Information of the Issuer.”_

### Overview

We develop and manufacture high-precision components, systems and services for powertrains and
chassis, as well as rolling and plain bearing solutions for various industry applications. This includes
innovative and sustainable technologies for hybrid, electric and combustion-engine powered
vehicles. Our offering comprises solutions for automated and autonomous driving, components and
systems for rotary and linear motion, as well as services, maintenance products and monitoring
systems for a wide range of industrial applications. Our portfolio also includes OEM-quality repair
solutions and associated supporting services for the global automotive aftermarket.

We are one of the largest family-controlled technology companies in the world, with approximately
83,000 employees and a network of production and manufacturing locations, R&D facilities and
distribution companies in approximately 200 locations in over 50 countries (as of December 31,
2022). Our 76 plants form the foundation of our operations.

In 2022, we had consolidated revenues of €15.8 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of €2.0 billion. For an
explanation of the components of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted
EBITDA, see “Summary Financial Information—Other Financial and Operating Data—Summary
_Financial Information of Schaeffler AG (IFRS)—Schaeffler AG.” We have a large presence in a number_
of growth markets, such as the Americas, China and the rest of Asia. We believe that we benefit from
our advanced technology platform, high product quality, long-standing and diversified customer
relationships, broad distribution channels, global production footprint and extensive product,
systems solutions and service offering.

We report financial information by based on the following three Divisions: Automotive Technologies,
Automotive Aftermarket and Industrial.

**_Automotive Technologies Division: Our Automotive Technologies Division partners with the global_**
automotive industry in developing and manufacturing components and system solutions for electric
and hybrid powertrains and fuel cell powertrains, as well as for internal combustion engines and
chassis systems. The Division also offers a wide range of rolling bearings that is largely powertrainagnostic. Our Automotive Technologies Division accounted for 60.1% of our consolidated revenue
and 27.9% of our Adjusted EBIT in 2022; in 2022, the Automotive Technologies Division recorded
Adjusted EBIT of €292 million. Until December 31, 2021, our Automotive Technologies Division
comprised four business divisions (“BDs”) with a distinctive product and service portfolio: (i) EMobility, (ii) Engine Systems, (iii) Transmission Systems and (iv) Chassis Systems. As from January 1,
2022, we have reorganized our Automotive Technologies Division’s BDs to include: (i) E-Mobility, (ii)
Engine Systems & Transmission Systems, (iii) Bearings, and (iv) Chassis Systems, which accounted for
approximately 14.2%, 54.2%, 27.6% and 3.9%, respectively, of the Automotive Technologies
Division’s revenue during 2022. See “Business—Our Divisions—Automotive Technologies Division.”
Discussions and figures in this section refer to the previous BDs with regard to financial figures for
2020 and refer to the new BDs with regard to financial figures for 2021 and 2022, except under “—
_Results of Operations—Comparison of 2020 with 2021,” where the discussions and figures refer to_
the previous BDs for comparability reasons.

**_Automotive Aftermarket Division: Our Automotive Aftermarket Division complements the_**
Automotive Technologies Division with an extensive aftermarket offering, which includes the
distribution of spare parts and services to customers globally. The Automotive Aftermarket Division
uses two primary distribution channels to sell its products and services to customers, the original
equipment service (“OES”), which supplies original spare parts to automobile OEMs for their branded
repair shops, and the open (independent) spare parts market or independent aftermarket (“IAM”),
which supplies components and repair solutions and services to a global network of independent
parts distributors, which supply workshops that are not affiliated with any particular automobile
OEM. A considerable portion of IAM’s sales market comprises of distributors organized in trade


-----

cooperatives. Our Automotive Aftermarket Division accounted for 12.9% of our consolidated revenue
and 24.4% of Adjusted EBIT in 2022; in 2022, the Automotive Aftermarket Division recorded Adjusted
EBIT of €255 million.

**_Industrial Division: The Industrial Division develops and manufactures components and systems for_**
rotary and linear movements as well as services such as maintenance products and monitoring
systems for customers in a variety of different industrial sectors, which we group into eight sector
clusters within four market clusters: renewables (wind), transportation and mobility (aerospace, rail,
offroad and two-wheelers), machinery and materials (raw materials and power transmission) and
industrial automation (industrial automation). The Industrial Division is also developing new products
and solutions for the hydrogen economy. In addition, our Industrial Distribution unit manages the
distribution portion of the business. The Industrial Division accounted for 27.0% of our consolidated
revenue and 47.7% of our Adjusted EBIT in 2022; in 2022, the Industrial Division recorded Adjusted
EBIT of €499 million.

Geographically, we manage our Divisions and businesses based on four regions, Europe (Germany,
Western Europe, Middle East & Africa, Central & Eastern Europe), the Americas (the United States &
Canada, Mexico, South America), Greater China (including Mainland China, and also Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao) and Asia/Pacific (South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia and India).

### Key Factors affecting Results of Operations 

Our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity have been influenced in the periods
discussed in this Offering Memorandum by the following events, facts, developments and market
characteristics. We believe that these factors have influenced and are likely to continue to influence
our operations in the future.

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue development is dependent on economic developments in the automotive and the
industrial sectors globally and was particularly impacted in recent years by the COVID-19 pandemic,
the war in Ukraine and inflationary trends. Slower economic growth began in 2019 and was further
exacerbated when, in the spring of 2020, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide
health and economic crisis, which heavily affected the automotive industry and all sectors of the
economy. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our revenues and profitability in
2020, particularly in the first half of the year, and required us to recognize an impairment of €249
million on the goodwill of the Automotive Technologies Division in the first quarter of 2020. In the
second half of 2020, global economic recovery began to emerge and broadly continued throughout
2021, although it slowed in the fourth quarter of 2021. In 2021, our results of operations were not as
significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as in 2020, as market demand recovered.
Vaccinations and the implementation of fiscal and monetary policies further bolstered our results
and contrasted with the impact of supply chain disruptions, new COVID-19 variants, and rising
commodity and energy prices. However, certain side effects of the market recovery, particularly price
increases of raw materials, such as steel, of energy, supply chain disruptions, and the semiconductor
shortage, which negatively affected vehicle production and therefore demand for our products, had
an adverse impact on our revenues and margins, particularly in the second half of the year.

In 2022, the global economic recovery slowed again with the start of the war in Ukraine, which had a
significant impact on the economic environment as well as our business and our customers’
businesses. Our revenues attributable to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine declined significantly in 2022
and amounted to approximately €32 million (€122 million in 2021), €2 million (€16 million in 2021)
and €17 million (€28 million in 2021), respectively. We reduced production at our plant in Ulyanovsk,
Russia (98 employees in Russia) to the minimum possible in order to continue to meet our
contractual delivery obligations, and ceased the operations of our Automotive Aftermarket and


-----

Industrial Divisions in Russia. We had also sourced certain raw materials, such as steel, from sources
in Russia, which we discontinued after the outbreak of the war, and had utilized shipping routes
between Europe and China that crossed through Russia, which we have re-routed. In addition, in
December 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our two Russian subsidiaries for a sale price of
€10 million. The agreed disposal, which is subject to the approval of Russian authorities, resulted in
an impairment of €12 million in 2022. In Ukraine, though our sales office in Kyiv (six employees in
Ukraine) was initially closed, our operations in Ukraine have resumed. While our direct exposure to
Russia, Belarus and Ukraine has been relatively limited, we will continue to monitor the impacts of
the war in Ukraine on macroeconomic conditions and continually assess the effect these matters may
have on our businesses and compliance obligations. For more information regarding the current and
potential impact of the war in Ukraine on our operations, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to our
_Business Operations and the Markets in which we operate—As a global supplier to the automotive_
_and industrial sectors we are exposed to substantial risks associated with the performance of the_
_global economy, political uncertainty and the performance of the economy in the regions in which we_
_operate.”_

The war in Ukraine and the related sanctions and counter-sanctions worsened the economic
environment that was already weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic, affected trade, resulted in
additional disruptions to global supply chains, significant upward pressure on commodity prices and
led to an energy crisis, in particular in Europe, where imports of Russian natural gas were significantly
reduced. In addition, the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, in particular from March to
May of 2022, resulted in renewed lockdowns and additional pressure on global supply chains.
Inflation also continued to rise during 2022 and resulted in central banks enacting measures,
including raising interest rates, seeking to curtail inflation. While the direct impact of these events on
our business activities was limited, these events negatively affected vehicle production and therefore
demand for our products and had an adverse impact on our revenues and margins, particularly in the
first half of 2022. In contrast to the global economic recovery seen in 2021, global GDP growth
declined steadily in 2022, particularly in the fourth quarter.

Global GDP increased by 3.2% in 2022 (Source: Oxford Economics, January 2023), and global
automotive production increased by 6.2% from 2021 to 2022, despite a modest increase of 0.6% in
Europe, as production increased by 9.3% in the Americas, 6.2% in Greater China and 9.0% in
Asia/Pacific (Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light Vehicle Production Forecast
(Base), January 2023], regions reflect the regional structure of the Schaeffler Group).

In this context, the situation in each of the Schaeffler Group’s regions was as follows: GDP in the
Europe region increased by approximately 2.9% in 2022 as compared to 2021, while economic output
in the Americas region increased by approximately 2.7%. In the Greater China region, GDP rose by
approximately 2.6% in 2022, which was below the prior year level, and the Asia/Pacific region’s
economic output rose by approximately 4.8% in 2022, each as compared to 2021 (Source: Oxford
Economics, January 2023).

_Developments in the Global Automotive Market_

We are a main partner and supplier to the global automotive industry and are therefore highly
dependent on developments in the global automotive market. Our Automotive Technologies
Division’s revenue is primarily affected by global automobile production, which in turn is impacted by
factors influencing consumer demand for new passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The
Automotive Technologies Division is indirectly affected by factors such as unemployment, interest
rates (and, most generally, overall monetary and fiscal policy), inflation, gasoline prices and
consumer confidence. In addition, the Automotive Technologies Division is indirectly impacted by
factors such as the levels of international trade and the availability of vehicle financing, as these
factors affect the demand for commercial vehicles in particular. In 2020, and, to a lesser extent, in
2021, our Automotive Technologies Division’s revenue was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,


-----

which posed significant challenges to the automotive sector overall and caused automobile
production to decrease by approximately 16.1% during 2020 (Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P
Global Mobility Light Vehicle Production Forecast (Base), February 2022]), in contrast to growth of
3.5% during 2021 and 6.2% in 2022 (Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light Vehicle
Production Forecast (Base), January 2023]). In 2022, automobile production declined in the first half
of the year and recovered to double-digit growth in the second half of the year (Source: S&P Global
Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light Vehicle Production Forecast (Base), January 2023]). Despite the
positive trend in global automobile production, our Automotive Technologies Division’s revenue was
affected by the challenging sector environment. These challenges included sustained semiconductor
shortages that led to high production losses, the war in Ukraine that caused a slump in production in
Russia and a shortage of raw materials from Ukraine that caused production disruptions in Europe,
and the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, in particular from March to May of 2022,
that significantly disrupted production in China and in Japan due to supply chain disruptions. In
addition to those supply challenges, rising inflation weakened consumer demand in 2022.

Supply chain disruptions, particularly the global semiconductor shortage, have significantly impacted
the automotive sector. After dropping considerably due to COVID-19, demand for passenger cars
rebounded in the third quarter of 2020 and has continued, and in turn, demand for semiconductors
increased rapidly. This surge in demand coincided with geopolitical factors, including disruptions in
the global transportation system and supply chains (such as the Suez Canal closure in March 2021),
lower supply as well as regulations resulting from the trade conflict between the U.S. and China.
These geopolitical factors further exacerbated the existing circumstances in 2021 and then continued
into 2022 as a result of the war in Ukraine and the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
Throughout the remainder of 2021 and into the first half of 2022, the semiconductor shortage
continued to impair the production of automobiles and auto parts, contributing to a markedly
constrained market for OEM programs in particular. This resulted in highly volatile customer call-off
orders and heavily impacted the Automotive Technologies Division’s sales volumes and revenues in
the first half of 2022. Despite a recovery in automobile production and the Division’s sales volumes in
the second half of 2022, the duration and severity of the impact of the global semiconductor
shortage is uncertain, and our business and results of operations may continue to be negatively
affected to the extent that the global semiconductor shortage continues or worsens.

In 2022, automobile production in the Europe region increased slightly by approximately 0.6%. In the
euro region, the number of vehicles produced increased by 4.2% from 2021. Automobile production
in the Americas region was approximately 9.3% above 2021. In the U.S., Canada and Mexico,
automobile production increased by approximately 9.4%, 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while
production levels in Brazil increased by 6.7%. Within the Greater China region, the number of
vehicles produced grew approximately 6.2% in 2022 relative to 2021. In the Asia/Pacific region,
automobile production increased by approximately 9.0% in 2022 as compared to 2021. The heaviest
increase of 23.8% was reported in India and South Korea and Thailand saw increases of 7.2% and
9.8%, respectively, while production in Japan decreased 1.1% (Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P
Global Mobility Light Vehicle Production Forecast (Base), January 2023], regions reflect the regional
structure of the Schaeffler Group).

_Developments in the Automotive Aftermarket_

The Automotive Aftermarket Division is generally influenced by the growing vehicle population,
measured as the number of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles up to 3.5 tons in weight, as
well as by the rising average age and growing complexity of vehicles. The number of passenger cars
and light commercial vehicles on the road impacts the size of the aftermarket for spare parts for
these vehicles. The global vehicle population has grown steadily over the past years and, in particular
in the Greater China region, is expected to continue to increase significantly in the coming years

2023], regions reflect the regional structure of the Schaeffler Group).

The average age of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles also has an impact on the
distribution aftermarkets in which we operate. In general, older vehicles require more repair and
maintenance services and spare parts than younger vehicles. Therefore, an increase in the age of
vehicles is expected to have a positive impact on the sales of our Automotive Aftermarket Division.
Furthermore, the average age of the vehicle population is impacted by sales volumes and the
production quality of the vehicles in the vehicle population (higher production quality generally
enables vehicles to run longer without repair or replacement). Increased sales and higher production
quality generally lead to decreased demand for the products and services of our Automotive
Aftermarket Division in the short-term. However, the same trends also increase the vehicle
population going forward and stimulate demand for our Automotive Aftermarket Division’s products
and services in the medium-to-long-term.

In 2020, the Automotive Aftermarket Division also experienced considerable declines in demand due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, however it suffered from lower revenue loss as compared to the
Automotive Technologies Division. In 2021, our Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenue grew
significantly compared to 2020, which was mainly attributable to the increase in sales volumes in the
first half of 2021 as compared to the low basis for comparison in 2020, while the second half
remained relatively flat compared to the first half. In 2022, our Automotive Technologies Division’s
revenue grew compared to 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to a favorable impact from
adjusted sales prices, whereby a significant portion of increased procurement costs were passed on
to the market as well as significant sales volume increases and the low basis in the 2021 comparative
period, which was marked by supply shortages. In addition, the trend towards repairing rather than
replacing vehicles has benefitted the Automotive Aftermarket Division.

_Developments in the Global Industrial Sector_

Within our Industrial Division, we serve customers in a variety of different sectors and sell
components and systems for a diverse range of applications, ranging from wind turbines to
aerospace engines and dentists’ drills. We believe that the high degree of diversification in our
businesses and the stability of our wholesale business (i.e., sale of spare parts and provision of
services) as well as our ability to attract new business and to enhance our portfolio with
opportunistic acquisitions, support the robustness of our revenues against downturns in individual
sectors. Each of these end-markets is influenced by different economic factors and is affected by a
downturn in different stages, making us less vulnerable to adverse changes in the micro-economic
environment or fluctuations of a particular economic parameter in any one of our industry market
sectors. Our Industrial Division’s customers conduct business in the sectors of wind, aerospace, rail,
offroad, two-wheelers, raw materials, power transmission and industrial automation.

In 2020, the Industrial Division experienced considerable declines in demand due to the COVID-19
pandemic, though it suffered from lower revenue loss as compared to the Automotive Technologies
Division, primarily due to the growing wind industry, especially in the Greater China region, which
bolstered the Division’s results. Despite heavy declines in the first half of 2020, the market began to
recover throughout the remainder of the year and in 2021, as recovery continued, global industrial
production grew significantly.

In 2022, our Industrial Division’s was affected by the indirect effects of the challenging sector
environment resulting from sustained semiconductor shortages, the resurgence of the COVID-19
pandemic in China, and the war in Ukraine, which was offset by increased sales volumes. Based on
preliminary estimates, global industrial production in mechanical engineering, transport equipment
and electrical equipment for 2022, measured as gross value added based on constant prices and
exchange rates, slowed considerably to approximately 3.7% from the prior year level, with growth


-----

rates in the second and fourth quarters of 2022 significantly lower than the rest of the year. In the
Europe region, industrial production in those sectors grew by approximately 2.4%, with noticeable
weakening in the fourth quarter due to increasing energy costs. Industrial production in those sectors
in the Greater China region grew by 3.5%, where growth, particularly in the electrical equipment
sector, was offset by declines in the second quarter of the year due to the reimplementation of
COVID-19 lockdown measures. Industrial production in those sectors in the Americas region rose by
3.5% (2.7% in the U.S.), where similar growth rates were reported for the mechanical engineering
and transport equipment sectors. In the Asia/Pacific region, industrial production in those sectors
grew by 6.6%. In Japan, industrial production in those sectors grew 8.2% and in India it grew 2.4%,
primarily as a result of growth in the mechanical engineering sectors in those countries, while in
South Korea, growth in the mechanical engineering sector declined and contributed to a decline in
industrial production of 0.7% (Source: Oxford Economics, December 2022). In 2022, the Industrial
Division benefitted from a strong increase in sales volumes in the industrial distribution and in the
industrial automation sector clusters, primarily in the Europe region. Increased demand in the
Americas, Asia/Pacific and Greater China regions contributed to revenue growth for the Division as
well.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Our key operating expenses are production costs (including raw material and energy costs), selling
expenses, R&D expenses and administrative expenses.

_Raw Material and Energy Costs_

Most of the raw materials that we use, such as steel, aluminum, copper, plastics and lubricants, are
subject to price volatility. Commodity market price trends affect our cost to varying degrees and in
some instances with some delay, depending on the terms of the relevant supplier contracts. The
prices of our production materials primarily depend, directly or indirectly, on the trend in the prices
of scrap steel, coking coal, iron ore and non-ferrous metals. In addition to fixing purchase prices for
certain of our raw materials, such as steel, for six to twelve months by entering into forward
purchase contracts, we also entered into short-, medium-, and long-term price and supply
agreements to mitigate the risk of rising energy prices arising on energy purchases for our own use,
because this risk increased in 2022 as compared to prior years.

The global economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the
commodities markets. Between January and April 2020, the prices of input materials key to our
operations considerably declined. However, with the third quarter economic rebound, prices rose
again, causing prices of nearly all of our key input materials to close at year-end at levels higher than
before the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend intensified throughout 2021, as strong demand continued
to drive drastic price increases for all input materials significant to us, with some prices even reaching
historic highs during the first half of the year, including steel in particular, which we use to
manufacture rolling bearings and automotive components.

In 2022, the war in Ukraine resulted in significant upward pressure on commodity prices and led to
an energy crisis, in particular in Europe, where imports of Russian natural gas were significantly
reduced. Prices surged in almost all of the commodity and energy markets important to the
Schaeffler Group. As the economic outlook deteriorated and demand for those commodities and
energy declined, prices began to fall throughout the rest of the year, with the most notable exception
being natural gas, for which prices did not peak until August 2022 as a result of the continuing supply
shortage. In Europe, natural gas prices reached historic highs in August 2022, which also caused a
surge in electricity prices in Europe due to the interconnectedness of the two markets. Natural gas
and electricity, which we use to operate our production machines, saw annual average prices in 2022
that were 136% and 75% above 2021 levels in Europe and the U.S., respectively. As a result of the
increase in natural gas prices, electricity prices in most of the EU doubled in 2022 as compared to


-----

2021. In the first half of 2022, steel prices remained at high levels worldwide, before falling in the
second half of the year, to a lower average price in 2022 as compared to 2021 (Source: S&P Global
Commodity Insight © [S&P Global Commodity Insight Pricing and Purchasing Forecasts, January
2023]). In Europe, prices for long steel products increased significantly in the second half of the year
due to the impact of the increase in energy costs on the energy intensive production process for long
steel (Source: S&P Global Commodity Insight © [S&P Global Commodity Insight Pricing and
Purchasing Forecasts, January 2023]). Prices of aluminum, which we use primarily for pressure die
castings, rose by 9% in 2022 as compared to 2021. Prices of copper, which we use primarily for
electric motors and mechatronic components, fell by 5% in 2022 as compared to 2021. Plastics,
which we use to produce cages for rolling bearings and lubricants, which we use both as
preservatives and to reduce friction in components, are often made from crude oil. In 2022, the
average price of crude oil rose by 42% as compared to 2021. Based on the Global Petrochemical
Index (IPEX) of the Independent Commodity Intelligence Service (ICIS), the average price of processed
petrochemical products, including the plastics we use, rose by 2% in 2022 as compared to 2021.

Increases in raw materials and energy prices could only be partially passed on to customers during
2022, which adversely affected margins in 2022. Overall, pricing dynamics are different among our
Divisions and businesses and price recovery is in most cases partial, and often delayed. For example,
in our Automotive Technologies Division, price recovery relies heavily on one-to-one customer
negotiations, which differ among customers and across regions. Comparatively, in our Industrial
Division, pricing initiatives have historically often demonstrated positive effects.

_Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses_

Innovation regarding product development and production technology is important in order to
maintain the profitability of our business in the long term. R&D expenses reflect the cost of
undertaking R&D activities in our worldwide R&D centers. For accounting purposes, such costs are
predominantly expensed. R&D is key to an innovative and competitive portfolio of products, which in
turn is a key factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions. Therefore, our R&D efforts are focused
not only on strengthening existing business, but also on developing new business.

We employ approximately 7,400 R&D staff and operate a global R&D network comprising 20 R&D
centers and additional R&D locations in a total of 25 countries. Key locations outside Germany are
the U.S., China, South Korea, India and Brazil. While we reduced our R&D spend in absolute numbers
in 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, our R&D ratio remained relatively stable in 2020 and
2021, although it was affected by an accounting policy change relating to the accounting for
development services that we implemented as of January 1, 2021, but applied to 2020 figures
retrospectively. Our R&D ratio declined in 2022, primarily due to the over proportional increase in
revenue as compared to R&D expenses (revenue increased 14.1% while R&D expenses increased
2.7%), in particular due to currency exchange rate effects reflected in revenue.

The following table provides additional information on our R&D activities during 2020, 2021 and
2022:

**_Cost Efficiency Programs and Initiatives_**

We have implemented a number of corporate restructuring, cost saving and efficiency initiatives over
the past years in order to improve our operating efficiency and reduce our cost base. These
initiatives, some of which are ongoing, have had and will continue to have, a material impact on our
results of operations.

Since 2019, we have been implementing programs in each of our three Divisions in order to render
the respective Divisions more efficient and prepare them for future challenges and for the
transformation in mobility and motion that is primarily driven by new technological developments
and changing customer requirements. As part of these programs, we have implemented various
structural and operational measures worldwide, particularly in Germany and Europe, including
downsizing of our workforce (from 92,478 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 82,773 as of
December 31, 2022), adjusting and harmonizing pricing, taking a disciplined approach with respect to
personnel and R&D expenses, reducing overhead and other functional expenses, optimizing
inventory management, adjusting our product and customer portfolios, increasing productivity by,
for instance, enhancing utilization of machine capacity, and improving our capital expenditure ratio
by focusing on profitable products with a promising future. We also made selective business
disposals, including the disposal of our Clausthal-Zellerfeld site in 2021 and of the global chain drive
business of the Automotive Technologies Division in 2022.

In 2020, we implemented various measures to adopt our expenses to the abrupt change in demand
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, which helped stabilize our earnings
during 2020 when conditions were particularly difficult and sequentially improve them when
revenues rose again thereafter. In September 2020, as part of our restructuring measures, we
announced that we will gradually close our production plants in Eltmann, Wuppertal, and
Luckenwalde, Germany, and relocate their activities by July 2023. Operations at the Wuppertal,
Germany plant were discontinued in 2022.

In November 2022, we initiated further restructuring measures to boost our competitiveness for the
transition from combustion engines to electric mobility (“E-mobility”) and reduce fixed costs and
overcapacity, particularly in the Automotive Technologies Division. The measures include reducing
our headcount by 1,300 positions worldwide, mainly in the Engine and Transmission BD and the
Bearings BD and in our central functions. Within Germany, mainly the Herzogenaurach, Buehl and
Homburg locations will be affected. In Herzogenaurach and Buehl, we plan to adapt our internal
structures to new market conditions and future technologies, such as E-mobility and hydrogen. In
Homburg, we plan to increase automation and develop more efficient internal structures. In addition,
Ingolstadt and Morbach will be affected and strategies for these locations, which produce
components solely for combustion engine vehicles, are currently being developed in consultation
with employee representatives for those locations. The measures are expected to generate
restructuring expenses of approximately €130 million.

As a result of our corporate restructuring, in 2020, we recognized restructuring expenses of €681
million under the efficiency and portfolio optimization programs, primarily in connection with
downsizing the workforce to adjust excess structural capacity. In 2021, we recorded net restructuring
income of €10 million, mainly as a result of a partial reversal of a restructuring provision we had
previously established. In 2022, we recorded restructuring expenses of €173 million primarily related
to the additional structural measures adopted in November 2022.

We believe that the structural and efficiency measures we have implemented significantly
contributed to our ability to withstand the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the
negative impacts of the war in Ukraine and rising inflation during 2022. We also believe that the
measures we have implemented and are continuing to implement position us well for profitable
growth in the future. The efficiency and operating improvements we anticipate are based on our


-----

estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, although we consider them to be
reasonable, and may be subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and
contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and a number of which are beyond our control. See
also “Risk Factors—Risks related to our Business Operations and the Markets in which we operate—
_We may be unable to implement our efficiency and portfolio optimization and growth programs_
_successfully.”_

**_Exchange Rate Fluctuations_**

The Schaeffler Group conducts its business in a large number of countries and in several international
currencies. The most important currencies (in addition to the euro) for the Schaeffler Group, with
respect to transaction and/or transaction exposure, are the U.S. dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the
Indian rupee, the South Korean won, the Mexican peso and the Hungarian forint.

As the Schaeffler Group’s production capacity often matches demand on a regional basis, currency
effects primarily impact currency translation, which has a considerable impact on Schaeffler AG’s
consolidated financial statements, as they are prepared and/or calculated in euro, as well as other
Schaeffler Group key figures that are calculated in euro. Overall, currency exchange rate effects had a
negative effect on the revenues generated during 2020, a positive impact on the revenues generated
during 2021 and a positive impact on the revenues generated during 2022. In 2022, the Schaeffler
Group’s consolidated revenue increased by 14.1% and by 9.4% excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation (as compared to increases of 10.0% and 9.7%, respectively, during 2021). In the
future, these currency exchange rate effects may reverse and lead to a decrease or less pronounced
increase in reported revenues and other key figures of the Schaeffler Group (see “Risk Factors—Risks
_related to our Business Operations and the Markets in which we operate—We are exposed to risks_
_associated with changes in exchange rates and hedging and exchange rate fluctuations could_
_adversely affect our results of operations.”)._

**_Acquisitions_**

In addition to organic growth, we undertook a number of selective acquisitions since 2020 that have
affected or will affect our results of operations. We also expect to pursue selective investments and
acquisitions in businesses and areas with opportunities for growth in the future. When comparing
financial information for different periods, investors should take into account the differences
resulting from these acquisitions, as well as the resulting changes regarding the composition of the
Schaeffler Group.

_Acquisitions_

Ewellix AB and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Ewellix” or the “Ewellix Group”)

On January 3, 2023, we acquired 100% of the shares of Ewellix (the “Ewellix Acquisition”), a
manufacturer of innovative linear motion and actuation solutions used in assembly automation,
medical applications and mobile machinery. The Ewellix Group’s six manufacturing and customization
sites in Europe, the U.S. and Asia and 1,196 employees are now part of the Schaeffler Group (please
note that the Ewellix Group sites and employees are not consolidated with the Schaeffler Group
plants and employees for purposes of the discussions of the latter in this Offering Memorandum).
The aggregate purchase price paid for Ewellix amounted to €582 million. In addition, we repaid a
shareholder loan in the amount of €10 million and repaid outstanding amounts under the Ewellix
Group’s credit facilities in the amount of €109 million. Ewellix reported revenues of approximately
€216 million for 2021 and is currently expected to post revenues of approximately €250 million for
2022. The Ewellix Acquisition is expected to result in significant additional goodwill impact. See note
5.7 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2022.

The activities of the Ewellix Group are reported in our Industrial Division.

Schaeffler ByWire Technologie GmbH & Co. KG. Schaeffler ByWire develops and sells the steer-bywire steering technology (“Space Drive”), a key technology for autonomous driving. The purchase
price for the 10% interest amounted to €74 million. In addition, we have agreed to make payments
that are contingent on Schaeffler ByWire’s revenue from 2028 to 2030, which we expect to be in the
single-digit millions. The acquisition resulted in a negative impact of €5 million on our net income in
2022, since the acquisition closing.

### Key Factors affecting Comparability

The financial information for the periods discussed in this Offering Memorandum are taken or
derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Except as otherwise stated, financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been taken or derived from the
comparative financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021, and financial information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2021 has been taken or derived from the comparative financial information as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements 2022. Accordingly, the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31,
2020 included herein may differ from the corresponding figures in the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements 2020, and the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021
included herein may differ from the corresponding figures in the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements 2022.

The comparability of the financial information for the periods discussed in this Offering
Memorandum has been influenced by the following events, facts and developments.

**_Accounting Policy Changes_**

Effective as of January 1, 2022, we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes
to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2022). As a result, starting in 2022, we began
reporting earnings before financial result and income taxes (EBIT) to include income (loss) from
equity-accounted investees. Figures for 2021 have been adjusted retrospectively (except in the
discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Results of Operations—Comparison of 2020 with 2021,” or as_
otherwise noted herein, to facilitate comparability between periods) to reflect this change. EBIT and
related figures for 2020 have not been adjusted retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully
comparable to the figures for subsequent periods.

Effective as of January 1, 2021 we changed our accounting policy for development services. The new
accounting treatment, which was applied retrospectively, reflects the relationship between
development services and future volume production in a different manner. Under the new model,
development costs of all customer projects are capitalized as costs to fulfill a contract starting when a
volume contract with the customer becomes highly probable, and then amortized appropriately over
the period of volume production. Revenue is similarly accrued as a contract liability and realized over
the period of volume production as well. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2021, we changed the
presentation of expenses for production technology and for use of real estate. Figures for the year
ended December 31, 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021 have
been adjusted retrospectively to reflect these accounting changes. The change presents the link
between development services and volume production in the financial information more accurately.
Previously, revenue was recognized for development services that represented a distinct, separately
identifiable performance obligation vis-à-vis the customer and for which we were entitled to
consideration under the contract. This revenue was recognized when the development services had
been rendered in full and the related expenses were expensed as cost of sales when revenue was
recognized. See note 1.4 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial figures for the
year ended December 31, 2020 presented in this Offering Memorandum are taken or derived from
the comparative figures for 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021.


-----

**_Schaeffler Group’s Segments_**

_Segment Structure_

We report financial information based on the following three Divisions: Automotive Technologies,
Automotive Aftermarket and Industrial.

_Customer Allocation to Segments_

The allocation of customers to segments is reviewed at least annually and adjusted where necessary.
In each of 2020, 2021 and 2022, such review resulted in the re-allocation of customers between
Divisions. To ensure that segment information is comparable between subsequent periods,
comparative information for the respective prior period included in the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements for a period has been adjusted using the customer allocation structure from
such period.

_Regional Structure_

Under our matrix organization, we view our business not only in terms of divisions and functions, but
have also grouped it into four regions: Europe (Germany, Western Europe, Middle East & Africa,
Central & Eastern Europe), the Americas (the United States & Canada, Mexico, South America),
Greater China (including Mainland China, and also Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao) and Asia/Pacific
(South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia and India).

### Explanation of Key Line Items 

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue is mainly derived from sales of bearings for automotive and industrial applications, as
well as transmission components and modules, engine components and systems. These applications,
components, modules and systems are sold to OEMs, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers (i.e., suppliers that
sell their products to Tier 1 suppliers) and through the aftermarket.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of producing products, rendering services or acquiring
merchandise sold. Production cost comprises all direct costs attributable to the process of
manufacturing goods and rendering services (e.g., raw materials, labor, depreciation of production
machinery) as well as allocated production-related overheads.

Our raw material costs are mainly related to steel, aluminum, copper, plastics and lubricants.

**_Gross Profit and Gross Margin_**

Our gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit in relation to
revenue.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Our R&D expenses mainly comprise labor costs for personnel (e.g., for our R&D engineers).
Furthermore, material cost, service fees and amortization of machinery related to our R&D activities
are recognized in R&D expenses.

**_Selling Expenses_**

Our selling expenses generally comprise personnel expenses and general freight and logistics
expenses.


-----

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Our administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel expenses as well as depreciation.

**_Other Income and Other Expenses_**

Other income and other expenses mainly consist of gains and losses from foreign exchange, disposal
of assets, increase and decrease of allowances, refunds of antitrust fines and accruals for
restructurings and legal cases. In 2022, other income and other expenses also included gains and
losses, respectively, arising in connection with recognizing at fair value short-, medium-, and longterm price and supply agreements we entered into to secure our energy supply. In 2020, other
expenses included a goodwill impairment allocated to our Automotive Technologies Division of €249
million. See “—Results of Operations—Comparison of 2020 with 2021—Other Income and Expenses.”

Foreign currency risk arising from operating activities is estimated as the foreign currency exchange
risk from operating activities and investing activities relating to the next twelve months. Our main
foreign exchange exposure is to U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi. The exposures are generally
hedged in line with the existing hedging strategy for the currency risk from operations of the next
twelve months, using appropriate derivative financial instruments, particularly forward exchange
contracts. Portfolio aspects and the current market environment are taken into account in executing
our hedging strategy.

**_EBIT_**

Effective as of January 1, 2022, EBIT is defined as earnings before financial result and income taxes.
Until December 1, 2021, we defined EBIT as earnings before financial result, income (loss) from
equity-accounted investees, and income taxes (see the notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements 2022). The discussion of EBIT for the years 2021 and 2022 under “—Results of
_Operations—Comparison of 2021 with 2022” below is based on EBIT pursuant to the new definition_
(and based on retrospectively adjusted figures for 2021), while the discussion for the years 2020 and
2021 under “—Results of Operations—Comparison of 2020 with 2021” below is based on the old
definition to facilitate comparability.

**_Financial Income_**

Financial income includes financial income on pension plan assets, fair value changes and
compensation payments on derivatives, foreign exchange gains, interest income on financial assets
and income from reversal of impairment losses on financial assets in the class “other loans
receivable” and for the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income on excess social tax
previously paid in Brazil, and for the year ended December 31, 2022, interest income on bank
balances in countries with foreign exchange restrictions and the change in the discount rate for
provisions.

**_Financial Expenses_**

Financial expenses mainly comprise interest expense on financial debt, amortization of cash flow
hedge accounting reserve, financial expense on pensions and partial retirement obligations, foreign
exchange losses and fair value changes and compensation payments on derivatives and, for the year
ended December 31, 2020, an impairment on an outstanding convertible loan receivable from a joint

**_Revenue_**

The following table shows the revenue contributions of each of our Divisions for 2021 and 2022 and
the year-to-year changes in these revenue contributions:

**For the year ended**

**December 31,**

**2021** **2022** **Change**


**(audited)**

**(in € million)**


**(unaudited)**

**(in %)**


Automotive Technologies....................................................................................................... 8,436 9,500 _12.6_

Automotive Aftermarket ........................................................................................................ 1,848 2,038 _10.3_

Industrial ................................................................................................................................ 3,568 4,271 _19.7_

**Total ...............................................................................................................................** **13,852** **15,809** **_14.1_**

Consolidated revenue increased from €13,852 million in 2021 by €1,957 million, or 14.1%, to €15,809
million in 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, consolidated revenue increased
by 9.4% in 2022. Revenue increased across all Divisions and regions in 2022. The growth in revenue
excluding the impact of currency translation was largely attributable to an increase in sales volumes
in each of the Automotive Technologies and Industrial Divisions as well as the favorable impact from
adjusted sales prices in all three Divisions, whereby a portion of increased procurement costs were
passed on to the market. The Automotive Technologies Division generated revenue growth of 7.7%
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, which was attributable to increased sales
volumes as a result of increased market demand for automobile production, the favorable impact
from adjusted sales prices, as well as the low basis for comparison in 2021, which was marked by
supply shortages.


-----

The Automotive Aftermarket Division generated revenue growth of 7.0% excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation, which was primarily attributable to the favorable impact from adjusted
sales prices and sales volume growth that was partially offset by a considerable decline in sales
volumes in Central & Eastern Europe due to the war in Ukraine. The Industrial Division generated
revenue growth of 14.7% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, mainly attributable to
higher sales volumes globally, and particularly in the Europe region, within the industrial distribution
and industrial automation sector clusters.

_Automotive Technologies Division_

The Automotive Technologies Division’s revenue increased by €1,064 million, or 12.6%, from €8,436
million in 2021 to €9,500 million in 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation,
revenue in the Automotive Technologies Division increased by 7.7%. The growth of the Automotive
Technologies Division’s revenue was attributable to increased sales volumes as a result of increased
market demand for automobile production, the favorable impact from adjusted sales prices, as well
as the low basis for comparison in 2021, which was marked by supply shortages. Growth in the EMobility and Chassis Systems BDs as a result of higher sales volumes driven by market demand and
product ramp-ups positively impacted revenue. Compared to the average growth rate of regional
automobile production volumes of 6.2% in 2022 (Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility
Light Vehicle Production Forecast (Base), January 2023]), at 7.7% growth, the Automotive
Technologies Division’s growth in revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency translation
exceeded the market trend in automobile production in 2022.

Revenue for the Europe region increased by 11.9%, or 11.8% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, in 2022, while automobile production increased by 0.6%. In the Americas region, revenue
increased by 26.0% in 2022, or 14.1% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, while
automobile production increased by 9.3%. In the Greater China region, revenue increased by 5.7%, or
decreased by 1.4%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, while automobile
production increased by 6.2%. The Asia/Pacific region reported revenue growth of 6.8%, or 4.5%,
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, while automobile production increased by 9.0%
(Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light Vehicle Production Forecast (Base),
January 2023], regions reflect the regional structure of the Schaeffler Group).

The E-Mobility BD’s revenue increased by 29.9%, or 24.2% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation in 2022. The Engine Systems and Transmission Systems BD’s revenue increased by 9.9% in
2022, or 4.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The Bearings BD’s revenue
increased by 8.3% in 2022, or 4.6% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The Chassis
Systems BD’s revenue increased by 30.5%, in 2022, or 28.4% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation.

_Automotive Aftermarket Division_

The Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenue increased by €190 million, or 10.3% (7.0% excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation), from €1,848 million in 2021 to €2,038 million in 2022. The
growth in revenue during the year was primarily attributable to the favorable impact from adjusted
sales prices and sales volume growth that was partially offset by a considerable decline in sales
volumes in Central & Eastern Europe due to the war in Ukraine. In the Europe region, the Automotive
Aftermarket Division’s revenue increased by 6.2% in 2022 (6.4% excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation), primarily driven by adjusted sales prices and an increase in sales volumes in the
second half of 2022. Higher sales volumes in the Western Europe and the Middle East & Africa
subregions more than offset the considerable decline in sales volumes in Central & Eastern Europe
due to the war in Ukraine. In the Americas region, the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenue
increased by 19.6% (6.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation), primarily driven by
the favorable impact from adjusted sales prices, which offset the negative impact of decreased sales


-----

volumes in the automotive OES business in the U.S. & Canada subregion, which were not fully offset
by increased sales volumes in the independent aftermarket business in the South American and
Mexico subregion. In the Greater China region, revenue grew by 15.1% (or 6.7% excluding the impact
of foreign currency translation), mainly due to the expansion of the Division’s e-commerce business.
In the Asia/Pacific region, revenue grew by 21.5% (or 16.4% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation), mainly due to higher sales volumes in the independent aftermarket business in India.

_Industrial Division_

The Industrial Division’s revenue increased by €704 million, or 19.7% (14.7% excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation), from €3,568 million in 2021 to €4,271 million in 2022. This increase was
primarily attributable to the strong increase in sales volumes in the industrial distribution and in the
industrial automation sector clusters globally, and particularly in the Europe region. All market
regions of the Industrial Divisions increased their revenue, with the Europe and Asia/Pacific regions
reporting the highest growth rates. Revenue in the Europe region increased by 19.8% (20.4%
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation), primarily due to the strong increase in sales
volumes referenced above. Revenue in the Asia/Pacific region increased by 17.5% (13.2% excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation), primarily due to volume growth in the industrial
distribution and two wheelers sector clusters. Revenue in the Americas region increased by 25.0%
(11.6% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation), were attributable to both higher sales
volumes and a favorable impact of sales prices in industrial distribution and the offroad and raw
materials sector clusters. In the Greater China region, revenue grew by 17.7% (8.8%) excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation), mainly due to increased volumes in the raw materials and
industrial automation clusters and increased volumes in the wind sector cluster in the second half of
2022.

Gross profit increased from €3,440 million in 2021 by €139 million, or 4.1%, to €3,579 million in 2022.
The gross profit margin decreased from 24.8% in 2021 by 2.2 percentage points to 22.6% in 2022.
The decrease was mainly attributable to significantly increased procurement costs, which were not
fully offset by adjustments to sales prices.

The gross profit of the Automotive Technologies Division decreased from €1,807 million in 2021 by
€124 million, or 6.9%, to €1,683 million in 2022. The gross profit margin decreased from 21.4% in
2021 by 3.7 percentage points to 17.7% in 2022, primarily due to significantly increased procurement
costs, which were not fully offset by adjustments to sales prices.

The gross profit of the Automotive Aftermarket Division increased from €585 million in 2021 by €57
million, or 9.7%, to €642 million in 2022. The gross profit margin remained relatively stable, with a
decrease of 0.1 percentage points from 31.6% in 2021 to 31.5% in 2022. The decrease in gross profit
was mainly attributable to significantly increased procurement costs, which were largely offset by
adjustments to sales prices, which contributed to the gross profit margin remaining near the prior
year level.


-----

The gross profit of the Industrial Division increased from €1,048 million in 2021 by €207 million, or
19.8%, to €1,255 million in 2022. The gross profit margin remained constant year over year at 29.4%
despite the negative impacts of significantly higher procurement costs as well as freight and logistics
costs and non-operating one-off items, which were offset by adjustments to sales prices and
economies of scale realized as a result of increased sales volumes.

**_R&D Expenses_**

R&D expenses increased by €20 million, or 2.7%, from €748 million in 2021 to €768 million in 2022.
R&D expenses increased in our Automotive Technologies Division from €602 million in 2021 to €604
million in 2022. R&D expenses increased from €16 million in 2021 to €18 million in 2022 in our
Automotive Aftermarket Division. R&D expenses increased from €130 million in 2021 to €146 million
in 2022 in our Industrial Division. In 2022, R&D expenses represented 4.9% of our revenue, a
decrease of 0.5 percentage points from 5.4% in 2021.

**_Selling Expenses_**

Selling expenses increased from €977 million in 2021 by €148 million, or 15.2%, to €1,126 million in
2022. This increase was primarily due to higher freight and logistics costs.

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Administrative expenses increased from €540 million in 2021 by €69 million, or 12.7%, to €609
million in 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased expenses in connection with
digitalization and sustainability activities.

**_Other Income and Other Expenses_**

The following table shows our other income for 2021 and 2022 and the year-to-year changes:

**For the year ended**

Miscellaneous other income ....................................................................................... 139 212 _53.1_

**Total ............................................................................................................................** **222** **213** **_(3.9)_**

Gains on reversal of provisions in both 2021 and 2022 mainly related to the reversal of provisions
recognized in prior years relating to headcount reductions. Miscellaneous other income in 2022
included €107 million in gains on measuring at fair value through profit or loss short-, medium-, and
long-term price and supply agreements we entered into to mitigate the risk of rising energy prices
arising on energy purchases for our own use. These related primarily to forward purchase contracts
for electricity and gas. Additionally, in 2022 this line item included a gain of €29 million on the
remeasurement of Schaeffler ByWire Technologie GmbH & Co. KG, which was previously held at
equity and is now fully consolidated following our acquisition of the remaining interest in the
company in 2022, as well as €30 million in government grants. Miscellaneous other income in 2021
included income of €40 million of refunds of excess social tax paid in Brazil in the past following a
ruling by the Brazilian supreme court, €33 million in government grants and €3 million in gains from
the curtailment of plans underlying defined benefit obligations.

Miscellaneous other expenses .................................................................................... 131 182 _38.8_

**Total ............................................................................................................................** **131** **280** **_113.4_**

Foreign exchange losses consist largely of exchange losses from operations and exchange losses
related to forward exchange contracts. In 2022, netting foreign exchange gains and losses resulted in
a net exchange loss of €98 million (prior year: gain of €2 million).

Miscellaneous other expenses in 2022 included mainly €111 million in expenses related to headcount
reductions (prior year: €35 million), of which €102 million related to the structural measures we
implemented in November 2022. Other miscellaneous expenses in 2022 related to impairment losses
and losses on disposal in connection with the sale of companies and planned sale of companies of
€23 million (prior year: €11 million), as well as losses on measuring derivatives we entered into to
mitigate energy price risk at fair value through profit and loss of €11 million (prior year: €0 million).
Other miscellaneous expenses in 2021 related to expenses for the remediation of past environmental
impacts and rehabilitating commercial land and expenses related to legal and litigation risks.

**_EBIT_**

The following table shows the contributions to EBIT of each of our Divisions for 2021 and 2022 and
the year-to-year changes in these EBIT contributions:

**EBIT ...........................................................................................................** **1,220** **974** **_(20.2)_**

_EBIT margin (in %) ....................................................................................._ _8.8_ _6.2_

EBIT decreased from €1,220 million in 2021 by €247 million, or 20.2%, to €974 million in 2022. As a
result, the EBIT margin decreased by 2.7 percentage points, from 8.8% in 2021 to 6.2% in 2022. EBIT
in 2022 was adversely affected by special items in the amount of €72 million.

Special items in 2022 relating to restructuring had a negative effect on EBIT of €173 million and were
mainly attributable to the further restructuring measures initiated in November 2022 and expenses
related to the consolidation of our footprint in Europe. Special items related to M&A had a net
positive effect on EBIT of €5 million and were mainly attributable to the revaluation gain related to a
business combination achieved in stages. Other special items in 2022 of €97 million, mainly affecting
the Automotive Technologies and Industrial Divisions, related to net gains that arose in connection


-----

with recognizing at fair value short-, medium-, and long-term price and supply agreements we
entered into to secure our energy supply.

In 2021, special items in the amount of €1 million adversely affected EBIT. Special items in 2021
relating to restructurings had a net positive effect on EBIT of €10 million and were mainly
attributable to the Roadmap 2025 divisional sub-programs, resulting in a reversal of a restructuring
provision established in the previous year, since the cost of implementing certain structural measures
was less than the originally planned costs, while expenses of consolidating the footprint in Europe
had a partially offsetting effect. Special items for restructurings in 2021 also included an adjustment
to a provision for the setup of a shared services center started in 2017. Special items relating to legal
cases in 2021 had a net positive effect of €32 million and primarily included income related to a court
ruling and related follow-up litigation in Brazil. Other special items in 2021, with a negative effect on
EBIT of €43 million, included adjustments for expenses of remediating past environmental impacts
and rehabilitating commercial land, the effect on net income of reversing an impact of foreign
currency translation related to a subsidiary that is no longer consolidated as it is no longer active, and
special projects.

Accordingly, EBIT before special items, or Adjusted EBIT, decreased to €1,046 million in 2022 (prior
year: €1,222 million), and the EBIT margin before special items decreased from 8.8% by 2.2
percentage points to 6.6% (prior year: 8.8%). The decrease in EBIT margin before special items in
2022 was primarily due to the lower gross profit margin, which resulted from significantly higher
procurement costs that were only partly offset by adjustments to sales prices, as well as higher
freight and logistics costs.

The Automotive Technologies Division’s total EBIT decreased from €579 million in 2021 by
€327 million, to €253 million in 2022. The Automotive Technologies Division’s EBIT margin decreased
by 4.2 percentage points from 6.9% in 2021 to 2.7% in 2022. Special items recognized by the
Automotive Technologies Division in 2022 had a negative impact on EBIT of €39 million. In 2021,
special items of the Automotive Technologies Division positively affected EBIT by €35 million.
Accordingly, EBIT before special items decreased to €292 million in 2022 (prior year: €544 million),
and the EBIT margin before special items decreased to 3.1% (prior year: 6.4%). The decrease in EBIT
margin before special items was primarily due to the lower gross profit margin, which resulted from
significantly higher procurement costs, which were only partially offset by adjustments to sales prices
as well as the negative impact of volatility in customer call-off orders, which negatively impacted
production efficiency. The main additional adverse impact came from higher freight and logistics
costs.

The Automotive Aftermarket Division’s total EBIT decreased from €274 million in 2021 by €24 million,
or 8.6%, to €251 million in 2022. The Automotive Aftermarket Division’s EBIT margin decreased from
14.8% in 2021 to 12.3% in 2022. EBIT in 2022 was negatively impacted by €5 million in special items,
as compared to 2021 when EBIT was positively affected by €18 million in special items. As a result,
EBIT before special items decreased to €255 million in 2022 (prior year: €256 million), and the EBIT
margin before special items decreased to 12.5% (prior year: 13.9%). The decrease in the EBIT margin
before special items was primarily due to higher selling expenses, partly attributable to the prior year
impact of a favorable one-off item related to the reimbursement of expenses by a service provider
for the AKO.

The Industrial Division’s total EBIT increased from €367 million in 2021 by €103 million to
€470 million in 2022. The Industrial Division’s EBIT margin increased from 10.3% in 2021 to 11.0% in
2022. In 2022, EBIT was adversely negatively affected by special items amounting to €28 million, as
compared to 2021 when EBIT was negatively affected by €55 million in special items. As a result, EBIT
before special items increased by €77 million, or 18.3% to €499 million (prior year: €421 million). The
Division’s EBIT margin before special items remained stable at 11.7% in 2022 (prior year: 11.8%)
despite the negative impacts of significantly higher procurement costs as well as freight and logistics

costs and non-operating one-off items, which were offset by adjustments to sales prices and
economies of scale realized due to increased sales volumes, which improved the gross profit margin
and decreased functional costs as a percentage of revenue.

**_Financial Result_**

The following table shows our financial results for 2021 and 2022 and the year-to-year changes:

**For the year ended**

**Financial result ...........................................................................................................** **(98)** **(121)** **_23.8_**

- Including transaction costs and prepayment penalties.

Our financial result declined from a net financial expense of €98 million in 2021 by €23 million, or
23.8%, to a net financial expense of €121 million in 2022. In 2022, financial result comprised financial
income of €51 million (prior year: €50 million) and financial expenses of €172 million (prior year:
€148 million).

In 2022, interest expense on financial debt amounted to €99 million (prior year: €108 million).
Interest expense on financial debt included €1 million in derecognition of deferred transactions costs
in 2022 and 2021.

Net foreign exchange losses on financial assets and liabilities and net losses on derivatives amounted
to €27 million in 2022 (prior year: €1 million) and mainly related to the devaluation of the euro
against the U.S. dollar.

In 2022, pensions and partial retirement obligations gave rise to net interest expenses of €25 million
(prior year: €18 million).

Other items generated net income of €30 million in 2022, resulting primarily from interest on bank
balances in countries with foreign exchange restrictions and the change in the discount rate for
provisions (prior year: net income of €30 million, resulting primarily from interest on excess social tax
paid in the past in Brazil that can be offset against other tax payment obligations in the future
following a ruling by the Brazilian superior court).

**_Income Taxes_**

The following table shows our income tax expenses for 2021 and 2022 and the year-to-year changes:

**For the year ended**

Deferred income taxes ................................................................................................ (31) (96) _˃100_

**Income taxes...............................................................................................................** **348** **268** **_(23.0)_**

Income tax expense decreased from €348 million in 2021 by €80 million to €268 million in 2022,
consisting of current income tax expense of €364 million (prior year: €378 million) and deferred
income taxes of €96 million (prior year: deferred tax income of €31 million). This resulted in an
effective tax rate of 31.4% in 2022 (prior year: 31.0%). The increase in the effective tax rate


-----

compared to the prior year was primarily the result of higher non-deductible expenses. Those
expenses related to higher deferred tax liabilities on dividends expected to be paid by subsidiaries
and higher withholding taxes, which were partially offset by the recognition of deferred taxes on
temporary differences and loss carryforwards.

The average domestic tax rate was 28.7% in 2022 and 2021. This tax rate consisted of corporation
tax, including the solidarity surcharge, of 15.9% as well as the average trade tax rate of 12.8%.
Deviations from the expected tax rate resulted from differing country-specific tax rates applicable to
German and foreign entities.

**_Net Income (loss) attributable to Shareholders of the Parent Company_**

For the reasons set forth above, net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent
company decreased from a net income of €756 million in 2021 by €199 million to a net income of
€557 million in 2022.

Consolidated revenue increased from €12,589 million in 2020 by €1,263 million, or 10.0%, to €13,852
million in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, consolidated revenue increased
by 9.7% in 2021. Revenue increased across all Divisions and regions in 2021. The Automotive
Technologies Division generated revenue growth of 7.4% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation, which was attributable to the increase in demand in the first half of 2021 from the very
low basis in the first half of 2020. In the second half of 2021, growing bottlenecks in global supply
chains, particularly those for semiconductors, significantly reduced customers’ call-off orders and
considerably lowered sales volumes of the Automotive Technologies Division, driven by the market.
Unlike the Automotive Technologies Division, the Automotive Aftermarket and Industrial Divisions
grew in the second half of 2021 as well, resulting in both Divisions generating full-year growth rates
of 12.6% and 13.9%, respectively (13.0% and 13.6%, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation).

_Automotive Technologies Division_

The Automotive Technologies Division’s revenue increased by €620 million, or 7.9%, from €7,816
million in 2020 to €8,436 million in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation,
revenue in the Automotive Technologies Division increased by 7.4%. The growth of the Automotive
Technologies Division’s revenue was attributable to the increase in sales volumes for the first half of
2021 from the low basis for comparison across all BDs and regions. In the second half of 2021,
however, the Division’s revenue was adversely affected by supply chain disruptions, particularly the
global semiconductor shortage and the reduction in the production of passenger cars and Iight
commercial vehicles by more than 10% (Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light
Vehicle Production Forecast (Base), January 2023]), which significantly reduced customer demand,
while the second half of 2020 had already been characterized by noticeable catch-up effects
following the significant declines in the first half of the year. In contrast to the general market trend,
the E-Mobility BD ended the second half of 2021 slightly ahead of the prior year level due in part to
product ramp-ups, generating a full-year growth rate well into the double-digits. Compared to the
average growth rate of regional automobile production volumes of 3.4% in 2021 (Source: S&P Global
Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light Vehicle Production Forecast (Base), January 2023]), at 7.4%
growth, the Automotive Technologies Division’s growth in revenue excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation exceeded the market trend in automobile production in 2021.

Revenue for the Europe region increased by 6.7%, or 7.1% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation in 2021, while automobile production declined by 2.5%. In the Americas region, revenue
increased by 5.5% in 2021 or 6.8% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, while
automobile production increased by 2.5%. In the Greater China region, revenue increased by 9.2% or


-----

5.7% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, while automobile production increased by
5.6%. The Asia/Pacific region reported revenue growth of 12.6%, or 13.8% excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation, while automobile production increased by 7.7% (Source: S&P Global
Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light Vehicle Production Forecast (Base), January 2023], regions
reflect the regional structure of the Schaeffler Group).

The E-Mobility BD’s revenue increased by 18.9%, or 17.8% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation in 2021. The Engine Systems BD’s revenue increased by 4.9% in 2021. Excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased by 4.8%. The Transmission Systems BD’s
revenue increased by 6.6% in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue
increased by 6.4%. The Chassis Systems BD’s revenue increased by 7.4%, in 2021. Excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation, the Chassis Systems BD’s revenue increased by 7.1%.

_Automotive Aftermarket Division_

The Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenue increased by €206 million, or 12.6% (13.0% excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation), from €1,642 million in 2020 to €1,848 million in 2021. The
considerable growth in revenue during the year was attributable to the increase in sales volumes in
the first half of 2021 from the very low basis for comparison across all BDs and regions. Although the
Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenue for the second half of 2021 was close to flat with the first
half of 2021, the growth rate nevertheless declined considerably over the course of the year since
the second half of 2020 had already been marked by noticeable catch-up effects following the heavy
slumps earlier that year. Full-year revenue recovered across all regions compared to 2020;
considerably higher sales volumes in the Europe and Americas regions were the main drivers behind
the Division’s growth. In the Central & Eastern Europe, Western Europe, South America, and U.S. &
Canada subregions, the IAM business, in particular, grew considerably. The OES business in the
subregions of Germany and Western Europe grew substantially as well. In addition, the Greater China
region significantly expanded its e-commerce business in the fiscal year 2021, which contributed a
majority of the Division’s growth in the region. The growth reported by the Asia/Pacific region
resulted mainly from considerably higher sales volumes in both the independent aftermarket and
original equipment manufacturer businesses in India.

_Industrial Division_

The Industrial Division’s revenue increased by €436 million, or 13.9% (13.6% excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation), from €3,132 million in 2020 to €3,568 million in 2021. This increase was
primarily attributable to strong growth in industrial distribution, industrial automation, power
transmission and offroad sector clusters. Throughout the year, regional revenue trends varied, for
example, while the revenue trend in the Europe region remained moderate in the first half of 2021,
the Division generated considerable growth in the region throughout the second half of 2021,
especially in the industrial distribution and in the industrial automation and power transmission
sector clusters. In contrast, the Greater China region experienced a considerable decrease in its
growth rate in the second half of 2021, primarily due to a heavy decline in demand in the wind sector
cluster following a pull-forward effect due to the anticipated termination of subsidies for offshore
wind turbines at year-end 2020. The America’s region revenue trend was primarily attributable to
growth in the industrial distribution cluster. Growth in the Asia/Pacific region resulted primarily from
increased volumes in India, mainly due to the wind, two-wheelers and offroad sector clusters as well
as industrial distribution cluster.

Revenue increased in all four regions in 2021, with the Asia/Pacific and Greater China regions
reporting the highest growth rates excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.

Revenue in our Europe region increased by 8.2%, or 8.6% excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation. In the Americas region, revenue increased by 8.5%, or 10.3% excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation. The Greater China region grew its revenue by 12.0%, or 8.8% excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Asia/Pacific region increased by 14.8%, or
by 16.1% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.

_Accounting Policy Changes.”_

Cost of sales increased from €9,730 million in 2020 by €682 million, or 7.0%, to €10,412 million in
2021 primarily as a result of the continued ramp up in business and the low basis for comparison in
2020, when costs were adjusted rapidly to reflect the heavy decline in demand, as well as significant
rises in prices of raw materials and energy in the course of 2021. However, due to scale effects,
particularly in the first half of the year, and structural cost reduction measures implemented in the
prior year, cost of sales increased less than revenue.

and have been taken from the comparative figures for 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and “—Key Factors affecting Comparability—
_Accounting Policy Changes.”_

Gross profit increased from €2,859 million in 2020 by €580 million, or 20.3%, to €3,439 million in
2021. The gross profit margin increased from 22.7% in 2020 by 2.1 percentage points to 24.8% in
2021. The increase was mainly attributable to scale effects in connection with the continued ramp up
of business and the impact of structural cost reduction measures implemented in 2020 which were
only partially offset by the significant increase in input prices.

The gross profit of the Automotive Technologies Division increased from €1,434 million in 2020 by
€370 million, or 25.8%, to €1,804 million in 2021. The gross profit margin increased from 18.3% in
2020 by 3.1 percentage points to 21.4% in 2021, primarily due to economies of scale during the first
half of 2021 despite the significant increase in input prices.

The gross profit of the Automotive Aftermarket Division increased from €569 million in 2020 by €16
million, or 2.9%, to €585 million in 2021. The gross profit margin decreased from 34.6% in 2020 by
2.9 percentage points to 31.7% in 2021, largely due to higher product expenses.

The gross profit of the Industrial Division increased from €856 million in 2020 by €195 million, or
22.7%, to €1,051 million in 2021. The gross profit margin increased from 27.3% in 2020 by 2.1
percentage points to 29.4% in 2021, primarily due to economies of scale.

**_R&D Expenses_**

R&D expenses increased by €64 million, or 9.4%, from €684 million in 2020 to €748 million in 2021,
mainly as a result of the lower base in 2020, when we adjusted our R&D expenses in line with the
lower revenues in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. R&D expenses increased in our Automotive
Technologies Division from €540 million in 2020 to €601 million in 2021. R&D expenses decreased
from €18 million in 2020 to €15 million in 2021 in our Automotive Aftermarket Division. R&D
expenses increased from €126 million in 2020 to €131 million in 2021 in our Industrial Division. In
2021, R&D expenses represented 5.4% of our revenue in line with 5.4% in 2020.


-----

**_Selling Expenses_**

Selling expenses increased from €881 million in 2020 by €96 million, or 10.9%, to €977 million in
2021. This increase was primarily due to the recovery of business in 2021 from a low base in 2020 as
well as to the commencement of operations of the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s assembly and
packaging center. Favorable one-off items in selling expenses related to an agreement reached on a
retroactive reimbursement of expenses by a service provider as well as higher sales volumes had an
offsetting impact.

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Administrative expenses increased from €491 million in 2020 by €49 million, or 10.1%, to
€540 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to the recovery of business in 2021 from a low
base in 2020.

“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and “—Key Factors affecting Comparability—
_Accounting Policy Changes.”_

Gains on reversal of provisions in both 2020 and 2021 mainly related to provisions built in prior years
relating to headcount reductions. Miscellaneous other income in 2021 included income of €40 million
of refunds of excess social tax paid in Brazil in the past following a ruling by the Brazilian supreme
court, €33 million in government grants and €3 million in gains from the curtailment of plans
underlying defined benefit obligations. Miscellaneous other income in 2020 includes €25 million in
gains on the curtailment of plans underlying defined benefit obligations as well as €28 million in
government grants.

Foreign exchange losses consist largely of exchange losses from operations and exchange losses
related to forward exchange contracts. In 2021, netting foreign exchange gains and losses resulted in
a net exchange gain of €2 million (prior year: loss of €41 million).

Miscellaneous other expenses in 2021 included mainly €35 million in expenses related to headcount
reductions (prior year: €676 million) in connection with the structural measures we implemented.
Other miscellaneous expenses in 2021 related to expenses for the remediation of past environmental

- Figures for 2020 have been adjusted retrospectively for certain accounting changes we implemented effective as of January 1, 2021
and have been taken from the comparative figures for 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and “—Key Factors affecting Comparability—
_Accounting Policy Changes.”_

** Effective as of January 1, 2022, we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022). As a result, starting in 2022, we began reporting earnings before financial result and income taxes (EBIT) to
include income (loss) from equity-accounted investees. Figures for 2021 have been adjusted retrospectively. EBIT and related figures
for 2020 have not been adjusted retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully comparable to the figures for subsequent periods.
See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and “—Key Factors affecting
_Comparability—Accounting Policy Changes.”_

EBIT increased from a negative €149 million in 2020 by €1,413 million to €1,264 million in 2021. As a
result, the EBIT margin improved from a negative 1.2% in 2020 by to 9.1% in 2021.

EBIT in 2021 was adversely affected by special items in the amount of €1 million. Special items in
2021 relating to restructurings had a net positive effect on EBIT of €10 million and were mainly
attributable to the Roadmap 2025 divisional sub-programs, resulting in a reversal of a restructuring
provision established in the previous year, since the cost of implementing certain structural measures
was less than the originally planned costs, while expenses of consolidating the footprint in Europe
had a partially offsetting effect. Special items for restructurings in 2021 also included an adjustment
to a provision for the setup of a shared services center started in 2017. Special items relating to legal
cases in 2021 had a net positive effect of €32 million and primarily included income related to a court
ruling and related follow-up litigation in Brazil. Other special items in 2021, with a negative effect on
EBIT of €43 million, included adjustments for expenses of remediating past environmental impacts
and rehabilitating commercial land, the effect on net income of reversing an impact of foreign
currency translation related to a subsidiary that is no longer consolidated as it is no longer active, and
special projects.

Special items in 2020 amounted to €946 million and included €681 million in expenses incurred to
expand the efficiency and portfolio optimization programs, especially in connection with downsizing
the workforce to adjust excess structural capacity. €580 million of these expenses related to the
package of measures adopted in September 2020. In addition, we recognized an impairment charge


-----

in relation to goodwill allocated to the Automotive Technologies Division in the amount of €249
million, which was recognized in 2020 because the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased uncertainty
and, therefore, to changes in the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of groups
of cash-generating units. Special items in 2020 also included €21 million for legal risks.

Accordingly, EBIT before special items, or Adjusted EBIT, increased to €1,266 million in 2021 (prior
year: €798 million), and the EBIT margin before special items increased to 9.1% (prior year: 6.3%).
The increase in EBIT margin before special items in 2021 was primarily due to economies of scale
during the first half of 2021, which resulted in an improved gross margin, as well as structural cost
reduction measures. In the second half of 2021, the market-driven decline in sales volumes in the
Automotive Technologies Division, in addition to the increased procurement costs, negatively
impacted EBIT before special items.

The Automotive Technologies Division’s total EBIT increased from a negative €344 million in 2020 by
€964 million, to €620 million in 2021. The EBIT margin increased from a negative 4.4% in 2020 to
7.4% in 2021. Special items recognized by the Automotive Technologies Division in 2021 had a
positive impact on EBIT of €35 million. In 2020, special items of the Automotive Technologies Division
negatively affected EBIT by €608 million. Accordingly, EBIT before special items increased to €585
million in 2021 (prior year: €263 million), and the EBIT margin before special items increased to 6.9%
(prior year: 3.4%). The increase in EBIT margin before special items was primarily due to economies
of scale during the first half of 2021 and production costs that remained low at the time, particularly
in the first quarter, which resulted in a significantly improved gross margin. Structural cost reduction
measures previously implemented also had a positive impact. In the second half of 2021, the
significant market-driven decline in sales volumes as well as the significant increase in procurement
costs had a growing adverse impact on EBIT before special items.

The Automotive Aftermarket Division’s total EBIT increased from €228 million in 2020 by €44 million,
or 19.3%, to €272 million in 2021. The EBIT margin increased from 13.9% in 2020 by 0.8 percentage
points to 14.7% in 2021. EBIT in 2021 was positively impacted by €18 million in special items, as
compared to 2020 when EBIT was negatively affected by €30 million in special items. As a result, EBIT
before special items decreased to €254 million in 2021 (prior year: €258 million), and the EBIT margin
before special items decreased to 13.8% (prior year: 15.7%). The decrease in the EBIT margin before
special items is attributable to higher product expenses that considerably decreased the gross profit
margin and increased selling expenses related to the commencement of operations at the assembly
and packaging center. Higher sales volumes as well as favorable one-off items in selling expenses
related to an agreement on a retroactive reimbursement of expenses by a service provider had an
offsetting impact.

The Industrial Division’s total EBIT increased from a negative €33 million in 2020 by €404 million to
€372 million in 2021. The EBIT margin increased from a negative 1.0% in 2020 to 10.4% in 2021. EBIT
for 2021 was adversely affected by special items amounting to €55 million. In 2020, EBIT was
adversely affected by special items amounting to €309 million. As a result, EBIT before special items
increased by €150 million, or 54.4% to €426 million (prior year: €276 million). The Division’s EBIT
margin before special items increased by 3.2 percentage points to 12.0% (prior year: 8.8%) largely
driven by economies of scale, which improved the gross profit margin and decreased functional costs
as a percentage of revenue, as well as by the structural cost reduction measures expanded in 2020.

**Financial result ...........................................................................................................** **(185)** **(98)** **_(47.0)_**

- Including transaction costs and prepayment penalties.

Our financial result improved from a net financial expense of €185 million in 2020 by €87 million, or
47.0%, to a net financial expense of €98 million in 2021. In 2021, financial result comprised financial
income of €50 million (prior year: €18 million) and financial expenses of €148 million (prior year:
€204 million).

In 2021, interest expense on financial debt amounted to €108 million (prior year: €100 million).
Interest expense on financial debt included €1 million in derecognition of deferred transactions costs
in 2021. Interest expense in 2020 included a prepayment penalty of €10 million and €4 million of
derecognition of deferred transaction costs in connection with the refinancing and early redemption
of certain bonds.

Net foreign exchange losses on financial assets and liabilities and net losses on derivatives amounted
to €1 million in 2021 (prior year: €6 million). There was no impact from embedded derivatives in
2021 (prior year: net losses of €31 million, relating to the early redemption of certain bonds).

In 2021, pensions and partial retirement obligations gave rise to net interest expenses of €18 million
(prior year: €22 million).

Other items generated net income of €30 million in 2021, resulting primarily from interest on excess
social tax paid in the past in Brazil that can be offset against other tax payment obligations in the
future following a ruling by the Brazilian superior court (prior year: net expenses of €26 million, of
which €22 million related to an impairment of an outstanding convertible loan receivable from a joint
venture).

**_Income Taxes_**

- Figures for 2020 have been adjusted retrospectively for certain accounting changes we implemented effective as of January 1, 2021
and have been taken from the comparative figures for 2020 included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2021. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and “—Key Factors affecting Comparability—
_Accounting Policy Changes.”_

Income tax expense increased from €51 million in 2020 by €297 million to €348 million in 2021,
consisting of current income tax expense of €378 million (prior year: €270 million) and deferred


-----

income taxes of €31 million (prior year: deferred tax income of €219 million). This resulted in an
effective tax rate of 31.0% in 2021 (prior year: 13.9%). The increase in the effective tax rate
compared to the prior year was primarily the result of higher pre-tax income as well as fewer one-off
items adversely affecting the effective tax rate and fewer non-deductible expenses. As a corporation,
Schaeffler AG was subject to German corporation tax and trade tax during 2020 and 2021. Trade tax
is levied by municipalities.

The average domestic tax rate was 28.7% in 2021 and 2020. This tax rate consisted of corporation
tax, including the solidarity surcharge, of 15.9% as well as the average trade tax rate of 12.8%.
Deviations from the expected tax rate resulted from differing country-specific tax rates applicable to
German and foreign entities.

**_Net Income (loss) attributable to Shareholders of the Parent Company_**

For the reasons set forth above, net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent
company increased from a net loss of €419 million in 2020 by €1,194 million to a net income of €775
million in 2021.

### Liquidity and Capital Resources

For 2020, 2021, and 2022, our principal source of liquidity was cash generated from operating
activities. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to fund our working capital
requirements and capital expenditures, including acquisitions, to make interest and principal
payments on our indebtedness and to make dividend payments to our shareholders. As of December
31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling €1,063 million, of which €241 million related to
countries with foreign exchange restrictions and other legal and contractual restrictions, such as
Brazil, South Korea and India. We also have the €500 million Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility (of
which €350 million were drawn on January 2, 2023, and we intend to draw the additional €150
million available in March 2023) and the €2.0 billion Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility (of which €55
million were utilized as of December 31, 2022, in the form of letters of credit), each under the
Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement. In addition, we have certain committed lines of
credit available to us in the equivalent of approximately €118 million, of which €17 million were
utilized as of December 31, 2022, primarily in the form of letters of credit. We have also established
the Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper Program, of which €50 million (book value: €50 million) was
utilized as of December 31, 2022. We expect to meet our working capital, capital expenditures
according to cash flow statement, dividend payment and investment requirements for the next
twelve months primarily through cash flows from operating activities. We may also, from time to
time, seek other sources of funding, which may include debt or equity financings, depending on our
financing needs and market conditions.

** Effective as of January 1, 2022, we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022). As a result, starting in 2022, we began reporting earnings before financial result and income taxes (EBIT) to
include income (loss) from equity-accounted investees. Figures for 2021 have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change. EBIT
and related figures for 2020 have not been adjusted retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully comparable to the figures for
subsequent periods. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information” and “—Key Factors
_affecting Comparability—Accounting Policy Changes.”_

**_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_**

Cash flows from operating activities decreased from €1,276 million in 2021 by €137 million, or 10.8%
to €1,139 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the €223 million decline in EBITDA over
the prior year as a result of increased non-cash expenses, in particular related to the additional
structural measures adopted in November 2022. Cash flows from operating activities in 2021 were
adversely affected by restructuring expenditures and an expansion of working capital. Cash outflows
from working capital of €340 million in 2022 increased by €52 million from €288 million in 2021,
driven by the increase in business activity and sales volumes. €240 million of the change from the
prior year period was due to higher trade receivables and lower trade payables of €240 million and
€91 million, respectively. A decrease in inventories had an offsetting impact of €277 million.

Cash flows from operating activities increased from €1,254 million in 2020 by €22 million, or 1.7% to
€1,276 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to the €1,119 million improvement in EBITDA
over the prior year. EBITDA in 2020 was negatively affected by largely non-cash restructuring
expenses related to the structural measures taken in Europe. Cash flows from operating activities in
2021 were adversely affected by restructuring expenditures and an expansion of working capital.
Cash outflows from working capital of €288 million increased by €279 million from €10 million in
2020, driven by the increase in business activity. €694 million of the change from the prior year
period was due to an increase in inventories. Lower trade receivables and higher trade payables had
an offsetting impact of €119 million and €298 million, respectively.

**_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_**

Cash outflow for investing activities consisted of €990 million in 2022, €716 million in 2021 and €642
million in 2020. Of these outflows, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and on
intangible assets amounted to €791 million in 2022, €671 million in 2021, and €633 million in 2020
(see “—Capital Expenditures,” which describes the balance sheet impact of our capital expenditures).
Cash outflow for M&A activities (net cash flow used for/from acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries
and interests in joint ventures) in 2022 was €195 million, which was primarily related to the
acquisitions of SPV Solarpark, CERASPIN, Schaeffler ByWire and Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives,
which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale the global chain drive business of the
Automotive Technologies Division. Cash outflow for M&A activities (net cash flow used for/from
acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures) in 2021 was €23 million
(approximately a third of which related to the acquisition of Bega International B.V.). Cash inflow
from M&A activities in 2020 consisted of €12 million, relating to a refund of a portion of the purchase
price for the acquisition of the interests in Elmotec Statomat GmbH in 2019 and to the disposal of
Schaeffler Bio-hybrid GmbH.

**_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_**

Cash from financing activities consisted of an outflow of €891 million in 2022, €527 million in 2021,
and an inflow of €526 million in 2020. Outflows of €336 million, €165 million and €298 million related
to dividends paid to shareholders and non-controlling interests in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In 2022, changes in financial debt resulted in €547 million in net cash outflows and related mainly to
the redemption of bonds in the amount of €545 million.

In 2021, changes in financial debt resulted in €302 million in net cash outflows and related mainly to
the redemption of €259 million in principal amount of Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes in October
2021, the repayment of Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper in an amount of €30 million and the
repayment of other financial indebtedness of €13 million.

In 2020, cash inflow was primarily a result of the issuance of €1.5 billion in new bonds, the placement
of €557 million in Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes and the issuance of €30 million in Schaeffler


-----

Group Commercial Paper. These cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows made to redeem
€798 million in bonds and to repay a capital investment loan of €250 million in full.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

We believe that investments in new products and technologies as well as in maintaining, updating
and expanding our global production network are crucial to the success of our business. At the same
time, we focus on the efficient allocation and use of our capital.

The following table sets out a breakdown of our total additions to property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets by region for 2020, 2021 and 2022.

**For the year ended**

**December 31,**

**2020** **2021** **2022**

Asia/Pacific .................................................................................................................................... 44 49 99

**Total additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (audited) ...................** **639** **670** **814**

In 2022, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to
€814 million and were focused primarily on investing in new product launches and expanding
capacity in the Europe and Greater China regions for the Automotive Technologies Division.
Investments in the Automotive Technologies Division were focused on the new center of excellence
for E-mobility in Buehl, Germany, and the expansion of our campus in Taicang, China. The
Automotive Aftermarket Division focused on investment in a logistics warehouse in the Americas
region. The Industrial Division invested primarily in expanding capacities in the Europe and Greater
China regions such as the construction of a logistics hall in Romania and a production hall in India.

As part of our “Roadmap 2025” strategy, we invested in the continued construction of a crossdivisional central laboratory to bundle our core expertise and key technologies for research and
development in Herzogenaurach and in completing the construction of a tool technology center at
our Hoechstadt location.

In 2021, total additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to €670
million and were focused mainly on investing in new business areas in the Automotive Technologies
Division and expanding capacity for existing business areas of the Industrial Division. Investments in
the Automotive Technologies Division were focused on machines for new products, such as
machinery for e-motor production in Hungary, and on capacity expansions in the Europe and Greater
China regions. The Automotive Aftermarket Division focused on investment in digital distribution
channels in the Europe region. The Industrial Division invested primarily in expanding capacities in
the Europe and Greater China regions such as in Romania, where the Division invested in the
construction of a new production building as well as in machines for rail bearings at the Brasov plant.
In Nanjing, in the Greater China region, we acquired supplemental machinery for the production
building for large-size bearings.

As part of our “Roadmap 2025” strategy, we invested in the construction of a tool technology center
at our Hoechstadt location and a cross-divisional center of excellence for the production of hydrogen
technology in Herzogenaurach.

In 2020, total additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to €639
million, dropping considerably from the prior year. In addition to the measures initiated in 2019 to
increase our capital efficiency, we also adapted our investing activities to the challenging


-----

environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our results of operations. The largest
share of total capital expenditures related to the Europe region, where we invested in the assembly
and packaging center in Halle, Germany, known as the Aftermarket Kitting Operation (the “AKO”). In
addition, the Automotive Technologies Division used funds for new product start-ups and to expand
capacity, including for customer orders in the field of E-mobility. In the Industrial Division, we
primarily invested in expanding production capacity for the rolling bearing business. In the Americas
region, capital expenditures related primarily to equipment and machinery for new product start-ups
and to expanding capacity in the Transmission Systems and E-mobility BDs. The Industrial Division in
the Americas region invested in expanding production capacity and new product start-ups. In the
Greater China region, we invested largely in expanding capacity and new product start-ups and
focused primarily on the Transmission and Engine Systems business divisions of the Automotive
Technologies Division. The Industrial Division mainly invested in its rolling bearing business. In the
Asia/Pacific region, significant investments related to the Industrial Division’s production capacity in
Vietnam and India. The Automotive Technologies Division primarily invested in the Transmission,
Chassis and Engine Systems business divisions.

### Financial Debt

**_Sources of Financing_**

As of December 31, 2022, our financial debt amounted to €3,298 million (€3,238 million non-current
financial debt and €60 million current financial debt) and lease liabilities of €219 million. In addition,
in connection with the Ewellix Acquisition, we drew €350 million under the Schaeffler Group Term
Loan Facility on January 2, 2023 and we expect to draw the remaining €150 million available under
the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility in March 2023 to replenish cash on hand used for the Ewellix
Acquisition in January 2023. The main sources of financing made available to us are the Schaeffler
Group Term Loan Facility, the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility, the Schaeffler Group Notes and the
Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes (Schuldscheine) as described below. We also have access to
various bilateral lines of credit, the Schaeffler Group Factoring Program established in 2021 and the
Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper Program established in 2019.

_Schaeffler Group Facilities_

Schaeffler AG is party to a €2.5 billion syndicated ESG linked term loan and revolving credit facilities
agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement,”
the term loan facility made available thereunder, the “Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility,” and the
revolving credit facility made available thereunder, the “Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility,” and
together with the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility, the “Schaeffler Group Facilities”). Accrued
interest on the Schaeffler Group Facilities is payable in cash and the facilities mature in November
2027 (in relation to the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility with contractually agreed uncommitted
extension options). As of December 31, 2022, €55 million were utilized under the Schaeffler Group
Revolving Facility, in the form of letters of credit. In connection with the Ewellix Acquisition, we drew
€350 million under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility on January 2, 2023 and we expect to
draw the remaining €150 million available under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility in March
2023 to replenish cash on hand used for the Ewellix Acquisition in January 2023. The Schaeffler
Group Revolving Facility is unsecured and not guaranteed by any of Schaeffler AG’s subsidiaries. For a
description of the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement, see “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Schaeffler Group—Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities_
_Agreement.”_

**_Non-recognized contingent liabilities and other obligations_**

As of December 31, 2022, we had contingent liabilities of €62 million, including €16 million in
contingent liabilities representing tax- and customs-related risks and €31 million in contingent
liabilities related to legal cases.

**_Pension Obligations_**

We grant our employees various types of pension benefits (comprising defined contribution and
defined benefit plans). The defined benefit pension obligations are primarily towards beneficiaries in
Germany, most of which are unfunded. In addition to the German pension plans, the most significant
defined benefit pension plans cover employees in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. In these


-----

countries, our pension obligations are financed by external pension funds with restricted access. As
of December 31, 2022, 98% of pension obligations in the U.S. and 133% of pension obligations in the
United Kingdom were covered by plan assets. These pension plans were closed to new entrants in
2006 (U.S.) and 2009 (United Kingdom) and replaced with defined contribution plans. As a result,
employees can no longer earn additional defined benefits.

As of December 31, 2022, the net defined benefit liability of €1,515 million comprises a defined
benefit obligation of €2,287 million net of the fair value of plan assets of €772 million. This is
presented in the statement of financial position as a provision for pensions and similar obligations of
€1,606 million as well as €91 million in plan assets of overfunded plans.

For further details regarding our pension obligations, see note 4.13 to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022.

_Dividend Policy of Schaeffler AG_

Schaeffler AG aims to balance the expectations of investors with regard to dividend payments with
the profit retention requirements of Schaeffler AG to secure its capital base and to support its
ambition for long-term continuity and value creation. Schaeffler AG intends to pay dividends in the
ordinary course of business of between 30% and 50% of the Schaeffler Group’s annual net income
before special items. However, there can be no assurance with respect to any given year that
Schaeffler AG will pay dividends in this amount or at all.

The holders of the non-voting shares benefit from preferred dividend payments of €0.01 per share. In
determining whether or not to declare a dividend, the Board of Managing Directors will take into
account its view of the general business environment and market conditions, the Schaeffler Group’s
operating results, its operating cash flow, its investment and capital management initiatives, its
future funding and financing requirements, its ambition to maintain a sound and solid capital
structure, taxation considerations, any contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of
dividends and any other factors that it may deem relevant.

In April 2022, we paid a dividend of €0.50 per non-voting share and €0.49 per voting share for the
fiscal year 2021, for a total dividend pay-out of €328 million to the shareholders of Schaeffler AG.
Dividends paid 2021 (for 2020) consisted of a dividend of €0.25 per non-voting share and €0.24 per
voting share, for a total dividend pay-out of €162 million. Dividends paid in 2020 (for 2019) consisted
of a dividend of €0.45 per non-voting share and €0.44 per voting share, for a total dividend pay-out
of €295 million to shareholders of Schaeffler AG. In the invitation to Schaeffler AG’s annual general
meeting of shareholders, which is scheduled to be held on April 20, 2023, the Board of Managing
Directors and the Supervisory Board have proposed a dividend for the fiscal year 2022 of €0.45 per
non-voting share and €0.44 per voting share, which, if approved, would amount to a total dividend
payout of €295 million.

_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

### Qualitative Disclosure on Market Risk

We are exposed to a number of financial risks arising from the ordinary course of business, such as
credit risks, interest rate risks and currency risks. See also “Financial risk management” in note 4.16
to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2022 included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our payment obligations as they come due.
Our approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that there is always sufficient liquidity available
to meet liabilities as they come due without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to our
reputation. We monitor and manage short-and medium-term liquidity risk using a rolling liquidity
budget with a forecasting period of up to fourteen months.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that we will incur a financial loss as a result of a default by a customer or
business partner. Credit risk arising on trade receivables is managed by continuously monitoring
customers’ financial status, creditworthiness and payment history. Additional measures we use to
manage credit risk include efficient collection procedures and the use of commercial credit insurance.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Due to our obligations under floating-rate debt instruments, such as the Schaeffler Group Revolving
Facility or the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility, we are, in principle, subject to an interest rate risk
relating to fluctuations in the EURIBOR. Our interest rate risk is presently not hedged with specific
instruments (e.g., interest rate swaps, caps and collars). Interest rate risk and the development of
interest rate markets are continually monitored and reported to our CFO.

**_Currency Risk_**

We are exposed to diverse foreign exchange risks due to our international presence. The focus on
hedging is on transaction risk, i.e., the impact from currency fluctuations on our future cash flow, and
financial risk, i.e., the impact from currency fluctuations on payments due under a portion of our
external financial debt denominated in a currency other than euro. The largest transaction foreign
currency risks result from exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. dollar and Chinese renminbi.
Potential foreign currency fluctuations have an effect on revenue as well as on purchase costs.

The following table sets forth the Schaeffler Group’s material currency risk exposures from
operations by currency based on face values as of December 31, 2022:

**As of December 31, 2022**

**USD** **CNY** **RON** **HUF** **INR**

Estimated currency risk from operations ................................. 765 597 (426) (168) 138

Forward exchange contracts .................................................... (667) (412) 198 108 (114)

**Remaining currency risk from operations ...............................** **98** **185** **(228)** **(60)** **25**

Foreign exchange risks are managed centrally by corporate treasury, using various hedging
instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and options. Specific exchange rate exposures and
exchange rate effects on earnings are continuously monitored and evaluated as part of a regular
reporting program and risk management system.


-----

**_Energy Price Risk_**

Due to our energy-intensive industrial manufacturing activities, we are affected by energy price
fluctuations. In order to mitigate energy risks related to electricity and gas we use various
instruments, including forward contracts and short-, medium- and long-term fixed price and supply
contracts, such as power purchase agreements. Our energy related derivative financial instruments
did not qualify for the IFRS 9 own-use exemption in 2022.

The following table sets forth the Schaeffler Group’s material energy risk exposures from operations
based on nominal and face values as of December 31, 2022:

**As of December 31, 2022**

**Nominal value** **Fair value**

**Financial assets**

Forward energy contracts ..................................................................................................... 74 107

Power purchase agreements ................................................................................................. 10 2

**Financial liabilities**

Forward energy contracts ..................................................................................................... 5 0

Power purchase agreements ................................................................................................. 90 (12)

### Critical Accounting Principles

In the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, management exercises judgment
in making appropriate estimates and assumptions affecting the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Critical accounting principles are
those that (i) are relevant to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and
(ii) require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual amounts
may differ from these estimates.

As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the
uncertainties increase, those judgments become even more subjective and complex.

For a summary of factors affecting estimation uncertainty and management judgment, see note 1.2
and for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1.3 of the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022.

### Markets

We develop and manufacture high-precision components, systems and services for powertrains and
chassis, as well as rolling and plain bearing solutions for various industry applications. This includes
innovative and sustainable technologies for hybrid, electric and combustion-engine powered
vehicles. Our offering comprises solutions for automated and autonomous driving, components and
systems for rotary and linear motion, as well as services, maintenance products and monitoring
systems for a wide range of industrial applications. Our portfolio also includes OEM-quality repair
solutions and associated supporting services for the global automotive aftermarket.

### Automotive Technologies

We offer products to customers in the automotive sector. These customers include OEMs and their
suppliers (Tier 1 and Tier 2). Products range from E-Mobility solutions (such as electric motors,
electric axle transmissions, electric axle drives, power electronics, hybrid modules, electromechanical
and hydraulic actuators, components for fuel cells, and thermal management modules) to
components and systems for engines (such as valve-lash adjustment elements, variable valve train
systems, and camshaft phasing systems) to components and systems for transmissions (such as
solutions for double-clutch, manual, automated and automatic transmissions (for example, torque
converters, hybrid dampers and clutches)) to chassis components (such as wheel bearings and
mechatronic systems for active chassis, including for autonomous mobility) to bearings, which largely
powertrain agnostic and are utilized in many engine, transmission and chassis components and
systems, such as wheel bearings and needle rolling bearings.

**_Definition, Size and Structure_**

The global automotive OEM industry designs, develops, manufactures and sells light vehicles and
commercial vehicles. The light vehicle segment consists of passenger cars, vans and light trucks (all
weighing less than six tons), while the heavy and medium vehicle segment is generally defined as the
market for vehicles with a weight of more than six tons. In 2022, approximately 82 million light
vehicles were produced globally (Source: S&P Global Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Light Vehicle
Production Forecast (Base), January 2023]).

The automotive production value chain is broken down into OEMs, such as Daimler AG, Ford Motor
Company, Toyota Motor Corporation, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. Ltd and Volkswagen AG, and
automotive part suppliers, such as the Schaeffler Group, BorgWarner Inc., Continental AG, Vitesco
AG, Valeo S.A., and ZF Friedrichshafen AG. The automotive part supplier market is further segmented
into three different tiers. Tier 1 suppliers produce technologies, systems and solutions geared


-----

towards finished products and work directly with OEMs. Tier 2 suppliers produce specialized parts
and components and sell these products to Tier 1 suppliers, and Tier 3 suppliers provide raw
materials and other products. In general, suppliers develop components and systems on the basis of
agreements with OEMs to meet their technological and regulatory requirements.

**_Growth Drivers_**

In the OEM market, revenue of automotive suppliers is primarily driven by global light vehicle
production volume and the content per vehicle for the components and systems produced by such
suppliers. Although suppliers will have contracts for particular vehicle platforms, the actual
production volume is rarely fixed and may vary depending on macro and other contingent factors.
The economic environment is generally the most significant factor, regulations and government
policies (such as increasingly strict standards for CO2 emissions or buying incentives) increase
demand for products that help reduce pollutants and meet related standards. Other specific factors
that can influence automotive production include changing demographics (e.g., population growth,
increase of median age, urbanization), consumer preferences (e.g., low cost cars for basic
transportation), levels of disposable income, replacement rates of old vehicles and affordability of
new vehicles.

**_Key Trends_**

The automotive supply industry is influenced by a range of complementary trends, which together
influence the performance of the individual participants. The key trends are described below:

_Market Trends_

The automotive industry is currently impacted by a number of key market trends which are primarily
driven by regulations and technological developments, as well as changes in consumer demand.
These trends include:

  - **_Increased fuel efficiency, reduced CO2 emissions and E-Mobility: Tightening environmental_**
standards for vehicles globally are driving a need to develop more environmentally-friendly
technologies, aimed at lower fuel consumption and, consequently, at reduced CO2 emissions,
as well as lower tailpipe emissions (e.g. nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and CO2).
This can generally be achieved by enhancing the efficiency, or reducing the weight, of existing
technologies or by developing new alternative technologies. Powertrain and transmission
related technologies are expected to be critical for OEMs’ ability to comply with stricter
standards. Moreover, the increasing use of hybrid, electric and hydrogen powertrains
represents a fundamental change to established vehicle technology and related purchase
incentives and an expanding charging infrastructure, could contribute to an increase in
demand for hybrid and electric powertrains. Given our general R&D activities to further
advance the powertrain of internal combustion engines as well as our wide-ranging and
growing competence in solutions for hybrid and full-electric powertrains, we are well
positioned to further drive and benefit from this trend. Our joint venture Innoplate, with
Symbio SAS, itself a joint venture of Faurecia and Michelin hydrogen company, to produce fuel
cell bipolar plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global mobility and energy solutions and
our shared research program with Johnson Matthey, Bekaert and TNO, to accelerate proton
exchange membrane (“PEM”) electrolyzer technology development, by optimizing the most
important components of the electrolyzer stack, is expected to help us to continue to drive the
next generation of hydrogen technologies.

  - **_Enhanced comfort and convenience: OEMs are constantly looking for ways to enhance driving_**
experience, comfort and convenience through new technologies. Examples of this include the
significant increase in electronic components per vehicle, with many car functions now


-----

controlled electronically and solutions that improve driving experience, for example, through
noise and vibration control (e.g., dual mass flywheels, balancer shaft dampers and crankshaft
dampers).

  - **_Autonomous driving: An additional growing market will be autonomous driving, which, along_**
with increased driving comfort, will also improve road safety. Experts refer to five levels of
vehicle automation, beginning with level 0 with a “driver only” – the driver steers and drives
completely without support from driver assistance systems – through to level 5, in which the
vehicle is completely driverless, i.e. moves autonomously. Connectivity is also an important
aspect of autonomous driving. Sophisticated sensor, antenna and data connectivity
technologies work together to sense the environment, within and outside the vehicle, and
receive, act upon, and transmit data in real-time to devices throughout the vehicle and in the
physical world the vehicle navigates. Additionally, requirements for chassis applications are
evolving to match increased automation. We acquired Schaeffler ByWire, and its steer-by-wire
steering technology (“Space Drive”), a key technology for autonomous driving. Space Drive is
the only system of its kind to be licensed for on-road use in multiple countries worldwide.

  - **_Shared mobility and connectivity: Consumers, especially in urban centers, are increasingly_**
seeking alternative mobility concepts to vehicle ownership, such as, for example, mobility on
demand, mobility as a service or ride sharing. Such shared mobility concepts are linked, to a
certain degree, to the connectivity of vehicles. Connected cars are those that have access to
the internet and a variety of sensors, and that are able to send and receive signals, sense the
physical environment around them and interact with other vehicles or entities. Increasing
vehicle connectivity to smartphones, clouds, physical infrastructure and other vehicles, is
another market trend that affects both OEM and suppliers. A growing trend, for example,
involves the process of sending and installing software updates on passenger vehicles through
the internet (“over the air”).

  - **_Growth markets: The increase in disposable income, low existing vehicle penetration as well as_**
the development of efficient road infrastructure are driving demand for light vehicles in
growth markets. Due to high and rapidly growing local demand combined with low
manufacturing costs, global OEMs are expanding their production and sales networks in these
markets. At the same time, local vehicle manufacturers, particularly in China and India, are also
gaining significant scale. Large scale suppliers with strong OEM relationships and resources to
invest in their production footprint are well positioned to tap growth opportunities in these
markets, both with existing and new local OEM customers.

Suppliers that provide solutions that enable OEMs to address these trends and meet regulatory
standards are well positioned to experience above average growth and establish themselves as key
future technology partners for OEMs. For a long time, the Automotive Technologies Division has
primarily competed with other large automotive suppliers in the fields of drive technology and
chassis systems. In the future-oriented fields of electric mobility and autonomous driving, additional
competitors new to the industry are entering the market.

_OEM Trends_

Changes in the development, sourcing and production strategy of OEMs can also influence the
automotive supplier market. Over the past decade, OEMs have increasingly shifted to global vehicle
platforms with the aim of maximizing the commonality of components and systems and to derive
cost savings via economies of scale. Consequently, OEMs are looking for global suppliers that can
provide standardized components worldwide, at a competitive cost level and with close proximity to
OEM production sites. Typically, OEMs use two to three suppliers globally per component and
platform to ensure a degree of multiple sourcing and in order to avoid overdependence on a single
supplier, though some OEMs use a single supplier. This trend benefits suppliers, such as the


-----

Schaeffler Group, with global presence and scale, and the ability to deliver the same
technological/quality standard at competitive costs across regions. In addition, OEMs have increased
investments in the context of E-mobility, in particular in the field of battery capacity.

### Automotive Aftermarket 

We offer products and services to customers in the automotive aftermarket sector. Products and
services are sold via two primary distribution channels: the original equipment service (“OES”) and
the open (independent) spare parts market or independent aftermarket (“IAM”). The OES
distribution channel supplies original spare parts to automobile OEMs for their branded repair shops.
The IAM distribution channel supplies components and repair solutions and services to a global
network of independent parts distributors, which supply workshops that are not affiliated with any
particular automobile OEM. IAM differentiates between two types of business, a traditional
components business consisting of replacing parts and a business for the development and
distribution of custom assembled repair sets and kits to help make vehicle repairs simple, efficient
and professional.


-----

**_Definition, Size and Structure_**

The term “aftermarket” refers to the market of spare parts that are used in the maintenance and
repair of passenger cars and commercial vehicles. In addition to sales to OEMs for their own
production, many automotive suppliers sell directly to the aftermarket, representing a smaller but
typically more profitable and stable revenue source. The same products supplied to OEMs are
generally also distributed in the aftermarket sector.

**_Growth Drivers_**

In the aftermarket, the key drivers for growth are (i) continuing growth in the global vehicle
population, (ii) an overall increase in the average age of the vehicle population, and (iii) increasing
vehicle complexity. Especially in growth markets like China, there is significant potential for growth in
the automotive aftermarket business, given the increase in vehicle population over the past years
that is expected to continue and the number of vehicles in the seven to ten year age range is
expected to increase significantly and approach the level of Europe as early as by 2024 (Source: S&P
Global Mobility © [S&P Global Mobility Vehicle in Operation (VIO) Forecast, November 2022]). The
growth of the IAM business depends on a number of different factors, both in terms of demand (e.g.,
average age and composition of vehicles on the road, mileage and technological development of
vehicles) and in terms of the range of products and services offered. The Automotive Aftermarket
Division considers itself very well positioned within this market, as demonstrated by the numerous
awards and certifications our products and services have received, but at the same time, the
Automotive Aftermarket Division is preparing for future challenges, especially those arising from the
move toward new vehicle technologies and digitalization.

The Automotive Aftermarket believes its cross-selling activities, i.e. expanding the product portfolio
with existing customers, to hold potential for additional revenue. Together with industry partners,
the Division is also working to promote the issue of vehicle connectivity and non-discriminatory
access to data and is actively involved in the digital data marketplace CARUSO and related activities.

**_Key Trends_**

Increasingly complex vehicle applications, the large number of new vehicle models and the
emergence of next generation vehicle technology, such as powertrain electrification, autonomous
driving and connectivity, are constantly confronting repair shop staff with challenging repair
situations. Therefore, suppliers to the automotive aftermarket offer numerous services and repair
solutions. As hybrid and electric vehicles are increasingly in need of repairs, the Automotive
Aftermarket Division is focusing on developing intelligent repair solutions and services for electric

& Canada, South America, Mexico), Greater China (including Mainland China, also Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao) and Asia/Pacific (South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia and India). In addition to the
traditional core markets in Europe (41.5% of our consolidated revenue in 2022) and the Americas
(22.3% of our consolidated revenue in 2022), our business in the Greater China and Asia/Pacific
regions, which accounted for 22.8% and 13.4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue in 2022,
has contributed significantly to our overall growth in recent years. In particular, despite the
significant decline in 2020 revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues in the Greater
China Region increased by 6.8% in 2020. Following our integrated “as regional as possible” approach,
we have built a global manufacturing footprint with each of our plants having a strong regional
foothold. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 44 plants in Europe, 13 in the Americas, ten in
Greater China and nine in Asia/Pacific. Nearly all of our plants are certified under globally recognized
quality norms, standards, and regulations. In addition, as part of the Ewellix Acquisition in January
2023, we acquired six additional manufacturing and customization sites in Europe, the U.S. and Asia
(please note that the Ewellix Group sites are not consolidated with the Schaeffler Group plants for
purposes of the discussions of the latter in this Offering Memorandum).

### Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the following competitive strengths have been the primary drivers of our success in
the past and will continue to set us apart from our competitors in the future:

**_German Precision Engineering and Manufacturing Company with Strong Global Positions across_**
**_Portfolio Based on Quality and Technology_**

We have a long tradition of precision engineering and manufacturing expertise, particularly in the
area of high-precision mechanical components and systems. This expertise has enabled us to gain
leading positions across our core customer sectors: two-wheelers, passenger cars & light commercial
vehicles, truck & bus, offroad, rail, aerospace, raw materials, industrial automation, power
transmission, and wind. Based on our research, we believe we are among the leading companies in
the engine, transmission, chassis systems and E-mobility sectors, and in particular in engine valve
train components, dual mass flywheels, ball screw drives for electrical power steering and electric
drive solutions. Being a partner to manufacturers of passenger cars and commercial vehicles, the
Automotive Technologies Division is actively involved in shaping technological change in the industry
via its R&D activities and expects that in 2035, approximately 60% of all passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles will have all-electric drive systems and approximately 30% will have a hybrid
powertrain (a combination of an electric motor and an internal combustion unit), and also by 2035,
approximately 10% of passengers cars and light commercial vehicles manufactured will be driven in a
highly automated manner and approximately 15% in a partly automated manner. The R&D activities
of the Automotive Technologies Division are aimed at developing and expanding its expertise with
respect to mechatronic applications and systems for efficient, low-emission, and electrified
powertrains, as well as autonomous driving and strengthening the profitability and efficiency of its
extensive existing expertise in the field of mechatronics and mechanical systems. We believe our
Automotive Aftermarket Division is very well positioned within the market, particularly in the Europe
and Americas regions, offering all-in-one solutions with components in original equipment quality for


-----

a safe and proper vehicle repair. In our Industrial Division, high-quality components and an
understanding of how they interact within a system are fundamental to success in the systems
business and our “Lifetime Solutions” products offer comprehensive services in the age of
digitalization. For that reason, the Division is strengthening its existing extensive expertise in the
fields of mechatronics and mechanical systems and is also enhancing it with respect to mechatronic
systems and digitalization solutions. We support OEMs throughout their full product lifecycle, from
taking part in the early stages of product development to providing critical engineering application
know-how, and are therefore regarded as a key partner.

Quality and reliability are the key attributes of our products and services, as many of our products
are mission-critical to the performance, durability and safety of the equipment in which they are
installed. As our products are critical to the overall performance, safety and durability of the endproduct and generally represent only a small percentage of the overall costs of the end-product, the
primary criteria for purchasing decisions by our customers are quality and technological excellence
rather than price alone. Providing superior product quality to our customers is therefore key to our
business model and paramount to our success. A holistic quality management system in all of our
locations, including all manufacturing plants worldwide, has been designed to ensure compliance
with our high quality standards, which are monitored by means of regular internal audits. With
various quality assurance programs, and our comprehensive quality culture, as well as testing and
simulation processes, mostly developed in-house, we emphasize our goal of achieving zero-defect
quality for the entire supply chain worldwide, and we believe that we achieve failure rates that are
significantly lower than the industry average.

Our commitment to the highest industry quality standards and technological prowess are underlined
by the numerous awards and certifications our products and services have received, including
multiple awards from major automobile OEMs such as Volkswagen, Volvo, Ford, Nissan, Toyota and
General Motors and over 50 quality awards since 2020. In 2022, we received the Red Dot Best of the
Best Award in the category “Design Concept,” the Magna Supplier Award, we were a finalist for the
European Association of Automotive Supplier’s (CLEPA) Innovation Award in the category “Clean and
Sustainable Mobility” and were nominated for the 2022 German Innovation Award. In 2021, we
received Red Dot Design Awards in the two categories “Smart Product” and “Industrial Design,” a
Railsponsible Supplier Award in the category “Climate Change and Circular Economy,” the
Automotive News PACE E-Mobility award and its Innovation Partnership award, a Best Practice
Award from Rolls-Royce, the Golden Steering Wheel Award from the car magazine “AUTO BILD”
together with our collaboration partner Ford Motor Co. and the “Smart Technology Innovation of the
Year” award at the 2021 ASEAN Wind Future Awards.

**_Well Positioned for Structural Change in our Key Markets Based on our Strong Technology_**
**_Competence and Investments in Innovation_**

We consider our technology competence and our strong system integration capabilities to be among
our key competitive advantages. Our product innovations have formed the backbone of our success
for many decades, and we continuously invest in our products, services and processes to protect our
market positions. Our worldwide R&D capabilities include approximately 7,400 R&D staff at 20 R&D
centers and additional R&D locations in a total of 25 countries that are developing new products,
customer product applications, technologies, processes and methods for market-driven solutions. On
average over 2020, 2021 and 2022, we spent 5% of our consolidated revenue on R&D to continuously
improve our products and to position us at the forefront of our industry in terms of innovation and
quality of design. Our strong innovative ability is illustrated by the number of our patent applications
in recent years. With 1,266 patent registrations in 2022, we ranked fourth among Germany’s most
innovative companies according to the German Patent and Trademark Office (Deutsches Patent- und
_Markenamt, DPMA). In total, as of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 22,900 patents and_
patent applications.


-----

We believe that our focus on innovation, quality, system understanding, and high-precision
manufacturing positions us well to address the key trends that we expect to influence our business in
the future: sustainability & climate change, new mobility & powertrain electrification, autonomous
production, the data economy and digitalization and demographic change. In particular, European
legislation limiting CO2 emissions cause OEMs to focus on the optimization of efficiency, friction
reduction and valve train variability for conventional powertrains.

In the automotive sector, systems for electric axels and hybrid drive systems, autonomous driving,
connectivity and new mobility solutions as well as efficient internal combustion engines, automated
transmissions, are expected to be the main drivers of future growth. In 2022, we inaugurated our
new center of competence in software and electronics development in Pune, India and we began the
expansion of our E-mobility development and manufacturing campus in Buehl, Germany, to add a
new center of excellence for E-mobility. In 2021, we opened our new E-mobility plant in
Szombathely, Hungary. The plant is our first production plant worldwide dedicated to E-mobility and
it is a center for excellence for components and systems for electrified powertrains. Our Chassis
System BD also entered into a partnership with Mobileye B.V., a subsidiary of the Intel Group, which
will enable us to offer an autonomous, flexible, and adaptable vehicle platform based on Mobileye’s
technology.

In the industrial sectors, we believe that in particular the increasing demand in wind and other
renewable forms of energy as well as in the power transmission and industrial automation customer
segments, will drive future growth. In the course of 2021, we introduced our comprehensive and
automated condition monitoring solution “OPTIME,” which makes condition monitoring efficient,
easy to use and cost-effective across all indirectly process-critical assets for entire machine and
equipment parks. Since its introduction, OPTIME has been implemented in more than 170 customer
plants and 37 of our own plants. See “Industry—Industrial—Historical and Forecast Market
_Development” and “—Our Divisions—Industrial Division—Strategic Business Areas” and “Industry—_
_Industrial—Historical and Forecast Development.”_

We believe that in many of these areas we are a frontrunner, and we have recently made selective
acquisitions and entered into joint ventures to further strengthen our production and product
spectrum and to expand our technological expertise. For example, in 2021, we expanded the services
offering of our Industrial Division when we acquired Bega, a manufacturer of special tools for
mounting and dismounting roller bearings. In 2022, we acquired Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives
GmbH, formerly Melior Motion GmbH (“Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives”) and a manufacturer of
innovative precision gearboxes for industrial robots, we acquired the remaining interest in Schaeffler
ByWire, which develops and sells the steer-by-wire steering technology “Space Drive,” a key
technology for autonomous driving. We also entered into our joint venture Innoplate, with Symbio
SAS, itself a joint venture of Faurecia and Michelin hydrogen company, to produce fuel cell bipolar
plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global mobility and energy solutions. In addition, we
acquired CERASPIN, a manufacturer of high-quality ceramic components for roller bearings used in a
wide range of strategic growth areas, including wind energy, rail, aerospace, medical equipment,
electrical engineering and the semiconductor industry. In January 2023, we acquired the Ewellix
Group, a manufacturer of innovative linear motion and actuation solutions used in assembly
automation, medical applications and mobile machinery.

Consistently increasing technological requirements lead to growing demand for our technologicallyadvanced products, as they are more and more integrated into the respective end-applications. This
has enabled us, in many cases, to increase the percentage of the value of our end customer’s product
that is composed of products we supply. Globally, we have been able to increase our content per
vehicle (i.e., the Schaeffler Group’s annual automotive revenues, excluding aftermarket revenues,
truck revenues and other revenues (e.g., tooling, R&D charges), divided by the respective number of
light vehicles produced per year) with a CAGR of approximately 4.4% from 2013 to 2022, despite the
COVID-19 pandemic. Given our technological expertise and our focus on and investment in


-----

innovation, we believe that we are well placed to benefit from the structural megatrends in the
markets that we serve and to transform our portfolio over time from a components supplier to a
complete systems supplier helping to shape progress that moves the world across the areas driving
growth of CO2-efficient drives, chassis applications, industrial machinery & equipment, renewable
energy and aftermarket solutions & services.

**_Resilience based on Diversified and Robust Business Portfolio, Structural Improvements and Cost_**
**_Flexibility_**

Our revenues are diversified across a wide range of bearings and automotive components and
systems and industrial products, generated by thousands of applications for customers across many
diverse end-markets. Within our Automotive Technologies and Automotive Aftermarket Divisions, we
sell approximately 61,100 products and system solutions to OEMs and the aftermarket sector. Within
our Industrial Division, which accounted for 27.0% of our consolidated revenue and 47.7% of our
Adjusted EBIT in 2022, we serve customers in a variety of different sectors, selling approximately
59,200 products and system solutions for a diverse range of applications ranging from wind turbines
to aerospace engines and tool machines. Our end markets are influenced by different economic
factors, making us less vulnerable to adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment or
fluctuations of a particular economic parameter affecting individual regions or market segments. For
example, our Industrial Division recorded a 19.7% increase in revenue in 2022 as compared to 2021
(prior year: 13.9%), despite the impacts of the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, rising inflation and
the semiconductor shortage, which negatively affected vehicle production and therefore demand for
products of our other Divisions. In addition, the wind sector cluster of our Industrial Division
recorded significant revenue increases in the first half of 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic which
resulted in revenue declines in other parts of our business. We also believe that being an integrated
automotive and industrial supplier provides us with significant synergies potential. There are many
overlaps between the different business areas of our Divisions, such as the use of the same materials
and components, the application of the identical production technologies, and the joint purchasing of
raw materials, and we intend to focus even more closely on realizing cross-divisional economies of
scale as well as economies of scope going forward.

Our customer base is also diversified. Our products are sold to OEMs, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers,
aftermarket distributors and service providers in a variety of different sectors. Tier 1 suppliers
produce technologies and solutions geared towards finished products and work directly with OEMs.
Tier 2 suppliers produce specialized parts and components and sell these products to Tier 1 suppliers,
and Tier 3 suppliers provide raw materials and other products. Our key customers include top-tier
OEMs in the global automotive sector as well as leading industrial OEMs. As of December 31, 2022,
we sold our products to all major automotive manufacturers as well as approximately 1,100
automotive suppliers and approximately 5,800 industrial customers in approximately 130 countries
worldwide. In 2022, the Automotive Technologies Division’s top ten customers represented 64.8% of
its revenues, the Automotive Aftermarket’s top ten customers represented 29.5% of its revenues and
the Industrial Division’s top ten customers represented 18.5% of its revenues. We believe this
diversification mitigates counterparty risk and is broader than that of most of our peers.

Our products are often part of platforms that are in service for several years, thereby requiring
continuous aftermarket support and providing a robust revenue stream. In 2022, revenue of our
Automotive Aftermarket Division accounted for 12.9% of our consolidated revenue and 24.4% of our
Adjusted EBIT. In addition, we also generate significant revenue from our industrial aftermarket
business.

Our diversified and high-quality product offering, our focus on our strong positions in our regions and
product segments, our technology and innovation leadership and our proximity to and entrenchment
with our diversified customer base have brought robustness to our sales, with our Automotive
Technologies and Automotive Aftermarket Divisions’ sales volumes having developed better than


-----

underlying automotive production since 2015, with higher growth rates during cyclical upturns and
greater robustness during periods of challenging market conditions including during the COVID-19
pandemic and the geopolitical and economic challenges of 2022. Our ability to pass on a significant
portion of the price increases for nearly all of the input materials key to our operations helped to
mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, rising inflation, the semiconductor
shortage and other challenges in 2022 and protect our margins, particularly in our Industrial and
Automotive Aftermarket Divisions.

Our high degree of diversification, combined with the effects of various structural measures focused
on sustainable efficiency and profitability improvements that we implemented as part of our ongoing
efficiency and portfolio optimization divisional subprograms, and specific cost-efficiency measures
we implemented in early 2020 in response to the declining demand as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, helped to mitigate its impact on our business and return us to profitability quickly. In
2020, following a challenging first three quarters, we recorded positive EBIT and net income of €270
million and €100 million in the fourth quarter, and we reported positive Adjusted EBIT and cash flows
from operating activities in each quarter, except the second one. In 2021, at €1,266 million, our
Adjusted EBIT returned to pre-COVID-19 levels (Adjusted EBIT for 2019 was €1,161 million) and our
Adjusted EBIT margin of 9.1% in 2021 surpassed that of 8.1% in 2019. (Effective as of January 1, 2022,
we changed our accounting policy for operating assets (see the notes to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements 2022). EBIT and related figures in this paragraph have not been adjusted
retrospectively and may, therefore, not be fully comparable to the figures for subsequent periods.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the
_Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Comparability—Accounting Policy Changes.”)_

**_Strong Production Competence and Broad Global Manufacturing Footprint_**

We consider the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and processes to be one of our strengths.
We focus on lean manufacturing and continuous improvement and are seen as a reliable partner
with a high level of value added for our customers. In recent years, our expertise in special machinery
construction for digitized, automated and modular production facilities, originally developed as part
of the Technology and Innovation sub-program, has progressed from the development of innovative
production technologies for our own production to become an independent business unit with
external business in 2022.

In addition, we believe that our outstanding know-how in materials, such as steel, our know-how in
surface technology and cold forming technology, our low-cost precision manufacturing processes and
our attention to quality and service are competitive advantages that allow us to consistently provide
high-quality precision products and services. We design and manufacture a number of our tools inhouse and this provides us with unique know-how regarding high-precision manufacturing processes.
Furthermore, we perform most quality-related work in-house, which is designed to ensure that our
products maintain a consistently high standard of quality, as demonstrated by the numerous quality
awards we have won from our customers. We operate 20 R&D centers which focus on creating
proprietary products and systems and provide unique manufacturing know-how to our production
and manufacturing locations.

Our production competence and superior product quality are reinforced by our global manufacturing
footprint, which forms the foundation of our operations and as of December 31, 2022 included 76
plants in 22 countries worldwide, which are characterized by a high level of vertical integration. In
addition, as part of the Ewellix Acquisition in January 2023, we acquired six additional manufacturing
and customization sites in Europe, the U.S. and Asia (please note that the Ewellix Group sites and
employees are not consolidated with the Schaeffler Group plants and employees for purposes of the
discussions of the latter in this Offering Memorandum). Moreover, we have built a geographically
diversified global footprint while ensuring that each of our plants and facilities has a strong regional


-----

foothold, is in close geographic proximity to our customers, and benefits from cost-efficient just-intime logistics. As a result, we are perceived as a local supplier in many markets, and our global
manufacturing and sales platforms allow us to market our products and services to a larger and everglobalizing customer base. Our global footprint, with close proximity to our customers and many of
our suppliers, also reduces complexity of our supply and delivery logistics and helps mitigate the risk
of disruptions in our deliveries to customers and supply chain. Our position as one of the largest
global mechanical components and systems manufacturers further allows us to capitalize on the
growth opportunities associated with globalization and increasing international trade flows, while
making us less susceptible to market risks in any single country or region.

As a result of our global presence, we believe we are very well positioned in our key growth markets,
in particular in the Greater China region, where we have been present for decades.

**_Strong Management Combining Deep Industrial Expertise_**

Our management team has extensive experience in the automotive and industrial sectors and a
proven track record of successfully managing global businesses through economic cycles, including
the economic downturn in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and the global financial crisis,
and of implementing efficiency and cost reduction measures, such as in our Industrial Division, which
helped improve the Adjusted EBIT margin of the Industrial Division from 7.3% in 2016 to 11.7% in
2022. The successful CORE realignment program improved the efficiency and competitive position of
our Industrial Division by realigning its structure towards stronger customer orientation and
streamlining its leadership structure and the efficiency and portfolio optimization divisional
subprograms and the cost savings measures our management implemented in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic helped us through the difficulties of the COVID-19 pandemic and return us to
profitability quickly. Our management team has also demonstrated its ability to achieve long-term
profitable growth and establish the Schaeffler Group as one of the technology, quality and innovation
leaders in the industry.

Our well-established investor relations and treasury functions have significant capital markets
experience and a superior financing track record that includes many successful bond issuances since
2012 and Schaeffler AG’s IPO and listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2015.

### Strategy 

Our vision is to be the automotive and industrial supplier of choice that leads through innovation,
agility and efficiency. To pursue this vision, and building on our specific capabilities and competitive
advantages of innovation, quality, system understanding and manufacturing excellence, we have
established the Roadmap 2025, which sets our strategic direction and defines an integrated program
of measures within and across our three Divisions.

**_Our Strategic Focus Areas_**

Based on five future trends that we expect to have strong impacts on our business and that we
consider strategic opportunities for our future success – sustainability and climate change, new
mobility and electrified powertrain, autonomous production, data economy and digitalization, and
demographic change – we have determined five areas that we intend to focus our strategic efforts
on:

  - _CO2-Efficient Drives: In the context of increasing environmental awareness and the associated_

efforts to decarbonize, supported by various laws and regulations, CO2-efficient drives play an
important role in our automotive business. Based on our profound system understanding up to
the whole-of-vehicle level, we can supply components and systems for all types of powertrains
in order to develop and implement CO2-efficient powertrain solutions together with our
customers. In addition to our current product portfolio, which ranges from solutions for


-----

combustion engines and hybrid solutions to fully electric drive systems, we want to
systematically develop our fuel cell expertise from components and stacks through to systems.
As an important step in this direction, we entered into the joint venture Innoplate, with
Symbio SAS, itself a joint venture of Faurecia and Michelin hydrogen company, to produce fuel
cell bipolar plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global mobility and energy solutions.
Innoplate is expected to begin large-series production of bipolar plates in 2024, with an initial
production capacity of 4 million bipolar plates per year and the goal to increase production to
around 50 million bipolar plates per year by 2030. We also believe that hydrogen technology
will become important for applications in our industrial business. In addition, we have
developed a 4-in-1 electric powertrain business, which expands on our 2-in-1 and 3-in-1
electric powertrain offerings to add thermal management to the combined transmission,
electric motor and power electronics. We have also entered into a new market segment for
the electrification of heavy duty vehicles, for which we can utilize the same production
machinery that we have developed for light vehicles.

- _Chassis Applications: Developments in chassis applications are driven by the trend towards_

new forms of mobility and the progressive automation of driving functions towards
autonomous driving. We are intensifying our activities at the component and system level,
especially with regard to reliability and safety. This includes the consistent further
development of vehicle components as well as the development of innovative steer-by-wire
solutions for volume production. In addition to innovative chassis applications for the
automotive business, we also focus on autonomous vehicles in the logistics or transport sector.

- _Industrial Machinery and Equipment: With a view to increasing autonomous production, we_

want to offer our customers innovative mechatronic systems for the growing robotics market,
building on and expanding our existing product offering, such as our high-performance and
precise robotic arm actuators, which feature compact electric motor technology based on a
printed circuit board (PCB), coated sensors and low friction bearings with high wear resistance.
As an important step in this direction, we recently acquired the Ewellix Group, a manufacturer
of innovative linear motion and actuation solutions used in assembly automation, medical
applications and mobile machinery and Schaeffler Ultra Precision Drives, a manufacturer of
innovative precision gearboxes for industrial robots. In addition to robotics, we intend to
continue our focus on conventional components for rotary or linear applications.

- _Renewable Energy:_ Against the background of major climate challenges, the global demand for

renewable energy is growing. As a partner to the energy industry, we want to continue to
support the expansion of regenerative energy generation, building further on our
comprehensive portfolio of products that make energy generation from renewable resources
more economical, such as bearings for wind power turbines (with two-thirds of all wind
turbines globally including Schaeffler products, based on our internal estimates) to solutions
for the solar and hydroelectric sectors. This focus area is also an essential part of our
sustainability strategy.

- _Aftermarket Solutions & Services:_ Given the advances being made in autonomous production,

new mobility concepts, vehicle connectivity and the trend towards an increasing data economy
and digitalization, services are becoming an increasingly important part of our offering. In the
industrial space, our customers benefit from our growing portfolio of cost-efficient monitoring
and service solutions (IoT) for broad range of plant and machinery assets, while the increasing
technical complexity and connectivity of vehicles is driving demand for innovative repair
solutions in the automotive sector and the development of new business models and support
services. With the addition of data-based services and innovative plug & play repair solutions
to our portfolio, we are continuing our transition from a components supplier to a provider of
systems and integrated solutions. In addition, we want to offer our customers holistic


-----

solutions, including access to in-vehicle data, through various industrial partnerships within the
automotive aftermarket ecosystem.


-----

**_Implementing Our Strategy_**

As an integral part of our Roadmap 2025 we have developed an execution program, entitled Strategy
2025, to coordinate the implementation of our strategy. Reflecting our organizational and leadership
structure, the Strategy 2025 comprises subprograms for each of our three Divisions as well as four
cross-divisional subprograms.

_Divisional Strategy Programs_

Our Automotive Technologies Division, is focusing its growth efforts on accelerating the portfolio
shift to E-mobility and a successful transition to new and CO2-efficient powertrain and chassis
technologies, in close collaboration with our customers. For this purpose, we plan to invest in the
development of innovative components and systems for new engine technologies, fuel cells, hybrid
and electric drive systems and chassis technologies. As part of this strategy, we commissioned our
first production plant worldwide dedicated to E-mobility in 2021, to manufacture components and
systems, such as electric motors and hybrid drives and it is center for excellence for components and
systems for electrified powertrain. In 2022, we began the expansion of our E-mobility development
and manufacturing campus in Buehl, Germany, to add a new building complex that will serve as a
new center of excellence for E-mobility.

Our Automotive Aftermarket Division is focused on maintaining its high profitability by extending its
digital and service offering, introducing new repair solutions and opening up new ways to the market,
including by establishing new digital sales channels. We also seek to address industry trends, such as
increasing consolidation of distribution partners, changes in the competitive environment, growing
complexity in vehicle technology and a shift from individual components towards customer-oriented
repair solutions and services, by improving our competitiveness, extending our skill base and applying
new business models. In line with this strategy, in 2022, the Automotive Aftermarket Division
launched the first electric axel repair solution “E-Axle RepSystem-G.” The system is scalable and the
Division is developing additional repair solutions based on the system, for example, for electric
motors.

Our Industrial Division is focused on strengthening its leading position in bearings solutions and to
develop and entering new and profitable growth fields, including through the increased use of new
digital and mechatronic technologies. In order to meet our strategic priority of innovation, we strive
to win a key position in the condition monitoring sector and robotics, and we aim to harness
opportunities for our business along the hydrogen production and use chain. The Industrial Division
also aims to make sustainable profitability contributions across the Division and achieve higher
operative value generation over the whole value chain. As part of this strategy, in 2022, we acquired
CERASPIN, a manufacturer of high-quality ceramic components for roller bearings used in a wide
range of strategic growth areas, including wind energy, rail, aerospace, medical equipment, electrical
engineering and the semiconductor industry. In January 2023, we acquired the Ewellix Group, a
manufacturer of innovative linear motion and actuation solutions used in assembly automation,
medical applications and mobile machinery. In addition, in 2022, we entered into a twelve year
partnership with Rolls-Royce through which Rolls-Royce is securing their rolling bearing supply chain
through 2035 and we are making an important step in our growth initiative by supporting Rolls-Royce
with innovative products, R&D excellence and manufacturing capacity.


-----

_Cross-Divisional Strategy Programs_

In addition to the strategic measures we are implementing on a divisional basis, we are also focusing
on four subprograms on a group-wide basis, across our Divisions:

  - _Innovation & Technology: We are strategically managing our product and technology_

innovations in order to strengthen further our position as a pioneer of sustainable mobility and
motion, and we focus our innovation activities on harnessing synergies across our Divisions.
We have defined specific innovation clusters, including hydrogen and energy transition, and
material and surface science, with a view to maintaining our technological competitive
advantage and successfully meeting customer needs through continuous innovation in the
relevant areas. See “—Our Functions—Research and Development.” We also seek to bring in
external perspectives by promoting an open collaboration with a global network of external
partners, such as the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the Nanyang Technological
University (“NTU”), including the opening of a laboratory at NTU in May 2022 to undertake
research in the pioneering areas of robotics and digitalization, and our becoming an anchor
partner to STARTUP AUTOBAHN, an innovation platform which brings together more than 30
partners and 30,000 start-ups with the objective of developing new technologies to
marketability. In 2022, we also began a research program with Johnson Matthey, Bekaert and
TNO to accelerate proton exchange membrane (“PEM”) electrolyzer technology development,
by optimizing the most important components of the electrolyzer stack and a collaboration
with the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, operated by the German Aerospace Center
(DLR), to accelerate the development of application-oriented solutions in robotics. We are also
focused on using our significant skills in scaling up to industrial production to get promising
innovations to market quickly and in large unit numbers.

  - _Digitalization & IT: We focus on reshaping our processes for the digital age through data-_

driven knowledge acquisition and state-of-the-art IT solutions and on closer internal and
external collaborations between our employees, customers, and business partners. As data is
becoming an ever more important part of our economic ecosystem, we seek to promote the
end-to-end digitalization and automation of our processes and implementation of a robust,
cross-divisional, fully synchronized, and future-proofed IT landscape. We are also aiming to
provide future-ready process, data, and IT solutions for our human resources, finance and R&D
functions and our operations, including by enhancing and optimizing our shared service center,
to promote increased efficiency and flexibility. To this end, digitalization experts from all
business and IT departments work together on evaluating the latest digital technologies and
market trends in terms of opportunities and risks, identifying profitable digital solutions for
Schaeffler and carrying them forward in a sustainable and value-focused manner.

  - _People & Culture: We are emphasizing our focus on a high-performance culture through the_

implementation of newly designed remuneration systems that are rigorously focused on
quantitative targets and are encouraging an appreciative and performance-oriented leadership
style and support for employees through measures aimed at modern personnel development
and collaboration as well as even greater diversity within our workforce.

  - _Sustainability & Engagement: We are embedding environmental and social responsibility in_

our value chain as a central success factor for sustainable business operations and are
determined to support our customers in meeting their sustainability obligations. We have also
developed and incorporated a dedicated climate action plan to support the implementation of
measures required to achieve climate neutrality.


-----

**_Our Approach to Capital and Portfolio Management_**

Through our investment and capital allocation framework we seek to drive consistent capital
deployment and shift R&D spending to new technologies and future growth areas. In this context, we
categorized our businesses as either “mature” or “new” and then further divided those into four
portfolio strategies based on growth potential and return on capital employed: “build” and “grow”
for our new businesses and “harvest” and “exit/divest” for our mature businesses. For our “build”
and “grow” businesses, we plan with a reinvestment rate, defined as the ratio of capital expenditures
to depreciation and amortization, of significantly above 1.0, to fuel growth. Those businesses
categorized as “harvest” and “exit/divest” only receive the required capital to sustain cash
generation. In this way, we actively manage our portfolio with the goal of ensuring profitability in
mature businesses and strong growth in new businesses.

Particularly in the Automotive Technologies Division we will increasingly distinguish between mature
business and new business in the future, as the transformation towards innovative powertrain and
chassis technologies progresses. In our mature businesses, we are “harvesting” profitable enablertechnologies for the powertrain agnostic automotive bearings market, and optimized combustion
engines and “exiting/divesting” expiring businesses, reducing complexity, and consolidating our
footprint in Europe with a focus on Germany. Among our “mature” businesses, we have divested our
stake in Bio-Hybrid GmbH, which developed a four-wheel pedelec bike, known as the “Bio-Hybrid”
and sold our global chain drive business. In our new businesses, particularly to further enhance our EMobility BD products and services and our Chassis Systems BD products and services, we are
“growing” in electrified powertrains, fuel cells and chassis mechatronics and “building” competencies
in electrified powertrains and hydrogen. We have developed a 4-in-1 electric powertrain business,
which expands on our 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 electric powertrain offerings to add thermal management to
the combined transmission, electric motor and power electronics. We have also entered into a new
market segment for the electrification of heavy duty vehicles, for which we can utilize the same
production machinery that we have developed for light vehicles.

We believe that hydrogen fuel cells offer a potential alternative to pure electric battery solutions,
which have disadvantages for the heavy duty vehicle segment, in particular for long-haul use, and will
become more relevant in 2025-2030. We have therefore launched a broad initiative on hydrogen to
explore the use of hydrogen fuel cells for various potential applications across all our Divisions,
efforts which we categorize as “build.” We plan to capitalize on our existing expertise, for example, in
manufacturing bipolar plates, to develop complete hydrogen fuel cell systems. In 2022, we entered
into our joint venture Innoplate, with Symbio SAS, itself a joint venture of Faurecia and Michelin
hydrogen company, to produce fuel cell bipolar plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global
mobility and energy solutions. Innoplate is expected to begin large-series production of bipolar plates
in 2024, with an initial production capacity of 4 million bipolar plates per year and the goal to
increase production to around 50 million bipolar plates per year by 2030. We also began a shared
research program with Johnson Matthey, Bekaert and TNO, in 2022, to accelerate proton exchange
membrane (“PEM”) electrolyzer technology development, by optimizing the most important
components of the electrolyzer stack. We also signed a letter of intent in 2022 with Lhyfe, a French
green hydrogen producer, for Lhyfe to construct and operate an industrial electrolysis plant on our
site in Herzogenaurach, Germany, with a capacity of up to 15 MW. We expect the plant to start
operations in 2025 and to supply our Herzogenaurach plant and other regional customers with
approximately 3.7 tons of green hydrogen daily. The agreement with Lhyfe also sets out a technology
partnership to promote the use of our electrolysis stacks.


-----

**_Our Focus on Profitable Growth_**

We pursue a strategy of mainly organic growth, based on our existing technological expertise and
innovation capabilities. With respect to external growth, we intend to focus on small bolt-on
acquisitions that either expand our technological expertise or strengthen our market position
(particularly in the areas of automotive aftermarket, chassis mechatronics, power electronics &
electronics manufacturing, hydrogen, Lifetime Solutions, mechatronics and systems and rotative and
linear components). In the evaluation and execution of acquisitions we intend to follow a disciplined
approach with clear guidelines, including, among others, that acquired businesses must be earnings
accretive within one year of their integration and their return on capital employed must be greater
than their working average cost of capital within two years.

On the basis of our investment and capital allocation framework we have defined 12 growth
initiatives to express the focus of our growth efforts:

In our Automotive Technologies Division, these focus on E-drives for electric powertrains; customercentric electric axles for hybrid and electric powertrains, which are an important element of growth
in the E-mobility area; dedicated hybrid transmissions for hybrid powertrains, encompassing
innovative and efficient dedicated hybrid transmissions and hybrid modules; future engine
**_technologies for all powertrains, particularly in the context of electrified powertrains; and chassis_**
**_mechatronic solutions for assisted and automated mobility._**

In our Automotive Aftermarket Division, the growth initiatives focus on aftermarket wheel bearings
for passenger cars to be the one-stop shop for our customers; plug and play repair solutions for
**_garages to address the increased complexity of repairs and meet the demand for high-quality and_**
convenient repairs; and a transparent and user-friendly B2B platform developed by us that connects
manufacturers, dealers, and resellers of automotive parts in China (the “ETC Platform China”).

In our Industrial Division, the growth initiatives focus on large-size bearings for the wind industry to
offer our customers bearing solutions that meet the most rigorous requirements in terms of quality,
reliability, and durability; robotics for industrial automation to help shape the increasing automation
of industrial production with products such as our systems solutions for robotics; for both industrial
robots and “cobots” (collaborative robots), we intend to offer a broad product range, from
innovative bearing solutions to high-precision robotic arm joints and high-performance linear
actuators, thereby extending the application of robot technologies in work environments; and service
**_solutions for industrial applications, including a wide range of innovative condition monitoring and_**
lubrication solutions to increase plant availability and improve safety in the production environment.

As cross-divisional growth initiative across our Automotive Technologies and Industrial Divisions, we
intend to focus on hydrogen for automotive and industrial applications with areas of application
ranging from energy generation and storage to zero-emission drive solutions. We believe that our
core competences in material, forming, and surface coating technology will enable us to develop
efficient volume production for key components for the future hydrogen economy, along the entire
energy chain.

Geographically, we intend to continue to expand our presence in growth markets, for example in the
Greater China and the Asia/Pacific regions which have been growth drivers for all of our Divisions.
We expect the largest increase in both vehicle population and demand for repairs to occur outside of
Europe through 2025. To expand our presence in the Greater China and Asia/Pacific regions, we have
been opening or expanding local plants, such as the opening of a new production hall in Nanjing,
China and a large size bearing refurbishment center in India in 2021, a new manufacturing plant and
a new center for software and electronics development in in India in 2022, and we plan to expand
our campus in Taicang, China. In 2020, we started our ETC Platform China and, in 2021, we entered
into an agreement with Shanghai REFIRE Group Limited to cooperate on the development and
manufacture of key components for hydrogen fuel cells in 2021.


-----

**_Our Focus on Sustainability_**

Sustainability is an anchor of our Roadmap 2025 strategy and means being economically successful
while at the same time assuming responsibility for the environment and society.

While sustainability represents a significant component of our corporate values and is considered a
task of society as a whole, it is also an opportunity for business growth. A key example is the rapid
acceleration of electrification and a significant increase in battery and fuel cell powered vehicles. As a
global technology company, we are actively shaping the far-reaching transformation of mobility and
energy solutions. Together with our customers, we take a holistic approach to developing innovative
product solutions for the demands of the future, including climate-friendly energy generation and
alternative drives, intelligent repair solutions and new mobility concepts, and energy-efficient,
material and process optimized bearing technologies.

We strive to become a leader of innovation in E-mobility by offering our customers innovations and
development expertise in E-mobility on both a system and component level and products covering
many areas of electrification, from mild hybridization to all-electric driving. Our electric axle drives,
which entered into volume production in 2021, have set a new benchmark for the output density of
electric transmissions. We also began volume production of electric motors for hybrid modules,
hybrid transmissions, and all-electric axle drives in 2021. We also believe that hydrogen will play a
decisive role in fundamentally changing the entire energy and mobility sector and will become more
relevant from 2025 and are therefore focusing on it as a growth initiative across our Automotive
Technologies and Industrial Divisions. In 2022, we entered into our joint venture Innoplate, with
Symbio SAS, to produce fuel cell bipolar plates, a strategic fuel cell component, for global mobility
and energy solutions. Innoplate is expected to begin large-series production of bipolar plates in 2024,
with an initial production capacity of 4 million bipolar plates per year and the goal to increase
production to around 50 million bipolar plates per year by 2030.

We understand sustainability as a cross-functional task. With our Sustainability Strategy, we address
ten action fields such as climate neutrality, circularity and occupational health and safety. In 2022,
overall responsibility for sustainability within the Schaeffler Group was transferred to our Chief
Executive Officer. We also adopted a more decentralized and topic-specific decision-making
approach for sustainability issues and established a dedicated sustainability network across all
Divisions, functions and regions. We have also adopted group wide sustainability goals. With respect
to the environment, these goals address, among others, the increase in energy efficiency, the
purchase of renewable energies and climate-neutral production across all regions by 2030. And since
our commitment to sustainability is not confined to just the Schaeffler Group but extends to our
suppliers, we have also included the purchasing of production materials from suppliers with
sustainability self-assessments as one of our goals as well as climate-neutral production across all
regions, including the entire supply chain, by 2040. In 2022, the global non-profit Carbon Disclosure
Project (CDP), which is a leading environmental disclosure database and sets the standard for
corporate environmental disclosure transparency, awarded us the highest rating of “A” in the
categories of climate change and water security, recognizing our leadership in disclosure and
performance in those categories. For more information on our sustainability goal, see “—
_Environment, Social and Governance.”_

Our sustainability goals not only express our ambitions, but are also key tools for performance
measurement and management. Since 2020, the achievement of sustainability goals has been
integrated into the variable compensation of our top management team.

### Our History

In 1946, brothers Dr. Wilhelm Schaeffler and Dr. Georg Schaeffler founded Industrie GmbH in
Herzogenaurach, Germany. Lamellen- und Kupplungsbau GmbH (“LuK”) was founded in 1965 in
Buehl, Germany (in cooperation with Industrie-Nadellager (“INA”)), and later managed as a 50/50
joint venture. After the death of the founders (Dr. Wilhelm Schaeffler died in 1981 and Dr. Georg
Schaeffler died in 1996), Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann, Dr. Georg Schaeffler’s widow, and her
son Georg F. W. Schaeffler took charge of the family business to continue their life’s work and began
a number of initiatives to grow the Schaeffler Group’s expertise and scope as a technology partner. In
1999, LuK was fully integrated into the Schaeffler Group when it acquired the remaining 50.0%
interest in LuK. In 2001, INA acquired FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer AG (“FAG”), making the
Schaeffler Group the world’s second largest manufacturer of rolling bearings at that time. At the end
of 2002, INA, LuK, and FAG were combined to form the Schaeffler Group, under the motto “Together
we move the world.”

In July 2008, the Schaeffler Group initiated an acquisition of Continental AG via a public tender offer,
which was financed primarily by external debt. Following this acquisition, it focused on the gradual
improvement of its debt profile. In 2011, the Schaeffler Group took a key step in this direction, when
it significantly reduced its financial debt and achieved a considerable improvement of the terms and
conditions of its financing by selling part of its stake in Continental AG. In 2012, the Schaeffler Group
also debuted on the capital markets by completing its first ever bond offering. In 2014, the Schaeffler
Group and its shareholders completed the final stage of a multi-year corporate reorganization that
had been initiated in 2012 and was designed to establish a clean structure separating ownership of
Schaeffler Group from ownership in Continental AG.

In 2015, Schaeffler AG completed its initial public offering on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Following
its capital markets debut, the Schaeffler Group has focused on its internal processes. It modernized
its leadership structure by implementing the multi-dimensional matrix organization that comprises
the Board of Managing Directors and the executive board as well as realigning its regions. The
Schaeffler Group also continuously and significantly reduced its indebtedness.

Schaeffler AG’s non-voting shares have been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 2015 under
the ticker symbol SHA. The Issuer holds 75.1% of Schaeffler AG’s share capital (representing 100% of
its voting rights), with the remaining 24.9% (all non-voting shares) held by public investors.

### Our Divisions

We operate through three divisions, the Automotive Technologies Division, the Automotive
Aftermarket Division and the Industrial Division.

**_Automotive Technologies Division_**

Our Automotive Technologies Division partners with the global automotive industry in developing
and manufacturing components and system solutions for electric and hybrid powertrains and fuel cell
powertrains, as well as for internal combustion engines and chassis systems. The Division also offers
a wide range of rolling bearings that is largely powertrain-agnostic. Our Automotive Technologies
Division offers approximately 17,000 products and system solutions for E-Mobility, engines,
transmissions and chassis systems, as well as for hybrid and electric powertrain systems to customers
in the automotive sector. Alongside the increased development of technologies for low-emission and
emission-free powertrains, the Division also develops products for autonomous driving.

Our Automotive Technologies Division accounted for 60.1% of our consolidated revenue and 27.9%
of our Adjusted EBIT in 2022.


-----

_Customers_

As of December 31, 2022, we supplied our products and system solutions to all major global
automobile OEMs as well as approximately 1,100 automotive suppliers in the areas of passenger cars
as well as light, medium and heavy-duty trucks. In 2022, the Automotive Technologies Division’s
largest customer and its top ten customers represented 14.0% and 64.8% of its revenues,
respectively.

Customers are serviced and supplied by our worldwide sales organizations and production sites in all
regions.

_Products_

The Automotive Technologies Division comprises four business divisions (“BDs”), with a distinctive
product and service portfolio: (i) E-Mobility, (ii) Engine & Transmission Systems, (iii) Bearings, and
(iv) Chassis Systems, accounting for 14.2%, 54.2%, 27.6% and 3.9% of the Automotive Technologies
Division’s revenues during 2022. We changed the organizational structure of our Automotive
Technologies Division effective January 1, 2022 in order to more closely align the Division towards
future-oriented technologies and the transition in the automotive industry. Previously, the Division’s
four BDs were E-Mobility, Engine Systems, Transmission Systems and Chassis Systems. The
organizational change more clearly separates the powertrain-specific business from the powertrainagnostic business. The largely powertrain-agnostic range of rolling bearings applications and
products, that were previously part of the Transmissions Systems BD and the Chassis Systems BD, are
now part of the new Bearings BD. The change is intended to increase the visibility of the bearings
business as well as enhance it with a focus on applications and customers, realize synergies, drive
innovation and generate growth in new markets in a highly competitive environment. In addition, we
plan to grow on the E-Mobility and Chassis Systems BDs with a focus on their future core businesses.
For example, the Chassis Systems BD will concentrate on steering components, mechatronic chassis
systems, and technologies for autonomous driving and the E-Mobility BD established the “Project
House Thermal Management BEV,” in order to expand its market position in thermal management
for electric vehicles. We also combined the Engine and Transmission Systems BDs with the aim of
realizing additional synergies in the business with powertrains based on internal combustion engines,
in light of the long-term expectation of declining demand in this BD.

**_Automotive Aftermarket Division_**

Our Automotive Aftermarket Division complements the Automotive Technologies Division with an
extensive aftermarket offering and operates under the brands INA, FAG, LuK and REPXPERT. The
Division is continuing to evolve from a components supplier into a supplier of systems and integrated
solutions by adding data-based services and innovative plug-and-play repair solutions to its product
range. Products and repair solutions are distributed globally under these four product brands. The
product range covers applications in clutch and release systems, engine and transmission
applications and chassis applications. In addition, our Automotive Aftermarket Division offers a wide
variety of services, including, for example, various means of transferring knowledge, such as practiceoriented training courses, advice provided by our repair hotline or our online garage portal,
“REPXPERT,” and our product catalog and digital knowledge base, “medias,” as well as the
development of specialized tools for performing repairs such as “OneCode.” In September 2020, the
Automotive Aftermarket’s assembly and packaging center in Halle, Germany (the “AKO”)
commenced operations.

Our Automotive Aftermarket Division accounted for 12.9% of our consolidated revenue and 24.4% of
Adjusted EBIT in 2022.

The Automotive Aftermarket Division is primarily managed based on regions due to its broad
customer base and business structure. The Europe, Americas, Greater China and Asia/Pacific regions
operate as profit centers responsible for the Automotive Aftermarket business in their respective
markets.

In 2022, the Europe region accounted for 66.5%, the Americas region accounted for 21.3%, the
Greater China region accounted for 5.7% and the Asia/Pacific region accounted for 6.5% of the
Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenues.

Among our regions, we expect the Greater China region to experience the largest increase in vehicle
population and demand for repairs until 2025, as China’s vehicle population is both growing and
aging. Therefore, we are aiming to grow our Automotive Aftermarket Division’s business in the highvolume market in the Greater China region. To expand our presence in the Greater China region, we
are opening or expanding local plants and started our ETC Platform China to connect manufacturers,
dealers, and resellers of vehicle parts with each other, and, additionally to offer a comprehensive
range of parts for engines, transmissions and chassis. We aim to create and expand our product
portfolio of intelligently packaged repair solutions, products and services that are tailored to the
specific needs of the Greater China market.

_Customers and Sales_

As of December 31, 2022, we supplied our aftermarket products and system solutions to
approximately 2,100 customers globally. In 2022, the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s top ten
customers represented 29.5% of its revenues. The Automotive Aftermarket Division uses two primary
distribution channels within each of the four regions: the original equipment service (“OES”), which
accounted for approximately 20% of the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenues in 2022, and
the open (independent) spare parts market or independent aftermarket (“IAM”), which accounted


-----

for the remaining 80% of the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s revenues in 2022. The OES
distribution channel supplies original spare parts to automobile OEMs for their branded repair shops.
The IAM distribution channel supplies components and repair solutions and services to a global
network of independent parts distributors, which supply workshops that are not affiliated with any
particular automobile OEM. IAM differentiates between two types of business, a traditional
components business consisting of replacing parts and a business for the development and
distribution of custom assembled repair sets and kits to help make vehicle repairs simple, efficient
and professional. The Automotive Aftermarket Division operates through a global network of
distributors, many of whom are organized in trade cooperatives, and it utilizes tools such as a global
product and service platform and a returns portal. It is also continuing to develop its e-commerce
activities and relies on the close integration of marketing, distribution and services as online sales
evolve into an additional distribution channel for the Division. Also, in addition to its own services,
the Automotive Aftermarket Division has co-founded important service initiatives with industry
partners, a significant contribution to keeping repair shops and distributors well informed digitally.

The Automotive Aftermarket Division identified three fields of action to realize future growth: (i)
realizing potential in the core business, (ii) intensifying digitalization, and (iii) developing new
business.

Growth opportunities for the core business, particularly for expanding the share of portfolio with
existing customers (“Share of Wallet”), captures our view that the foundation for realizing
opportunities for growth, is to continually improve the customer experience and collaboration with
customers and partners and to ensure that interactions with our customers are as convenient for our
customers as possible.

Digitalization is also key to improving the customer experience across the entire sales process using
advanced digital services. For example, we developed the “OneCode” service solution that supports
repair shops throughout Europe to perform vehicle repairs by allowing them to scan a quick response
(QR) code placed on the packing of our products to receive information about repair solutions and
services and about the product itself, including its authenticity. In addition to on-site training, we also
began piloting REPXPERT Remote Support in Europe in 2021, enabling repair shops to obtain
assistance during complex repairs, including via smartphones or tablets, by sending images and
sound in real time and providing explanations of repairs via mixed reality. We also developed the ETC
Platform China, which is a trading platform in the independent spare parts market that is operated by
a supplier and links upstream and downstream sections of the supply chain and it allows us to
participate more in the expected growth in the Chinese aftermarket.

Developing new business focuses, in particular, on strengthening sustainability across the value
chain. This includes developing intelligent repair solutions and services for E-mobility, which will
enable the Division to capitalize on the growing need for repair solutions for hybrid and electric
vehicles. For example, in 2022, the Division launched the first electric axel repair solution “E-Axle
RepSystem-G.” The system is scalable and the Division is developing additional repair solutions based
on the system, for example, for electric motors. The Automotive Aftermarket will also focus on
services and solutions for the circular economy and remanufacturing. The Division will also consider
entering into partnerships and in the automotive ecosystem as it endeavors to provide added value
to repair shops. For example, we are actively involved in the digital market place “CARUSO”, a central
platform providing harmonized vehicle data to the automotive aftermarket and linking data suppliers
with data users.

Product lifetimes vary significantly from product to product. In addition to the traditional component
business consisting of replacement parts, the Automotive Aftermarket Division develops and
distributes custom repair sets and kits to help make vehicle repairs simple, efficient and professional.
For example, in 2022, the Automotive Aftermarket Division launched the first electric axel repair
solution “E-Axle RepSystem-G.” The system is scalable and the Division is developing additional repair
solutions based on the system, for example, for electric motors. The Automotive Aftermarket
Division is largely supplied by the plants of the Automotive Technologies Division. Our products and
repair solutions are distributed using the three product brands (i) LuK, (ii) INA and (iii) FAG and the
service brand, REPXPERT. Under the LuK brand, we provide intelligent repair solutions for
powertrains, including clutches, vibration damping or transmission components. Under the INA
brand, we offer a broad spectrum of products for key engine systems, including for the valve train,
timing drive, front end auxiliary drive and cooling systems. Under the FAG brand we offer chassis

### Our Functions

**_Research and Development_**

_Global R&D Program “6+2”_

We consider the challenges brought by the transformation in mobility and motion to be an
opportunity for actively helping to shape that transformation. With the aim of identifying
opportunities in our dynamic and complex market environment early on in order to ensure profitable
long-term growth with sustainable products, we defined our “Innovation-to-business” strategy. The
strategy consists of three phases. The first phase is the innovation strategy, which includes a global
R&D program, “6+2.” The 6+2 program defines six product innovation clusters, Energy Solutions,
Material Solutions, eDrive Solutions, Mobility Solutions, Robotics Solutions and Digital Solutions, and
two production innovations clusters Advanced Manufacturing and New Productions Concepts,
integrated into the Innovation & Technology cross-divisional subprogram of the Roadmap 2025. The
clusters promote a clear focus on the early identification and evaluation of innovative product ideas
and their market potential. The second phase involves organizing those product ideas into a global
project house. The third phase involves industrialization of those product ideas in accordance with
customer and market requirements.

Energy Solutions

Our Energy Solutions innovation cluster explores the potential of new technologies for a sustainable
energy supply and researches new technologies for generating, processing, and storing energy for
automotive and industrial applications. As an automotive and industrial supplier, we are considering
the full range of possible applications of hydrogen, including hydrogen production from electrolysis,
hydrogen fuel cells, and hydrogen-based steel production.

Our energy solutions focused R&D activities in 2022 included, among other things, entering into
research program, to accelerate the technological development of proton exchange membrane
(“PEM”) electrolyzers, by optimizing the most important components of the electrolyzer stack. For
hydrogen production technology, we developed new approaches for fuel cell stack components as
well as for increasing the efficiency of membrane electrode assemblies using new coatings. For
hydrogen storage technology, we demonstrated the ability of our fuel cell components to be used in
liquid organic hydrogen carriers and investigated potential for further improvement. For hydrogen
fuel cell technology, we developed our Enertect PC+ coating, which is a thin, carbon-based, and highperformance coating for metal bipolar plates in PEM fuel cells. Enertect PC+ allows PEMs to be
manufactured more efficiently, cost-effectively and sustainably. As a result of this innovation, we
were a finalist for the European Association of Automotive Supplier’s (CLEPA) Innovation Award in
the category “Clean and Sustainable Mobility.” In 2021 our activities included, among other things,
the enhancement of metallic bipolar plates, a key component for fuel cell stacks and we began
establishing a pilot plant for production of metallic bipolar pIates that started production of
prototypes in 2022. In addition, we are the project coordinator for the sub-project “Stack Scale up—
Industrializing PEM Electrolysis” of H2Giga, a hydrogen project involving over 130 companies and
research institutions that has received approximately €500 million of funding from Germany’s
Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The sub-project is comprised of nine partners from
industry and research and aims to promote the development of fuel cell stack technology to, among
other things, improve the efficiency of the technology, decrease production costs and further
develop the technology towards large-scale series production.


-----

Material Solutions

Our Material Solutions innovation cluster develops surfaces and coatings that represent key
technologies for numerous new and existing applications. As we seek to improve our CO2 footprint,
material solutions will play an essential role when it comes to sustainability. Significant contributions
to the improvement of our CO2 footprint can be made by careful conscientious selection of raw
materials such as alternative materials, composite materials, multi-material designs and coatings,
including, for example, green steel and alternate plastic. Coating technologies contribute to more
sustainable solutions by enabling the fulfillment of locally specific product requirements with minimal
use of materials. Additionally, modification of material characteristics through, for example heat
treatment, or improvement of materials through hardening can also improve our CO2 footprint. In
2021, we commissioned a plant in Nanjing, China to produce coatings to protect against a hydrogeninduced premature failure, which affects, for example, large-size wind power bearings.

eDrive Solutions

Our eDrive Solutions innovation cluster develops electric drive system and their core components,
electric motors, power electronics, and software as well as the related mechanic transmission and
bearing components for the next generation of electric drives and actuators. By bundling
competencies, we have expanded from a supplier of components and subsystems to a supplier of
complex system solutions for electric drives including software. For example, we developed a 4-in-1
electric axle, which combines the electric motor, transmission, power electronics with a thermal
management module that allows for direct cooling of the stator windings. We also developed a series
of new electric drives that combine high power density with improved overall system efficiency,
including through the use of friction-improved bearing systems. In 2021, we introduced an 800-volt
power electronic system for electric axle application in high-performance vehicles and also
developed a chainless electric drive system for the rapidly growing e-bike market and our focus for
further developing this focus on increasing the power density, reducing the carbon footprint and
increasing system efficiency.

Mobility Solutions

Our Mobility Solutions innovation cluster focuses on the effective implementation of electric drive
systems and automated driving as well as on developing fundamentally new mobility concepts. We
focus on new concepts such as autonomous people and logistics movers. Our steer-by-wire system
technology (“Space Drive”) is a key technology for autonomous driving. Space Drive is also a key part
of a more comprehensive drive-by-wire system that electronically controls not only the vehicle’s
steering system, but also its brakes and transmission. In 2022, in cooperation with REFIRE; a leading
global supplier of commercial hydrogen fuel cell technology, we developed the electric axel, fuel cell
stack, system controls and energy management system for an electric van concept powered by a 3in-1 electric axel in conjunction with a battery that is combined with a fuel cell system.

Robotics Solutions

Our Robotics Solutions innovation cluster develops highly integrated and intelligent system solutions
for the growing robotics market. With a portfolio of rolling bearings and system components such as
precision gearboxes and highly integrated torque sensor technology through to complete “smart”
systems for robotic joints, we are positioning ourselves as a partner for the dynamically growing
robotics industry. In 2022, we developed new products including bearings, gear units and a fully
integrated torque sensor system. These systems solutions can be used, for example, to enable
“cobots” (collaborative robots) to move faster, more precisely and more flexibly. We also expanded
our product portfolio to include ultra-precise planetary gears, which are also used in robots with
higher payloads of up to approximately 100 kilograms with the acquisition of Schaeffler Ultra
Precision Drives. In addition, we entered into a collaboration with the German Aerospace Center’s


-----

Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, to accelerate the development of application-oriented
solutions in robotics. In 2021, we developed a new generation of axial flux motors and new
transmissions with integrated torque sensors. The motors feature a printed circuit board that leads
to significantly higher power density than conventional direct current motors as well as increased
flexibility in design and production. The transmissions were also coated with Schaeffler Sensotect
PVD, which allows for real time measurement of stress in places where conventional sensors are not
an option, such as within robotics joints.

Digital Solutions

Our Digital Solutions innovation cluster combines our R&D activities aimed at developing digital
products with our product components. In 2022, our focus was on product related AI applications, for
instance for recording torques in robots and for sensor fusion in electric motors. In 2021, we joined
with 11 other partners to establish an incorporated society, KI Park e.V., in Berlin, Germany, to foster
real-life AI applications and to develop the associated ethical and regulatory frameworks for
Germany and Europe. We also worked with the Technical University of Berlin on an automated
electric vehicle based on steer-by-wire technology as part of the partnership with the Center for
Tangible Artificial Intelligence and Digitization e.V. (ZE-KI e.V.). In addition, in 2022, as part of the
Schaeffler Hub for Advanced Research program (“SHARE”), the autonomous mobile robot platform
DEX was designed for the Industrial Division in order to promote new production and service
concepts based on intelligent technologies with a high degree of digitization and automation.

Advanced Manufacturing

Our Advanced Manufacturing innovation cluster develops new processes for industrialization of a
product while the product is still in development. For example, the development of an additive
process for the production of hydrodynamic plain bearings for gearboxes in wind turbines, the
development of manufacturing processes that make more efficient use of materials and enhance
sustainability, as well as the development of improved soft machining processes for gear
components. Through collaboration with our external networks, universities and the startup
community, among others, we identify disruptive innovations and then evaluate their ability to meet
the requirements of our Divisions in order to focus on the further development of production
technologies in a targeted and needs-oriented manner.

New Production Concepts

Our New Production Concepts innovation cluster focuses on the development of modular and
flexible production concepts in order to be able to react efficiently to dynamic product requirements
and volume scenarios. Through a high level of standardization and modularity, we aim to ensure that
a wide range of process modules can be reused in a sustainable manner. In addition, we aim to make
production processes more autonomous using AI and digital twins to sustainably reduce production
costs, which includes the use of flexible and collaborative robots (“cobots”) for assembly and
handling tasks and on implementing driver-less transport systems. We also aim to develop solutions
with low-code or no-code approaches to ensure their quick and easy integration.

_Collaborative R&D_

Part of our R&D efforts is also our collaboration with a global innovation network of universities,
companies, research institutions, and start-ups under our open innovation strategy, which focuses in
particular on the development of future-oriented technologies, such as hydrogen, E-Mobility,
automated driving and digitalization. We have formed collaborations with universities in the form of
our initiative “Schaeffler Hub for Advanced Research” or “SHARE” under the unique “Company on
Campus” concept to help to ensure the consistent development of future-oriented technologies. For
example, in Germany, at the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology, Germany (SHARE at KIT), the


-----

collaboration concentrates on E-mobility and automated mobility and at the Friedrich-AlexanderUniversity Erlangen-Nuremberg, the research focus is on AI integrated into physical products and for
cloud-based solutions. In the Asia Pacific region, at the Nanyang Technological University in
Singapore, the research focus is on robotics and digitalization and at the Southwest Jiatong University
in Chengdu, China the research focus is on components and systems for high-speed trains. In the
America, at Ohio State University, the research focus is on solid state batteries.

In conjunction with our open innovation strategy, we have adopted a long-term corporate venturing
approach, where we act as a technology accelerator. In our innovation clusters, we review future
oriented technologies and innovative business models and work on pilot projects with startups and
small and medium sized businesses on the development of these future oriented technologies and
innovative business models. This approach enables successful long-term strategic cooperation and
the possibility of R&D partnerships, supplier relationships or future customer relationships. For
example, in 2021, we became a new anchor partner to STARTUP AUTOBAHN, which brings together
more than 30 partners and 30,000 start-ups with the objective of developing new technologies to
marketability.

_R&D Facilities_

As of December 31, 2022, we employed, on average, approximately 7,400 R&D staff in 20 R&D
centers and additional R&D locations in a total of 25 countries.

The R&D centers work in close cooperation with customers of the automotive industry, mechanical
engineering and aerospace in all key areas of product development. We use tools, such as simulation
and rapid prototyping, to develop increasingly complex products that involve mechatronics. From
individual bearing systems to complete vehicles and machine systems, all necessary tests can be
carried out at testing facilities. This increases the operating safety of our products and provides us
with valuable insights that allow us to further develop and improve our products. By using coatings
developed in-house, the operating life of engine components and bearings can be increased
considerably. In addition, by integrating sensor technology, drives and controls and software
programs that are developed in-house, our engineers are able to design and develop complete
powertrain systems.

We spent 5% of our consolidated revenue in R&D on average over 2020, 2021 and 2022 to
strengthen the foundation for promising innovations and our long-term competitive position further.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the
_Schaeffler Group—Key Factors affecting Results of Operations—Operating Expenses—Research and_
_Development (“R&D”) Expenses.”_

_Intellectual Property_

We have obtained many patents and licenses to cover our products, their design and our
manufacturing processes, and we are continuously seeking to secure further patents on our
developments.

In 2022, we registered 1,266 new patents, placing us fourth among Germany’s most innovative
companies according to the German Patent and Trademark Office (Deutsches Patent- und
_Markenamt, DPMA)._

We consider our intellectual property a competitive advantage of our business. Hence, we devote
significant resources to the filing and monitoring of our patents and other intellectual property rights,
to the prosecution of infringements thereof and to the protection of our proprietary information. For
example, we conduct intensive market studies regarding product counterfeits and, consequently,
enforce our claims by legal action. In addition, we monitor patent studies with regards to the
competitive situation of our developments.

For a description of the risks associated with intellectual property rights, see “Risk Factors—Legal,
_Regulatory and Tax Risks—We could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual_
_property and technical expertise” and “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—There is a risk_
_that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and could therefore be forced to_
_change our product offering or be exposed to additional costs.”_

**_Quality_**

Our product expertise and comprehensive quality management enable us to consistently ensure a
very high level of quality. We have received numerous awards from customers and maintain
internationally recognized certifications. As of December 31, 2022, nearly all of our plants are
certified under globally recognized quality standards such as IATF 16949:2016 (automotive industry
standard), ISO/TS 22163 (with specific requirements for the application of ISO 9001:2015 for the rail
sector), SEA AS 9100D:2016-09-20 (requirements for aerospace and defense organizations), and ISO
9001:2015 (industrial sector standard).

We use a variety of methods to ensure and improve the quality of our products and processes. We
have continued to develop and reinforce the interaction of error prevention and error detection
activities and have implemented a systematic approach to achieving the highest quality with the
objective of “zero defects.” “Zero defects” stands for process stabilization and continuous
improvement and facilitates the early detection and elimination of weaknesses. The program defines
policies and rules of conduct for the day-to-day work of all employees. It provides guidance and
orientation on how to prevent errors to begin with or how to permanently eliminate them. In
addition, in 2022, we launched our comprehensive quality program “SHAPE,” to address the quality
aspects of the transformation in mobility and motion. SHAPE focuses on four elements: (i) technical
expertise and reputation, (ii) agile processes and methods, (iii) quality principles and mindset, and (iv)
sustainable quality and performance.

Our comprehensive quality management system is based on a central management handbook
containing regulations and prescribed processes applicable group-wide and comprehensive quality
training schemes that have been implemented worldwide. Compliance with and monitoring of these
requirements are subject to regular audits and reviews, which are designed to ensure a uniform
global level of quality. In addition, each business unit has managers specifically responsible for quality
or other quality experts working closely with the relevant management in order to ensure that the
quality management system in the manufacturing facilities and locations is continuously improved.

**_Production Technologies_**

We are among the leaders in the fields of cold forming technology, forging, machining, heat
treatment, plating technology and assembly. Deep drawing, a process in the field of cold forming, is
one of our core technologies. Our expertise in metal forming of precision products enables us to
manufacture solutions tailored to our customers in high-volume production at an outstanding costperformance ratio. All work related to quality, such as grinding (e.g., precision grinding) and honing
the inner and outer rings of rolling bearings, is carried out in-house.

Assembly is carried out primarily on linked and automated manufacturing lines, ensuring high
standards of quality for our products. Our in-house special machine and tool manufacturing
department develops processing solutions that are specially adapted to the needs of the production
process of individual products, enabling us to manufacture our products flexibly and cost-effectively.

We are taking a comprehensive approach to digitalizing our production technologies to increase their
efficiency. We are refining our production processes to be sensor driven, interconnected and data
based, to utilize artificial intelligence, as applicable, and to reduce and simplify manual interfaces by
providing individual and tailored information to our employees for a special production step.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

As of December 31, 2022, we operated 76 plants in 22 countries worldwide, the vast majority of
which are owned by us; 52 plants are producing for the Automotive Technologies Division and 23
plants are producing for the Industrial Division. Large plants that produce for both divisions are
aggregated in “campus locations,” which we established effective January 1, 2020. A key feature of
these campus locations is the existence of several plants at one location with shared use of support
functions such as human resources, logistics, or location planning functions. The Automotive
Aftermarket Division is largely supplied by the Automotive Technologies Division’s production and
manufacturing locations.

In September 2020, the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s assembly and packaging center in Halle,
Germany (the “AKO”) commenced operations (in addition to the existing centers in Mexico City,
Singapore and Shanghai). The AKO is operated by a third-party operator. As a result of delivery delays
and quality issues at the AKO, which resulted in customer claims and a loss of some business for the
Automotive Aftermarket Division, we terminated the former third-party operator’s contract effective
as of February 1, 2022 and a new third-party operator took over operation of the AKO on August 1,
2022. While we were able to reach a settlement for damages with the former third-party operator,
we were not able to recover the full amount of our losses. See also “—Risk Factors—Our future
_business success depends on our ability to maintain the high quality of our products and the punctual_
_delivery of ordered goods.”_

In 2021, we opened our new E-mobility plant in Szombathely, Hungary. The plant was designed with
high sustainability standards and is a center for excellence for components and systems for
electrified powertrains. It is also our first production plant worldwide dedicated to electric mobility
and created 150 jobs in this area. We also expanded the Industrial Division’s pant in Nanjing, China,
and it is now the largest production location for wind power bearings within the Schaeffler Group.
We also opened a large size bearing refurbishment center in India.

In 2022, we established a technology and innovation center in Erlangen-Frauenaurach designed to
increase flexibility in developing new production technologies to the point of series production. We
also began the expansion of our e-mobility development and manufacturing campus in Buehl,
Germany, to add a new building complex that will serve as a new center of excellence for E-mobility.
At our Bussmatten site, we are converting a production hall previously used to manufacture
transmission components into a production plant for electric motors that will be known as the
UltraELab. This global flagship plant is being built in accordance with the principles of the “ultraefficient factory” concept developed by the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in partnership with
Schaeffler and others. This innovative manufacturing concept is being developed under the
AgiloDrive2 project led by Schaeffler alongside 17 other consortium partners with funding support
from Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). In India, we
inaugurated our new center of competence in software and electronics development in Pune as well
as a consolidation and distribution center in Hosur, India. In America, we are building an additional
production plant for hybrid modules. In addition, on December 29, 2022, we acquired 100% of the
shares of SPV Solarpark, which operates a solar energy farm in Kammerstein, Germany, with a total
area of just over 26 acres and an installed peak capacity of almost 10 MW, which is enough to supply
about 2% of our electricity requirements in Germany. In addition, as part of the Ewellix Acquisition in
January 2023, we acquired six additional manufacturing and customization sites in Europe, the U.S.
and Asia (please note that the Ewellix Group sites and employees are not consolidated with the
Schaeffler Group plants and employees for purposes of the discussions of the latter in this Offering
Memorandum).

In recognition of changing technological, regulatory and customer requirements, we continuously
evaluate and adjust our production footprint to streamline structures and align them more closely
with the requirements of our Divisions. In 2020, we sold our shares in Schaeffler Bio-Hybrid GmbH. In


-----

July 2022, we sold the global chain drive business of the Automotive Technologies Division and we
also sold our Clausthal-Zellerfeld site. In addition, we intend to sell our sites in Russia.

In September 2020, as part of our restructuring measures, we announced that we will gradually close
our production plants in Eltmann, Wuppertal, and Luckenwalde, Germany, and relocate their
activities. Operations at the Wuppertal, Germany plant were discontinued in 2022. In November
2022, we initiated further restructuring measures, which will include reducing our headcount by
1,300 positions worldwide. Within Germany, mainly the Herzogenaurach, Buehl and Homburg
locations will be affected. In Herzogenaurach and Buehl, we plan to adapt our internal structures to
new market conditions and future technologies, such as E-mobility and hydrogen. In Homburg, we
plan to increase automation and develop more efficient internal structures. In addition, Ingolstadt
and Morbach will be affected and strategies for these locations, which produce components solely
for combustion engine vehicles, are currently being developed in consultation with employee
representatives for those locations.

In addition to consolidating locations, we are also strengthening local capabilities in individual
locations, particularly in Germany, by clustering and consolidating local technology and production
capabilities in Herzogenaurach, Hoechstadt, Buehl and Schweinfurt. In Herzogenaurach, we are
focusing on establishing a cross-divisional central laboratory facility, which is expected to be
completed in 2023, as well as a cross-divisional center of excellence for the production of hydrogen
technology, a technology which we believe offers extensive opportunities for both the Industrial and
the Automotive Technology Divisions. In Hoechstadt, we opened an innovative tool technology
center in May 2022 and, in Buehl, where the Automotive Technologies Division is headquartered, we
are expanding our location into a center for excellence for E-mobility and electric-motor mass
production. We are also focusing on strengthening the contribution of our Schweinfurt location, the
headquarters of the Industrial Division, to industrial automation, robotics, as well as our traditional
bearing business by consolidating and clustering its production processes for classic mid- and largediameter bearings products. We also moved the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s headquarters
from Langen to Frankfurt in July 2022, to strengthen the headquarters and offer room for agile,
flexible and digital collaboration. We will also transfer the Gunzenhausen plant from the Automotive
Technologies Division to the Automotive Aftermarket Division, which will become the Automotive
Aftermarkets Division’s first plant.

Our headquarters are located in Herzogenaurach, Germany. We own the area and the building.

The following table provides an overview of our most important plants in order of size of property:

**_Purchasing of Raw Materials and Energy Resources_**

Steel is the principal raw material used in many of our products. We also use other alloys, aluminum,
zinc, copper and other non-ferrous metals as well as plastics and lubricants. We purchase raw
materials from global suppliers with whom we work closely to assure steel quality. Other important
production materials include castings, turned parts and forgings. We obtain raw materials from a
variety of sources and in general from more than one supplier. Our top five and top 100 suppliers
accounted for approximately 8% and approximately 49%, respectively, of total purchases in 2022.

Prices of raw materials and energy resources are subject to change or curtailment due to, among
other things, new laws or regulations, changes in demand levels, suppliers’ allocations to other
purchasers, interruptions in production by supplier or in transport, changes in exchange rates and
prevailing price levels. Since mid-2021 and in particular since the beginning of the war in Ukraine in
February 2022, we have experienced significant increases in the prices of many of our raw materials
and energy.

In 2022, we entered into short-, medium-, and long-term price and supply agreements to mitigate
the risk of rising energy prices, because this risk increased in 2022 as compared to prior years. As in
prior years, we generally enter into long-term purchasing contracts relating to raw materials and
preliminary products. Prices for long products, such as bars, wires, tubes and rings produced thereof
are generally fixed with an annual base price, monthly scrap and alloy surcharges. Prices for flat
products, such as hot-rolled and cold-rolled strip, are generally fixed for shorter periods.

For a description of the risk associated with raw materials and energy supply, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks related to our Business Operations and the Markets in which we operate—We depend on a_
_limited number of key suppliers for certain products_ _and inability to source products from these_
_suppliers, particularly due to supply interruptions, could adversely affect our operations” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks related to our Business Operations and the Markets in which we operate—Prices of_
_many of our raw materials and energy have increased significantly and may rise further, which may_
_lead to higher production and manufacturing costs.”_

Since 2009, we have cooperated with Continental AG with respect to purchasing. In 2022, we entered
into a purchasing cooperation agreement with Vitesco Technologies GmbH, a subsidiary of Vitesco
AG and into a triparty purchasing cooperation agreement with Continental AG and Vitesco
Technologies GmbH, a subsidiary of Vitesco AG. In 2023, we entered into a triparty procurement
agreement for non-production material with Continental AG and Vitesco Technologies GmbH, a
subsidiary of Vitesco AG. The goal of these cooperations is to strengthen the market and negotiation
position of the respective parties under the relevant agreement by cumulating their respective
purchasing volumes, allowing them to jointly negotiate lower prices and to achieve advantageous
conditions, including procuring higher quality and higher performance from suppliers. However, the
actual purchase of the mutually sourced products is conducted independently by each party and for
the respective party’s own account. The individual purchasing cooperations agreements with
Continental AG and Vitesco Technologies GmbH remain applicable for purchases outside the scope of
the triparty purchasing agreements. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
_Transactions of the Schaeffler Group—Cooperation Agreements.”_

**_Information Technology Systems_**

The Schaeffler Group’s information technology infrastructure is characterized by a high level of
standardization. Our information technology systems and application landscapes rely heavily on SAP
software. Our applications are unified for our Divisions.


-----

### Our Regions 

Our business activities are divided into four regions: Europe (Germany, Western Europe, Middle East
& Africa, Central & Eastern Europe), the Americas (the United States & Canada, South America,
Mexico), Greater China (including Mainland China, and also Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao) and
Asia/Pacific (South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia and India). In 2022, we generated 41.5% of our
consolidated revenue in Europe, 22.3% in the Americas, 22.8% in Greater China and 13.4% in
Asia/Pacific. We have built a global manufacturing footprint with each of our plants having a strong
regional foothold. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 44 plants in Europe, 13 in the Americas,
ten in Greater China and nine in Asia/Pacific. In addition, as part of the Ewellix Acquisition in January
2023, we acquired six additional manufacturing and customization sites in Europe, the U.S. and Asia
and 1,196 employees (please note that the Ewellix Group sites and employees are not consolidated
with the Schaeffler Group plants and employees for purposes of the discussions of the latter in this
Offering Memorandum).

**_Employees_**

The following table shows the headcount as of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, in our functional
areas:

**Number of Employees** **As of December 31,**

**2020** **2021** **2022**

**(unaudited)**

General Administration ............................................................................. 4,565 4,559 4,739

**Total ..........................................................................................................** **83,297** **82,981** **82,773**

Our headcount decreased by 5.7% to 82,773 from 2019 to December 31, 2022. In 2019, we
established a voluntary redundancy program for Germany, with the aim of reducing our headcount in
Germany by 1,300 positions in a socially responsible manner. The program was closed, as agreed
with the employee representatives on March 31, 2020. In addition, we sold our plants in Unna,
Germany and Kaltennordheim, Germany, effective February 3, 2020, and the employment contracts
of the employees in those plants were transferred to the acquirors of the assets by a transfer of
undertakings (Betriebsübergang). In September 2020, we announced structural measures, which
included a net headcount reduction of 4,400 positions in Europe. In September 2020, as part of our
restructuring measures, we announced that we will gradually close our production plants in Eltmann,
Wuppertal, and Luckenwalde, Germany, and relocate their activities. Operations at the Wuppertal,
Germany plant were discontinued in 2022. In 2022, we initiated further restructuring measures, with
the aim of reducing our headcount by 1,300 positions worldwide Within Germany, mainly the
Herzogenaurach, Buehl and Homburg locations will be affected, as well as the Ingolstadt and
Morbach locations. In Herzogenaurach and Buehl, we plan to adapt our internal structures to new
market conditions and future technologies, such as E-mobility and hydrogen. In Homburg, we plan to
increase automation and develop more efficient internal structures. In addition, Ingolstadt and
Morbach will be affected and strategies for these locations, which produce components solely for
combustion engine vehicles, are currently being developed in consultation with employee
representatives for those locations. Nearly all of our plants are certified under globally recognized
quality norms, standards, and regulations. In addition, as part of the Ewellix Acquisition in January
2023, we acquired six additional manufacturing and customization sites in Europe, the U.S. and Asia
(please note that the Ewellix Group sites are not consolidated with the Schaeffler Group plants for
purposes of the discussions of the latter in this Offering Memorandum).


-----

The following table shows the headcount as of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 for each of the
regions in which we operate:

**Region** **As of December 31,**

**2020** **2021** **2022**

**(unaudited)**

Europe ....................................................................................................... 53,865 53,006 51,871

Americas ................................................................................................... 11,785 11,599 11,657

Greater China ............................................................................................ 11,787 12,337 12,874

**Total ..........................................................................................................** **83,297** **82,981** **82,773**

As part of the Ewellix Acquisition in January 2023, we acquired 1,196 additional employees (please
note that the Ewellix Group employees are not consolidated with the Schaeffler Group employees for
purposes of the discussions of the latter in this Offering Memorandum). The number of employees of
the Schaeffler Group as of the date of this Offering Memorandum does not differ significantly from
the number of employees as of December 31, 2022.

**_Relationships with Unions and Works Councils_**

A significant number of our employees in Germany are represented by unions, along with many of
the employees in other countries. Furthermore, our employees in Germany are represented by
employee representative bodies such as works councils (Betriebsräte).

In Germany, we are a member of several regional employers’ associations (Arbeitgeberverbände)
(pertaining to the metal and electrical industry). We are therefore subject to various collective
bargaining agreements of these associations. Furthermore, we are subject to collective bargaining
agreements in various other countries (e.g., China, South Korea and Slovakia).

In accordance with German law, our German employees established a group works council
(Konzernbetriebsrat) at the level of Schaeffler AG for all employees of our German Schaeffler Group
companies, some central works councils (Gesamtbetriebsräte) at the level of individual Schaeffler
Group companies, for example, there is a central works council for Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co.
KG, and separate local works councils (Betriebsräte) for each German plant. Further, the employees
of Schaeffler Group companies in Europe are represented by a European works council (Europäischer
_Betriebsrat) at the level of Schaeffler AG._

Schaeffler AG entered into a framework social plan (Rahmensozialplan) in 2018 with its central works
council which could apply to future personnel measures for operational reasons at certain German
entities of the Schaeffler Group in Germany. The applicability of the framework social plan at other
German entities of the Schaeffler Group, depends on negotiations with the competent local works
council for the individual German entity of the Schaeffler Group concerned. Employees affected by
such measures would be entitled to certain benefits (e.g., severance payments, wage protection in
the event of relocations or qualification measures). The framework social plan may be terminated
with three months’ notice before the end of each half-year without any consequences.

We have a close and constructive relationship with the representative bodies of our employees and
the competent unions.

On April 16, 2018, the Board of Managing Directors, the Schaeffler Group works council, Schaeffler
Technologies AG & Co. KG central works council and the IG Metall trade union signed a future accord
(the “Future Accord”) with the intention of managing and driving the on-going development and
transformation of the Schaeffler Group and its response to key future trends, with particular regard
to E-Mobility and digitalization, jointly and collaboratively, in the best interests of the Schaeffler
Group and the employees. Under the Future Accord, a joint steering committee was established and
consists of equal numbers of representatives from the parties to the Future Accord and functions as a


-----

coordinating and information sharing body with a view towards reaching agreement on relevant key
issues. A core objective of the Future Accord is employee up-skilling and on-going training and
professional development, for example, the Schaeffler Academy offers target group-oriented
programs for new and additional qualifications for our employees globally, across all work areas and
hierarchy levels, as well as strengthening the commercial viability of our European locations.

In principle, the Future Accord prohibits layoffs. When facing organizational changes, the steering
committee may only consider layoffs after it determines that all measures to avoid layoffs have been
exhausted. The Future Accord also provides that we work with IG Metall to ensure that all employees
that are not currently covered by the collective bargaining agreement with IG Metall enjoy working
conditions comparable to those who are covered. Under the Future Accord, we have also agreed to
make a €50 million investment fund available over a 5 year period. The purpose of the fund is to
foster innovation and actively harness the innovative capacity of our employees, achieve sustainable
value creation, strengthen our locations in Germany and safeguard jobs over the long term. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to our Business Operations and the Markets in which we operate—Our_
_business could be adversely impacted by strikes and other labor disputes.”_

**_Pensions_**

The Schaeffler Group has defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for its employees.

We provide defined benefit pension plans in Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and
certain other countries. As of December 31, 2022, our total pension obligations (defined benefit
obligation) amounted to €2,287 million. As of December 31, 2022, our net pension obligations for
defined benefit pension plans (defined benefit obligation less pension plan assets, funded status)
amounted to €1,515 million.

Most of our defined benefit pension plans in Germany are not externally funded due to the
applicable insolvency law protection system under German law (section 7 et seq. of the German
Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz)). Our externally invested pension plan assets are
funded through externally managed investment funds. While we prescribe the general investment
strategies applied by these funds, we do not determine their individual investment alternatives. The
pension plan assets are invested in different asset classes including equity, fixed-income securities
and real estate.

For further information on our pension obligations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Schaeffler Group—Contractual and Other_
_Obligations—Pension Obligations.”_

### Environment, Social and Governance 

**_Sustainability Strategy and Management_**

Sustainability is a matter of overarching importance that influences and sets the tone across our
business. We have an established focus on sustainability that meets customer, social and
environmental needs while also serving the needs of our stakeholders and society. As part of our
Roadmap 2025 strategy, in addition to our Sustainability Strategy, we formulated a “Sustainability &
Engagement” subprogram that embeds environmental and social responsibility in our value chain as
a central success factor for a sustainable business operation. The United Nations’ 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (“SDGs”) form the foundation of our sustainability guidelines and we contribute
to thirteen SDGs (good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, clean water and
sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and
infrastructure, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption
and production, climate action, peace, justice and strong institutions and partnerships for the goals).
We are also a signatory and supporter of the United Nations’ Global Compact and committed to its


-----

ten principles, the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement, and the EU Sustainable Finance Action
Plan. In addition, we are a member of the German Action Plan on Business and Human Rights and the
Value Balancing Alliance through which we work with other companies to develop a consistent
standard for measurement and monetary assessment of the environmental and social impact of
companies. We are part of “econsense,” an association of global companies and organizations active
in the German economy with the goal of promoting sustainable economic development. We are also
committed to diversity within the Schaeffler Group and are a signatory to the “Charta der Vielfalt”
and are committed to its standards for a corporate culture based on integration and mutual respect.

In 2021, the United Nations selected the Schaeffler Group as one of its “50 Sustainability & Climate
Leaders” and we represent the automotive and industrial supplier section in the DACH region
(Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). In 2021, on the occasion of our 75th anniversary, the Issuer and
the Schaeffler Group established the Schaeffler Foundation to emphasize the commitment of the
Schaeffler Group and the Schaeffler Family to social responsibility. The Schaeffler Foundation
operates worldwide and focuses on climate and environmental protection, research and science, and
education, qualification and equal opportunity. In 2022, the global non-profit CDP, which is a leading
environmental disclosure database and sets the standard for corporate environmental disclosure
transparency, awarded us the highest rating of “A” in the categories of climate change and water
security, recognizing our leadership in disclosure and performance in those categories.

In 2022, we transferred the overall responsibility for sustainability to our Chief Executive Officer. We
also adopted a more decentralized decision-making approach for sustainability issues and established
a dedicated sustainability network across all Divisions, functions and regions. As an integral part of
our Sustainability Strategy, we organize our sustainability efforts into ten action fields related to each
of the ESG dimensions. The action fields related to environment include, (1) climate neutrality, (2)
circularity, (3) resource efficiency and environmental protection, and (4) green products. The action
fields related to social include, (5) diversity, employees and people development, (6) occupational
health and safety, (7) responsibility in society and the supply chain, and (8) product safety and
integrity. The action fields related to governance include, (9) corporate governance and (10) business
integrity.

Our long-term sustainability goals are designed to help us achieve our aim of becoming a climateneutral company by 2040, including goals for reducing the emissions generated by us and in our
supply chain and for purchasing electricity from renewable sources. The Science Based Targets
Initiative (“SBTi”), which creates criteria and recommendations for companies to define emission
reduction goals to fulfill the goals of the Paris Agreement. SBTi approved our Scope 1+2 2030
Performance Goal and Scope 3 2030 Performance Goal and considered these goals compliant with
the criteria and recommendations of the SBTi and thus the latest climate science for fulfilling the
Paris Agreement.


-----

In addition, we have defined eight sustainability goals based on the ten action fields, which we
formulated in compliance with the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The table
below sets out our sustainability goals.

- Efforts to achieve these targets focus on reduction measures; unavoidable emissions are offset with compensation measures.

In 2020, we developed the Schaeffler Group Green Finance Framework to outline the parameters
under which we may issue green financing instruments and use the proceeds to finance and
refinance eligible green projects that contribute to a low-carbon and more climate friendly economy.
In 2020, we placed €300 million in promissory notes (Schuldschein) pursuant to the Schaeffler Group
Green Finance Framework (of which €41 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2022) to
refinance sustainable projects from 2017 to 2019, particularly in the categories of zero-emissions
mobility and generation of climate-friendly wind power. In addition, in 2022, we incorporated ESG
targets into the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement.

We have adopted a worldwide risk management and compliance management system that is aimed
at preventing corruption, fraud, money laundering, financing of terrorism and other criminal or
unauthorized behavior by our employees, consultants, agents and suppliers. Our Governance, Risk &
Compliance Committee (“GRCC”), co-chaired by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, represents an important component of our governance structure. The GRCC is made up each
of the heads of the relevant governance functions, including compliance, risk management, internal
control systems, and internal audit. The GRCC oversees the elements of our governance structure,
which include transparent risk reporting, compliance management to prevent corruption, money
laundering, and economic crime, due diligence and reporting systems to systematically ensure lawful
behavior; compliance training, data protection, information security and cybersecurity, human rights
due diligence, responsible tax strategy, and business continuity and crisis management. We
periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over
financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications

_and Tax Risks—Our compliance management system may fail to prevent or detect corruption, fraud,_
_money laundering, other criminal or unauthorized behavior or violations of trade and economic_
_sanctions rules.”_

**_Strategy_**

In 2022, we developed our Climate Action Plan under the action field climate neutrality, which serves
as a framework for the design and implementation of our sustainability goals and consists of six
elements: (1) strategy, (2) green purchasing, (3) green production, (4) green products, (5) finance/IT,
and (6) people. The Climate Action Plan includes concrete goals and measures designed to achieve
emissions reductions that go beyond the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement and to help us
achieve our aim of becoming a climate-neutral company by 2040. A key task of this strategy is to
increase support for Schaeffler Group management for the further development and monitoring of
non-financial key performance indicators. In addition, the core of the strategy includes anchoring
sustainability criteria into key business processes, such as the product development, purchasing and
investment processes, as well as Schaeffler Group-wide modeling of GHG Emissions projections, the
derivation of the financial implications of the emissions reduction path and the definition and
tracking of internal ESG goals.

**_Green Purchasing_**

Supplier management requirements have expanded beyond a globally connected world. Modern
technologies require raw materials that often come from unstable regions in the world. In addition,
climate change is impacting global supply chains. We view sustainable procurement, which
encompasses the responsible use of critical materials, human rights, and environmental and social
standards, as key to integrity-based governance. Our Supplier Code of Conduct contains minimum
requirements for direct suppliers that go beyond national laws and internationally recognized
guidelines. These minimum requirements are based on the principles of the United Nations Global
Compact and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization and was revised in
2021 to better accommodate new customer requirements and the EU Commission’s proposed
Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence. We are working towards preventing human
rights violations in the form of child and forced labor as well as discrimination based on racial/ethnic
origin, color, or gender for all our business contacts.

Green purchasing includes all of the climate-relevant measures of sustainable procurement, including
dialogues with strategically relevant steel suppliers about their climate performance and sustainable
logistics and packaging. To this end, we have identified significant levers in steel, aluminum, plastics,
electronic components, and logistics, among others, which make a significant contribution to
decarbonization based on the product portfolio. On this basis, we are continuing to develop our
purchasing strategy and seek active dialog with potential suppliers, among others for the purchasing
of green bearing steel. The measures include, the Green Steel Activation program, which addresses
several influencing factors in steel production and refinement in a technology-neutral manner. For
example, in 2021, we entered into an agreement with H2 Green Steel, a Swedish start-up company,
to purchase green steel starting in 2025, and in 2022, we made an investment in H2 Green Steel. We
may also consider participating in future financing rounds of H2 Green Steel. Green steel is largely
produced by using green hydrogen, which is a low carbon production process. In 2022, we also
entered into a contract with REEtec AS, a Norwegian company, to purchase rare earth metals for
magnets used in electric motors, which are produced using a sustainable production process.

**_Green Production_**

Green production focuses on making our production processes climate-neutral, which includes the
procurement of green raw materials and input products as well as the use of renewable energy. Since


-----

2020, as part of our energy efficiency program, we have implemented more than 200 measures
leading to cumulative annual savings of approximately 47 GWh starting in 2022. Going forward, from
2022 to 2024, we aim to identify and implement energy efficiency measures in our production
processes that will lead to annual energy savings of 100 GWh from 2025. In addition, our goals are by
2025, for 10% of Schaeffler’s electricity requirements worldwide, and by 2030, for 25% of Schaeffler’s
electricity requirements worldwide to be supplied by self-generated renewable energy. For example,
since 2022, our plants in the Europe and Greater China regions have been sourcing 100% of their
electricity from renewable sources and we plan for our plants in the Americas region to follow in
2023 and our plants in the Asia/Pacific region to follow in 2024. In addition, in 2022, we entered into
supply contracts with Statkraft Markets GmbH, to purchase approximately 11% and 8% of our
electricity requirements in Germany from solar energy sources starting in 2023 and wind power
starting in 2024, respectively. As we believe the demand for electricity will continue to increase going
forward, we are also increasing our in-house generation of renewable energy. Our sites in Kitzingen,
Germany, Pune and Savli, India, and Szombathely, Hungary, have solar energy systems with total
output of 2.3 megawatts peak (“MWp”). On December 29, 2022, we acquired 100% of the shares of
SPV Solarpark, which operates a solar energy farm in Kammerstein, Germany, with a total area of just
over 26 acres and an installed peak capacity of almost 10 MW, which is enough to supply about 2% of
our electricity requirements in Germany. We also intend to install an additional 22 solar energy
systems with total output of 26.1 MWp. In addition, we are measuring and developing systems to use
the waste heat generated by our production processes as a source of renewable energy. In addition,
we aim to ensure that any new plants built in the future are climate-friendly and that corresponding
specifications are integrated into our procurement and investment guidelines. We also signed a letter
of intent in 2022 with Lhyfe, a French green hydrogen producer, for Lhyfe to construct and operate
an industrial electrolysis plant on our site in Herzogenaurach, Germany, with a capacity of up to 15
MW. We expect the plant to start operations in 2025 and to supply our Herzogenaurach plant and
other regional customers with approximately 3.7 tons of green hydrogen daily. The agreement with
Lhyfe also sets out a technology partnership to promote the use of our electrolysis stacks.

**_Green Products_**

The fight against climate change requires forward-looking technologies that promote the switch to
renewable energies and provide solutions for generating, transporting, storing and efficiently using
renewable energies. We take a holistic approach to developing innovative product solutions for the
demands of the future, from climate-friendly energy generation and alternate powertrains to
intelligent repair solutions and new mobility concepts. For example, the Automotive Technologies
Division develops alternative drive technologies that help reduce the average CO₂ emissions of
vehicles, the Automotive Aftermarket Division’s solutions extend the life cycle of vehicles in
accordance with the latest environmental standards, and the Industrial Division’s low-friction
bearings increase energy efficiency in wind turbines. With our products and solutions, we help our
customers to achieve their climate goals.

Green products focuses on decarbonizing our product portfolio. We are developing a holistic concept
for automated life cycle assessments aimed at revealing a product’s environmental impact
throughout its entire life cycle and to be used to develop measures for the improvement of carbon
footprints at the individual product level. This is expected to help us to identify CO2 savings potential
as well as to evaluate the economic and technical feasibility of enhancements to our production
processes aimed at reducing our carbon footprint.

**_Finance & IT_**

Finance and IT includes the technical development of our internal and external sustainability
reporting capabilities, the development of consistent models for sustainability data and the
appropriate IT infrastructure as well as the design of appropriate sustainability models for


-----

management. In particular, this encompasses the continued development and implementation of
systems to collect emissions and other relevant data.

**_People_**

Our employees are one of the most important pillars of our success. Their expertise, skills,
dedication, and ingenuity ensure our continuous development and our essential to our ability to
reach our sustainability goals. For that reason, we intend to carry out training and awareness
campaigns in order to encourage all our employees to not only participate in our ongoing
sustainability initiatives, but to contribute their own ideas. For example, in 2022, as part of our
Climate Action Day, our employees contributed approximately 23,000 ideas designed to help reduce
carbon emissions.

We also support the professional development of our workforce, from apprentices to specialists and
managers. We promote occupational health and safety as well as diversity. We offer fair,
performance-oriented payment and retirement plans and help our workforce achieve work-life
balance by offering flexible working time models. We are also committed to societal well-being in the
local communities surrounding our numerous sites. We do not pursue any inappropriate tax planning
strategies and we pay taxes wherever we generate value. We also donate to organizations and
initiatives that work towards the common good, are non-profit, and operate in compliance with our
Code of Conduct.

### Environmental Regulation, Compliance, Insurance and Legal 

_Environment and Pollution_

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations in various
jurisdictions, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials, the
clean-up of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety. See “Regulatory Framework.” We
have implemented a global environmental management system, based on the energy and
environmental standards, which has been certified according to ISO 14001 and the EU EcoManagement and Audit Scheme for environmental management and the ISO 50001 for energy
management, among others, and an occupational health and safety management system, which has
been certified according to ISO 45001, at many of our sites.

Our operations include the use and storage of hazardous materials and can otherwise have an impact
on soil and groundwater. Other environmentally sensitive substances required for the operation of
sites, such as fuel and heating and lubricating oil, are used and stored at our sites. In addition, many
of the sites at which we operate have been used for various industrial purposes for many years. As a
result, some of our sites could be affected by soil and groundwater contamination. In some cases, we
are obligated to perform further investigations or clean-up operations.

In 2021, soil investigations carried out on the outside area at our location in Eltmann, Germany,
revealed mineral oil residues in the ground. The responsible authorities were informed. During an
expanded investigation to deeper layers of soil and the interior of the facility, which was completed
in 2022, no further areas of contamination were identified. As a next step, appropriate remediation
measures are to be identified, which will also depend on the future use of the property. We have
made a related provision in the amount of €25 million, which may prove insufficient depending on
the further use of the location.

At some of our sites, asbestos was used in the construction of buildings. At present, asbestos used at
these sites is usually encapsulated in other materials, such as asbestos-containing cement boards
used for heat insulation. The replacement of encapsulated asbestos is usually not required under
environmental laws. If a building is refurbished or demolished, however, or if asbestos-containing
materials are in a condition that could cause asbestos to become airborne, precautions for the


-----

protection of employees must be taken, and the material must be properly disposed of. At some of
our sites, asbestos-containing structures may have to be demolished and such materials disposed of
in the future.

For a detailed description of the risks associated with the use of hazardous material and possible soil,
water and groundwater contamination, see “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We
_could be held liable for soil, water or groundwater contamination or for risks related to hazardous_
_materials.”_

_Compliance_

All countries in which we operate have adopted complex laws, regulations, technical rules and
standards, in particular in regards to environmental protection. We are required to obtain and
maintain permits from governmental authorities for many of our operations. These laws, regulations
and permits are subject to change over time and require the ongoing improvement and retrofitting
of plants, equipment and operations, which can, at times, require substantial investments. Also see
“Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—Our compliance management system may fail to
_prevent or detect corruption, fraud, money laundering, other criminal or unauthorized behavior or_
_violations of trade and economic sanctions rules.”_

**_Insurance Coverage_**

We believe that we have economically reasonable and on standard market terms insurance coverage
with respect to product and environmental liability, property insurance, business interruption
insurance and other insurance (for example, automobile, credit and freight insurance). Furthermore,
we consider the insurance coverage level relating to our directors and officers (“D&O” insurance) to
be economically reasonable and on standard market terms.

**_Litigation and Administrative Proceedings_**

_Antitrust Investigations_

Since 2011, various antitrust authorities, including authorities in the EU and the U.S., have been
investigating several manufacturers of bearings and other products, particularly for the automotive
and other industrial sectors, including us, with respect to possible agreements and concerted
practices violating antitrust laws. We have paid substantial fines in connection with these
proceedings in the past. Although most of these investigations were closed, an investigation in Brazil
remains open.

The Brazilian antitrust authority, CADE, has initiated an investigation against our Brazilian subsidiary,
Schaeffler Brasil Ltda., regarding an alleged exchange of information in violation of Brazilian antitrust
laws. We intend to defend ourselves in any proceedings resulting from that preliminary investigation.
An investigation report by CADE was expected to be issued within 2020, however, due to the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, it is not possible to predict when the report will be issued.

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice served a grand jury subpoena on Schaeffler Group USA Inc. In
2012, Schaeffler Group USA Inc. submitted documents and information to the U.S. Department of
Justice. As Schaeffler Group USA Inc. has not received a response since, we believe that it is unlikely
that proceedings will be reactivated against our subsidiary.

If any competent antitrust authority concludes that we participated in anti-competitive practices, it
may seek to impose a fine. Furthermore, prosecutors may initiate criminal proceedings against us or
our employees where applicable. In addition, we have been, are and may in the future be exposed to
substantial follow-on civil damage claims from both direct and indirect purchasers of affected
products. As a result of the decision by the European Commission related to the bearings cartel in


-----

2014, several customers approached us regarding damage claims or brought claims against us. These
claims have been settled in the meantime, and any new claims would be time barred.

Since May 2012, several class action lawsuits have been filed by plaintiffs in the United States and
Canada against various Schaeffler Group companies and certain other defendants in the context of
the U.S. Department of Justice investigation. The plaintiffs sought damages in an unspecified amount,
attorneys’ fees and an injunction against the defendants. We have since settled all of these class
action lawsuits filed in the United States and Canada. Currently, none of the individual plaintiffs who
opted out of those settlements are pursuing claims for damages against our subsidiaries or have
threatened to file such claims, to our knowledge. However, there can be no assurance that they will
not bring claims against us in the future.

On February 5, 2021, a motion to certify a class action was filed by three individuals with the Central
District Court in Tel Aviv, Israel, seeking unspecified damages allegedly suffered by Israeli consumers
as a result of the impact of the alleged cartel maintained by the defendants on the prices of vehicles,
including the defendants’ components and parts. Among the defendants are Schaeffler AG and
several of its subsidiaries. The motion refers to antitrust proceedings in the United States, Europe,
and Japan and alleges that the defendants were members of a cartel regarding bearings from April 8,
2004 to July 25, 2011. To date, Schaeffler Group entities in Germany have refused service and have
not been properly served.

In Spain, a customer announced its intention to bring a claim for damages for the participation of
certain of our subsidiaries in a cartel in connection with the Spanish railway. Though we have not yet
received such claim, we intend to defend ourselves against this claim.

Our customers are increasingly requiring that provisions be included in sourcing contracts entitling
the respective customer to liquidated damages (pauschalisierter Schadensersatz) in the event of
antitrust violations and we also request such provisions in our sourcing contracts with our suppliers.
As a result, if such clauses are enforceable and if in the future we were to be found to have engaged
in any antitrust violations, we may be contractually required to pay substantial liquidated damages,
which could make follow-on civil damage claims even more likely.

See also “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We have been subject to industry-wide
_antitrust investigations, and civil lawsuits that have resulted in substantial fines and civil damages;_
_some of these are still ongoing.”_

_Product Liability Proceedings_

Although we aim to address any product-related risks proactively with careful product development
procedures and thorough quality management systems, we are frequently subject to claims related
to alleged violations of warranty obligations and alleged breaches of contract and we are also
frequently subject to product liability lawsuits and other proceedings alleging violations of due care,
recall campaigns or fines imposed by governments.

On February 23, 2023, the OEM Chrysler submitted a recall notification to the NHTSA. Chrysler is
recalling certain 2018-2023 Jeep Wranglers and 2020-2023 Jeep Gladiator vehicles equipped with
manual transmissions (the “Chrysler Recall”) because of the risk that the clutch pressure plate may
overheat and fracture, which may increase the risk of a fire and result in damage to other nearby
components, which can result in debris falling on the road or a loss of drive, increasing the risk of a
crash. We delivered clutches to Chrysler. We have been investigating whether our scope of supply
contributed to these risks. To our knowledge, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, a root
cause investigation is not yet completed. However, it is possible that Chrysler may seek to hold us
liable for this issue. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Chrysler has not submitted a claim
to us related to the Chrysler Recall.


-----

Furthermore, our group companies are involved in legal or administrative proceedings in Germany
and abroad in connection with product liability lawsuits and other proceedings, alleging violations of
due care, violations of warranty obligations, treatment errors, breach of contract, recall actions or
fines imposed by government or regulatory authorities. Although the outcome of these proceedings
is uncertain and the amounts involved in these proceedings may be substantial, we anticipate that an
unfavorable outcome in any proceedings currently ongoing, with the exception of the matter
described above, would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

_Contamination Claims_

On December 3, 2020, eight individuals filed a complaint in Jasper County, Missouri, against
Schaeffler Group USA Inc. and FAG Bearings LLC, alleging damages in an unspecified amount for
claims of strict liability, negligence, negligence per se, punitive damages, loss of consortium, wrongful
death, fraudulent concealment and conspiracy, resulting from toxic chemicals exposure, including
trichloroethylene (“TCE”). The plaintiffs were residents of the local community near the Joplin,
Missouri plant and claim exposure to TCE in the water, amongst other exposures allegedly caused by
FAG Bearings LLC in the area. The court denied our motion to dismiss Schaeffler Group USA Inc. from
the case, but did dismiss certain causes of action, namely, for strict liability, negligence per se and
punitive damages. Trial has been set for September 25, 2023. We intend to defend ourselves against
these claims.

On February 5, 2021, two individuals sued FAG Bearings LLC and Schaeffler Group USA Inc. in the
Circuit Court of Jasper County for damages in an unspecified amount for claims of strict liability,
negligence, punitive damages and loss of consortium resulting from toxic chemicals exposure,
including TCE, that allegedly caused the plaintiff’s multiple sclerosis. On February 23, 2022, the court
issued an order for summary judgement. The plaintiffs appealed the order for summary judgement.
Oral arguments were held on November 15, 2022 and we are currently awaiting the court’s ruling.
Should the appeal not be dismissed, we intend to continue to defend ourselves against these claims.


-----

## Regulatory Framework

We are subject to environmental and regulatory laws governing our business activities in the
countries in which we operate. These include, inter alia, laws regarding (i) air emissions, (ii) water
protection, (iii) waste treatment, (iv) soil and groundwater contamination, (v) handling, storage and
transport of hazardous goods and (vi) chemical substances. Furthermore, we are subject to
requirements on product safety and occupational health and safety as well as export control and
economic sanctions regulations. Moreover, the products manufactured by us have to comply with
various legal requirements. Applicability of the various regulations depends on the specific facilities,
installations and activities at each of our business locations and the type and use of each of the
products manufactured by us. For example, the permits and notifications required for a certain
facility depend on many factors, including the specific purpose of the facility, its capacity and physical
structure, the emissions produced by the facility, and the existence of any auxiliary facilities.

The environmental and regulatory laws applicable to us and our products are subject to change. They
are continuously being adapted, at national and international levels (especially by the EU), to the
level of technical sophistication, the increased need for safety and the recognition of environmental
aspects in political decisions.

Since a large number of our subsidiaries and/or production sites are located in EU member states and
since we generate a significant portion of our turnover within the EU, the following description
focuses on legal acts of particular relevance adopted by European institutions. Several of these legal
acts may be complemented by implementing additional (stricter) requirements established by
specific EU member states. In addition, this section includes summaries of the regulatory frameworks
applicable to our products in the United States and China, two markets outside the EU that are
important for us from a sales perspective.

### Regulatory Framework for our Operations and Products in Europe

The industrial sites operated by us have to comply with several environmental and regulatory
requirements, which can be enforced by the authorities and to a certain extent by competitors (e.g.,
via the competition laws) or by environmental non-governmental organizations based on their
broader access and action rights. In addition, environmental liabilities can occur due to public or civil
environmental laws. In the following paragraphs, the main legal sources in the EU for such
obligations or liabilities are summarized. The regulations applicable within each EU member state
may have distinctive characteristics, for instance, due to leeway with regard to the implementation
of EU directives into each EU member state’s legal system or within areas of law that have not yet
been harmonized fully or in parts at the EU level. We maintain site-specific registers listing all
applicable regulations with respect to environmental and regulatory requirements at every
production site worldwide which is regularly reviewed and updated by internal and external advisors.

**_Permits and Compliance_**

For the construction, operation and alteration of industrial facilities, such as production plants, we
generally need emission control permits or, alternatively, building permits and permits under water
laws. In the application process for such permits, the authority assesses whether the specific facility
the permit has been applied for will be in compliance with applicable provisions of environmental
and regulatory law, in particular, with regard to emissions, planning law and building regulations,
waste disposal, nature protection, occupational health and safety and, in the case of permits under
water law, use and disposal of water. As a general rule, the permits cover most environmental and
regulatory requirements that have to be met (e.g., with respect to emissions and occupational health
and safety). Some application procedures include public participation, e.g., the application procedure
for an emission control permit may include a public participation not limited to specific stakeholders.


-----

As a result of public participation, objections may be raised and thereby complicate and delay
procedures. Moreover, permits may be subject to legal proceedings initiated by third parties, namely
neighbors and environmental non-governmental organizations whose participation rights have been
expanded by the EU public participation directive (Directive 2003/35/EC, as last amended by
Directive 2016/2284/EU of the European Parliament (“EU Parliament”) and of the Council (“EU
**Council”) of December 14, 2016) and its interpretation by the European Court of Justice.**

Non-compliance with the requirements set out in specific permits and their ancillary conditions may
trigger administrative fines, and the responsible individuals may also be subject to criminal
prosecution. Furthermore, as a worst case scenario the authority may order a (partial) shutdown of
the facility and, under certain circumstances, revoke the permit.

_Industrial Emissions Control_

Directive 2010/75/EU of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of November 24, 2010 on industrial
emissions (the “IED”) stipulates that certain industrial installations, including installations for the
production and processing of metals, are generally required to have a permit. This permit can only be
issued by the competent authority if specified environmental conditions are met, e.g., if the operator
takes appropriate preventive measures against pollution and if the installation does not cause
significant pollution.

On April 5, 2022, the European Commission (the “EU Commission”) adopted a proposal to revise the
IED. In line with the European Green Deal, the overall aim of this proposal is to progress towards the
EU’s zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment and to support climate, energy and circular
economy policies. Inter alia, the new rules aim to ensure full and consistent implementation of the
IED across Member States, with tighter permit controls on air and water emissions.

The IED includes, inter alia, a regular authority review and update of permits in view of new technical
standards and enforcement. In addition, activities subject to a permit requirement under the IED
have to reach the standard of the “best available techniques” (“BAT”). The EU Commission will draw
up, review and, where necessary, have updated the BAT standards and issue the binding BAT
conclusions for the application of BAT in practice (e.g., specific thresholds, monitoring measures,
consumption levels). These binding BAT conclusions are published in best available technique
reference documents (“BREF”). BAT is a dynamic concept and continues to evolve as new measures
and techniques emerge, science and technologies develop and new or emerging industrial processes
are introduced. In order to reflect such developments and the consequences of such developments
for BAT, BREFs are subject to periodic review and update. For instance, the BREF for the Non-Ferrous
Metals Industries, which was adopted by the EU Commission in 2001, was published in 2022 in a
revised version. The most recent EU Commission implementing decision ((EU) 2022/2110), i.e., the
BAT conclusions, for the non-ferrous metals industries was published in November 2022. It is
currently expected that the EU Council will issue a statement in mid-March 2023 and that a final
report of the Committee of the European Parliament will be published in April 2023.

The IED requires a periodical review of the ancillary conditions in existing permits and, if necessary,
amendments of these conditions to ensure compliance with the IED. For example, this is a
characteristic in the German system where permits under the Federal Emission Control Act (Bundes_Immissionsschutzgesetz, BlmSchG) are as a rule unlimited in time and only subject to subsequent_
amendments to the extent they are proportionate. The requirement of iterative amendments of
existing permits may also apply to the installations operated by us as a few of our installations fall
within the scope of the IED.

For certain installations subject to the IED, there is a requirement relating to the status of the soil and
(ground) water. This requirement applies not only to new installations, but also to existing
installations if a permit is updated. For these installations, since January 7, 2013, the operator must
prepare and submit a baseline report on soil and groundwater contamination to the authorities in


-----

order to establish a reference situation for the case so that later installations are decommissioned.
Upon cessation of activities, the operator will be required to restore the environmental status
established in the baseline report. Also, there will be public access to these reports, enforcement and
other environmental information. This is expected to increase perception and costs of operating
industrial plants subject to the IED requirements.

In Germany, for example, the provisions of the IED were implemented into German law through
amendments to the Federal Emission Control Act, the Federal Water Management Act
(Wasserhaushaltsgesetz), the Law on Closed Cycle Management (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz) and
other environmental laws and ordinances.

_Due diligence in supply chains_

We will be required to comply with further due diligence obligations related to our supply chain. On
July 16, 2021, the German Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains Act (Gesetz über die
_unternehmerischen Sorgfaltspflichten in Lieferketten) was adopted. The law that entered into force_
on January 1, 2023, imposes due diligence and reporting obligations, with respect to the compliance
of companies’ supply chains with human rights and certain environmental standards. Since 2023, it
applies to companies with at least 3,000 employees in Germany, and from 2024, it will apply to
companies with at least 1,000 employees in Germany.

Furthermore, the customers we supply in Germany must also take appropriate measures vis-à-vis
their direct suppliers to ensure compliance with human rights and environmental obligations (insofar
as they are already in the scope of the new act).

In addition, on February 23, 2022, the EU Commission issued a proposal for a Directive on Corporate
Sustainability Due Diligence (COM(2022) 71 final) (the “Proposed EU Supply Chain Act”) at the EU
level that proposes to impose more extensive obligations on companies than the German Corporate
Due Diligence in Supply Chains Act. If it enters into force, the Proposed EU Supply Act will apply to all
EU companies with at least 500 employees and a net global turnover of at least €150 million. In
particular, such companies will have to ensure that (i) they integrate due diligence into all their
corporate policies and have a due diligence policy in place, (ii) they take appropriate measures to
identify actual and potential adverse human rights impacts and adverse environmental impacts
arising from their own operations, (iii) they establish and maintain a complaints procedure for
persons affected, (iv) make publicly communications on due diligence, (v) adopt a plan to ensure that
the business model and strategy of the company are compatible with the transition to a sustainable
economy and with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement. If a
company violates these obligations, it may be subject to sanctions or fines and victims will be able to
sue companies for damages related to non-compliance with its due diligence requirements.

**_Emissions from Production Processes_**

_Volatile Organic Compound Emissions_

We operate installations using volatile organic compounds (“VOC”). A few of those installations are
subject to requirements on VOC in the IED; hence, we are obliged to comply with its requirements as
implemented by national laws. On January 7, 2014 the IED replaced the EU Council Directive
1999/13/EC of March 11, 1999, complemented and amended by Directive 2004/42/EC of the EU
Parliament and of the EU Council of April 21, 2004 (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/1243)
and Directive 2008/112/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of December 16, 2008 (“VOC
**Directive”). The requirements on VOC in the IED in particular relate to substitution of hazardous**
substances as well as control and monitoring of emissions. The IED does not explicitly provide stricter
emission limits for VOC than the VOC Directive. It does, however, strengthen the importance of BAT
in the permitting procedure as well as in the course of a permit review.

**_Waste from Production Processes_**

As of December 12, 2010, Directive 2008/98/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of
November 19, 2008, as last amended by Directive (EU) No 2018/851 of the EU Parliament and of the
EU Council of May 30, 2018 (the “Waste Framework Directive”) redefined the legal framework on
waste treatment within the EU. We have to comply with the requirements of the Waste Framework
Directive as implemented by the national laws. This relates in particular to the disposal of waste from
production processes. The measures provided for in the Waste Framework Directive apply to all
substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard. They do not
apply to gaseous effluents, waste waters and some other types of waste which are subject to specific
EU rules.

The Waste Framework Directive introduced a waste hierarchy, i.e., the member states have to take
the following measures for the treatment of their waste (listed in order of priority): (i) prevention,
(ii) preparing for reuse, (iii) recycling, (iv) other recovery, including, notably, energy recovery, and
(v) disposal. Yet, as regards specific waste streams, EU member states may depart from the hierarchy
where this is justified by lifecycle thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management
of such waste.

EU member states must ensure that any original waste producer or holder carries out the treatment
of waste himself or has the treatment handled by a dealer or an establishment or undertaking which
carries out waste treatment or arranges treatment by a public or private waste collector in
compliance with the waste hierarchy and without endangering human health and without harming
the environment. In principle, EU member states have to require any establishment or undertaking
intending to carry out waste treatment to obtain a permit from the competent authority. Specific
activities not subject to a permit requirement need prior registration with public authorities. In
accordance with the “polluter pays” principle, the cost of waste management must be borne by the
original waste producer or by the current or previous waste holders.

Furthermore, the Waste Framework Directive strengthens waste prevention through the instruments
of producer responsibility and waste prevention programs. It also supports the recovery of waste by
stating obligations to separate waste and recycling targets for certain types of waste. The Waste
Framework Directive establishes a procedure to define criteria for by-products and the end of waste
status for specific production processes and waste streams, which will ensure legal certainty and
improve the acceptance of quality recycling products. It also clarifies the distinction between energy
recovery and disposal of waste by introducing energy efficiency criteria.

On July 4, 2018, the revised legislative framework on waste entered into force amending, inter alia,
the Waste Framework Directive. It sets clear targets for reduction of waste and establishes a longterm path for waste management and recycling. Inter alia, minimum requirements were established
for extended producer responsibility schemes to ensure that producers of products bear financial
responsibility for the management of the waste stage of a product’s life cycle.

On March 11, 2020, the EU Commission presented a new circular economy strategy (the “Circular
**Economy Action Plan 2020”). It is supposed to be one of the main building blocks of the European**
Green Deal, Europe’s new agenda for sustainable growth. The new plan focuses on the design and
production for a circular economy, with the aim to ensure that the resources used are kept in the EU
economy for as long as possible. The first initiative delivered under the new action plan was a
proposal for a new regulation on sustainable batteries adopted on December 10, 2020. This was
followed by additional proposals, including, inter alia, a revised regulation on waste shipments,
proposing stronger rules on waste exports, a more efficient system for the circulation of waste as a
resource and determined action against waste trafficking, which was adopted by the EU Commission
on November 17, 2021. On March 30, 2022, the EU Commission continued implementing the Circular
Economy Action Plan 2020 by adopting a package of measures such as the Sustainable Products
Initiative and a proposal for empowering consumers in the green transition.


-----

In March 2023, the EU Commission aims to adopt further initiatives under the Circular Economy
Action Plan 2020, such as a legislative proposal which will require companies to substantiate claims
they make about the environmental footprint of their products/services by using standardized
methods for quantifying them.

**_Packaging and Packaging Waste_**

Directive 94/62/EC of the EU Parliament and EU Council on packaging and packaging waste, as
amended (the “Packaging Directive”) covers all types of packaging and packaging waste used in the
European market. The Packaging Directive regulates what kind of packaging can be used in the EU
market, as well as packaging waste management and packaging waste prevention measures. All
packaging used in the EU market must comply with essential requirements related to its
manufacturing, composition, and reusable or recoverable nature.

As implementing the Circular Economy Action Plan 2020 is one of the main building blocks of the
European Green Deal, the EU Commission proposed to revise the Packaging Directive on November
30, 2022, with a feedback period that ended February 14, 2023, with the aim to ensure that all
packaging in EU market is reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030. The
proposed revision has three main objectives. First, to prevent the generation of packaging waste by
reducing it in quantity, restricting unnecessary packaging and promoting reusable and refillable
packaging solutions. Second, to boost high quality (“closed loop”) recycling by making all packaging in
the EU market recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030. And finally, to reduce the need for
primary natural resources and create a well-functioning market for secondary raw materials,
increasing the use of recycled plastics in packaging through mandatory targets.

In Germany, the Packaging Directive was implemented by the German Packaging Act
(Verpackungsgesetz, VerpackG). The German Packaging Act aims to promote recycling and re-use of
packaging and imposes certain obligations and requirements on manufacturers and distributors of
goods regarding the bringing into circulation and disposal of various packaging types. Inter alia,
manufacturers and distributors of goods are obligated to register with the central packaging register
(Zentrale Stelle Verpackungsregister) and participate in a dual packaging disposal and recycling
system. In July 2022, the German Packaging Act was amended and now provides for additional
regulations governing wholesale manufacturers of packaging, including registration and information
obligations.

**_Soil and Groundwater Contamination_**

We are currently carrying out remediation measures related to soil and groundwater contamination
at five manufacturing sites in Germany and at additional manufacturing sites, such as in France, Brazil
and the United States. We estimate the total costs for such measures in Germany at approximately
€25 million. Our operations include the use and storage of hazardous materials and can otherwise
have an impact on soil and groundwater. Other environmentally sensitive substances required for
the operation of sites, such as fuel and heating and lubricating oil, are used and stored at our sites. In
addition, many of the sites at which we operate have been used for various industrial purposes for
many years leading to risks of contamination and resulting site-restoration obligations. We could also
be held responsible for the remediation of areas adjacent to our sites or natural resources damages.
We cannot exclude that additional remediation measures related to these or other of our sites may
be required in the future. For a detailed description of the risks associated with the use of hazardous
material and possible soil, water and groundwater contamination, see “Risk Factors—Legal,
_Regulatory and Tax Risks—We could be held liable for soil, water or groundwater contamination or_
_for risks related to hazardous materials.”_

On the European level, liability for contamination of soil and groundwater has not, to date, been
subject to specific regulations or a protection policy. Some soil protection aspects can be found
scattered in various legal documents, hence different policies can contribute to protect soil. This is


-----

the case with many provisions in the existing environmental legislation in areas such as water, waste,
chemicals, industrial emissions, nature protection and pesticides. However, these provisions do not
establish a comprehensive soil protection regime including liability for soil and groundwater
contamination.

On November 17, 2021, the EU Commission adopted a new EU Soil Strategy for 2030. It provides the
framework and concrete steps towards protecting and restoring soils, and ensuring that they are
used sustainably. As part of this, a new Soil Health Law by 2023 has been announced to protect and
restore soils and ensure that they are used sustainably. The new law aims to help achieve healthy
soils by 2050, with concrete actions by 2030. It will do so by identifying the key soil threats in the EU,
such as erosion, floods and landslides, loss of soil organic matter, salinization, contamination,
compaction, sealing, as well as loss of soil biodiversity.

Moreover, on May 2, 2022, the 8th Environmental Action Program for the period 2021 to 2030
entered into force, as the EU’s legally agreed common agenda for environment policy until 2030. It
sets out priority objectives for 2030 and the conditions needed to achieve these objectives. Building
on the European Green Deal, the action program aims to speed up the transition to a climate-neutral,
resource-efficient economy.

In Germany, for example, liability for soil and groundwater contamination is set forth in the Federal
Soil Protection Act (Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz) in conjunction with the Federal Soil Protection and
Contamination Regulation (Bundes-Bodenschutz- und Altlastenverordnung). Both require specific
measures if certain thresholds of hazardous substances are exceeded. These measures include that
contamination of soil and groundwater must be explored, removed, reduced or, at least, prevented
from spreading onto adjacent sites or that its spreading is mitigated in the long term. If there is
reasonable suspicion that contamination of soil and groundwater may be present on a site, the
competent authority may order investigation measures to explore the contamination. If the suspicion
is confirmed, the authority may order remediation or containment measures.

Under the German Federal Soil Protection Act, both the present owner and the party currently in
control of the premises may be held liable by the authorities to undertake such measures which
often result in significant costs. The same applies to the party who caused the contamination, its
universal successor (Gesamtrechtsnachfolger) as well as to the former owner if it transferred
ownership after March 1, 1999, and was or must have been aware of the soil or groundwater
contamination. Furthermore, if a legal entity is liable for soil and groundwater contamination under
the aforementioned provisions, it cannot be ruled out that the shareholders in this entity may be
held liable in evident cases of circumvention of liability for soil and groundwater contamination. In all
cases of liability for soil and groundwater contamination, what actually caused an existing
contamination may be subject to controversy. Although the competent authorities are allowed to
issue remediation orders against the parties mentioned above, they usually aim for the most efficient
remediation by addressing such order to the party with the largest financial resources. If a party is
held liable by the authorities for soil and groundwater contamination, it may be indemnified by other
liable parties under the Federal Soil Protection Act. Yet, contractual agreements under civil law (e.g.,
guarantees and indemnities) do not protect against authority action. Such agreements may only
provide for reimbursement. Furthermore, contractual agreements may protect a party from
compensation claims of other liable persons under the Federal Soil Protection Act.

**_Water Use and Protection and Waste Water Treatment_**

We are subject to EU regulations on water use and protection (implemented by the applicable
national laws) as we extract water (e.g., from groundwater wells), use and dispose of it in the course
of our production processes.

Directive 2000/60/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of October 23, 2000, as last
amended by EU Commission Directive 2014/101/EU of October 30, 2014 (the “Water Framework


-----

**Directive”), includes a comprehensive approach to water protection. By means of the Water**
Framework Directive, the EU provides for the management of inland surface waters, groundwater,
transitional waters and coastal waters in order to prevent and reduce pollution, promote sustainable
water use, protect the aquatic environment, improve the status of aquatic ecosystems and mitigate
the effects of floods and droughts. EU member states must ensure that water pricing policies provide
adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently and that the various economic
sectors contribute to the recovery of the costs of water services, including those relating to the
environment and resources. Moreover, EU member states must introduce arrangements to ensure
that effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties are imposed in the event of breaches of the
national provisions implementing the Water Framework Directive. A list of priority substances
selected from among the ones which present a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment has
been drawn up using a combined monitoring-based and modeling-based procedure.

The list of 45 priority substances in the field of water policy is laid down in Annex X of the Water
Framework Directive. Twenty-one of the identified priority substances were classified as priority
hazardous substances and the EU member states are, as a rule, obliged to implement measures with
the aim of cessation or phasing out of emissions, discharges and losses of the relevant substances.
Furthermore, EU member states must apply environmental quality standards to all priority
substances. This is set out in Directive 2008/105/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of
December 16, 2008, last amended by Directive 2013/39/EU of August 12, 2013, which is a daughter
directive to the Water Framework Directive.

Groundwater is protected by both the Water Framework Directive and Directive 2006/118/EC of the
EU Parliament and of the EU Council of December 12, 2006, as last amended by the EU Commission
Directive 2014/80/EU of June 20, 2014 (“Groundwater Daughter Directive”), which is another
daughter directive to the Water Framework Directive. In particular, the Groundwater Daughter
Directive lays down detailed quality criteria for the assessment of the groundwater’s chemical status
including standards set on EU level and requirements for threshold values to be set at the EU
member state level. The Groundwater Daughter Directive contains criteria for the identification and
reversal of pollution trends and requires EU member states to establish measures to prevent the
input of hazardous substances into the groundwater and limit the introduction of other pollutants.

On October 26, 2022, the EU Commission published a proposal amending the Water Framework
Directive and the Groundwater Daughter Directive, which has been in EU Parliament’s committees
since late January 2023. The initiative updates the lists of priority substances for surface and
groundwater and their associated legal threshold values that are used to assess chemical status
under the Water Framework Directive. It also addresses monitoring and reporting of concentrations
and measures.

Discharge of waste water and its treatment is regulated by EU Council Directive 91/271/EEC of
May 21, 1991 (“Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive”), as last amended by EU Council Directive
2013/64/EU of December 17, 2013. This Directive concerns the collection, treatment and discharge
of urban waste water and the treatment and discharge of waste water from certain industrial
sectors. Its aim is to protect the environment from any adverse effects caused by the discharge of
such waters. The Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive is currently under revision. The EU
Commission proposal dated October 26, 2022, aims to better protect the health of Europeans and
the environment. More specifically, the revision aims to, inter alia, make industry responsible for
treating toxic micro pollutants that are released into the environment from the use of their products
(the “polluter pays” principle). To that end, the revised directive will introduce extended producer
responsibility in order to have the industry pay for the treatment of the harmful pollutants that are
released from the use of their products. The proposal concentrates on especially harmful residues
from the pharmaceutical and cosmetics sector. Going forward, the EU Commission will assess if other
sectors can be added to the extended producer responsibility scheme.

**_Control of Major-Accident Hazards involving Dangerous Substances_**

Directive 2012/18/EU of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of July 4, 2012, (“Seveso-III
**Directive”), successor of Directive 96/82/EC, with effect from June 1, 2015, lays down rules for the**
prevention of major accidents which involve dangerous substances, and the limitation of their
consequences for human health and the environment, with a view to ensuring a high level of
protection. We operate plants that are classified as “lower-tier establishments” and “upper-tier
establishments” where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or in excess of the
quantities listed in the Annex of the Seveso-III Directive.

According to the Seveso-III Directive, the operator is obliged to take all necessary measures to
prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences for human health and the environment. The
operator has to send a notification to the competent authority, including information such as the
immediate environment of the establishment, and factors likely to cause a major accident or to
aggravate the consequences thereof including, where available, details of neighboring
establishments, of sites that fall outside the scope of this directive, areas and developments that
could be the source of or increase the risk or consequences of a major accident and of domino
effects.

The operator is required to draw up a document in writing setting out the major-accident prevention
policy (“MAPP”) and to ensure that it is properly implemented. The operator shall periodically review
and where necessary update the MAPP, at least every five years. The operator of an upper-tier
establishment has to produce a safety report for the purpose of demonstrating that a MAPP and a
safety management system for implementing it have been put into effect. The operator also has to
draw up an internal emergency plan for the measures to be taken inside the establishment and to
supply the necessary information to the competent authority, to enable the latter to draw up
external emergency plans.

For upper-tier establishments it has to be ensured that all persons likely to be affected by a major
accident receive regularly and in the most appropriate form, without having to request it, clear and
intelligible information on safety measures and requisite behavior in the event of a major accident.

The EU member states have to ensure that appropriate safety distances between establishments
covered by the Seveso-III Directive and residential areas, buildings and areas of public use,
recreational areas, and, as far as possible, major transport routes are maintained. We may be subject
to restrictions, for instance, in respect of site locations of new plants and expansions to our existing
plants.

The provisions of the Directive 96/82/EC are implemented into German law primarily through the
Federal Hazardous Incident Regulation (Störfall-Verordnung) as well as, inter alia, the German
Federal Emission Control Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, BImSchG) and the German
Environmental Impact Assessment Act (Gesetz über die Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung, UVPG). Inter
_alia, new permit, notification and information requirements have been introduced._

Directive 2004/35/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of April 21, 2004, on environmental
liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (“ELD”), as last
amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of June 5, 2019,
establishes a framework of environmental liability based on the “polluter-pays” principle. The ELD
provides, in particular, that operators carrying out dangerous activities or specific activities listed in
the annexes to the ELD are liable for fault-based damage to protected species and natural habitats,
to water and to soil.

In May 2018, the EU Commission published a legislative proposal for a regulation on the alignment of
reporting policy (COM(2018) 381 final) and thereby amending, inter alia, the ELD. An evaluation of
the ELD published in June 2017 had found that the availability of information can be further
improved. Based on the EU Commission proposal, Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 of the EU Parliament


-----

and of the EU Council of June 5, 2019 on the alignment of reporting obligations in the field of
legislation related to the environment partly entered into force on June 26, 2019 and partly on
January 1, 2020. Further parts of the regulation entered into force on January 1, 2022. It aims at
streamlining reporting obligations, reducing administrative costs, improving the quality of available
data for future evaluations and increasing transparency.

**_Chemicals and Hazardous Substances_**

_REACH_

“REACH” is the Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals
(Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of December 18, 2006, as
last amended by EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2022/586 of April 8, 2022). As we use several
chemical substances and mixtures in the course of our production processes, we are subject to
REACH as importer or downstream user. REACH’s main objectives include improving the protection
of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals and ensuring
the free circulation of substances on the internal market of the EU. The EU Commission originally
planned to present a proposal for the revision of REACH at the end of 2022, but it was postponed and
is currently expected in 2023. The targeted revision, announced in the chemical strategy for
sustainability and the zero pollution action plan, has the aim of securing European competitive
advantages and innovation by promoting sustainable chemicals, simplifying and streamlining the
regulatory process, reducing burden and protecting human health and the environment.

REACH places greater responsibility on the industry to manage the risks that chemicals may pose to
health and the environment. Other legislation regulating chemicals (for example, on cosmetics and
detergents) or related legislation (e.g., on health and safety of workers handling chemicals, product
safety, construction products) not replaced by REACH continue to apply.

REACH applies to all chemical substances; however, under certain conditions, substances are
exempted from all or a part of the obligations under REACH. In principle, all manufacturers and
importers of chemicals must identify and manage risks linked to the substances they manufacture
and market. For substances produced or imported in quantities of one ton or more per year per
company, manufacturers and importers need to demonstrate that they have appropriately done so
by means of a registration dossier, which shall be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency
(“ECHA”). ECHA may then check that the dossier is compliant with REACH and will evaluate testing
proposals to ensure that the assessment of the chemical substances will not result in unnecessary
testing, especially on animals. Where appropriate, authorities may also select substances for a
broader substance evaluation to further investigate substances of concern.

REACH also provides for an authorization system aiming to ensure that substances of very high
concern are adequately controlled and progressively substituted by safer substances or technologies
or only used where society benefits overall from using the substance. These substances are
prioritized and gradually included in Annex XIV to REACH. Once they are included, the industry has to
submit applications to ECHA on authorization for continued use of these substances which are
otherwise prohibited. In addition, EU authorities can impose restrictions on the manufacture, use or
placing on the market of substances causing an unacceptable risk to human health or the
environment.

Manufacturers and importers must provide their downstream users with the risk information they
need to be able to use the substance safely. This is done via the classification and labeling system and
Safety Data Sheets (SDS), where needed. The requirements of REACH could result in restrictions for
chemicals that are used in our products or processes, which could in turn affect our ability to deliver
the respective products, see “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—Our operations are
_subject to stringent laws and regulations, particularly under applicable environmental laws, the_


-----

_violation of which could lead to significant liabilities” and “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax_
_Risks—We could become subject to additional burdensome environmental, safety or other regulations_
_and additional regulation could adversely affect demand for our products and services.”_

_Handling and Transport of Hazardous Goods_

We are involved in the carriage of hazardous goods, e.g., as loader and unloader of such goods and
are therefore subject to specific requirements related to such carriage. For example, at the
international level the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous
Goods by Road as of September 30, 1957 (Accord européen relatif au transport international des
_marchandises Dangereuses par Route, “ADR”), as last amended on January 1, 2023, includes_
provisions applicable to the carriage of dangerous goods on roads. Pursuant to the ADR, dangerous
goods, as a general rule, may be carried internationally in road vehicles subject to compliance with a
number of conditions, such as packaging and labeling requirements. Specific dangerous goods (e.g.,
goods which are poisonous and explosive at the same time) are excluded from carriage on the road.
The ADR has been implemented and supplemented by many EU member states (such as Germany).
Directive 2008/68/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of September 24, 2008 on the
inland transport of dangerous goods, as last amended by EU Commission Delegated Directive (EU)
2022/2407 of September 20, 2022, establishes a common regime for all aspects of the inland
transport of dangerous goods, by road, rail and inland waterways within the EU and incorporates the
ADR into European law.

_Bans and exemptions of chemicals_

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (“PoPs”) (the “Convention”) is an
international public law treaty that entered into force on May 17, 2004. As of December 31, 2022, it
has been ratified by more than 180 states as well as by the EU. The Convention aims to protect
human health and the environment from chemicals that remain intact in the environment for long
periods, become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the fatty tissue of humans and
wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health or on the environment. In response to this, the
Convention requires its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of PoPs into the
environment.

Historically, the Convention was implemented in the EU by Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the EU
Parliament and of the EU Council of April 29, 2004 which aligned the EU legislation with the
provisions laid down in the international agreements on PoPs. EU Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 was
repealed by Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of June 20, 2019
on persistent organic pollutants (“PoP Regulation”), last amended by EU Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2022/2291 of September 8, 2022.

The PoP Regulation lists substances that are subjected to restrictions with a view to their
manufacturing, placing on the market and use. Inter alia, the production, placing on the market and
use of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (PFOS) and the
use of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is regulated under the PoP Regulation. PFOA is used as an
emulsion stabilizer to manufacture polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) and other fluorinated polymers and
elastomers which has been used, for example, for the production of components for vehicles. On
December 29, 2022, Regulation (EU) 2022/2400 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of
November 23, 2022 amending Annexes IV and V to the PoP Regulation entered into force, tightening
the limits for certain POPs in waste. It introduces stringent limits in waste for perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA) (used in waterproof textiles and fire-fighting foams), dicofol (a pesticide formerly used in
agriculture), and pentachlorophenol (used in treated wood and textiles). Further, it tightens the
maximum limits in waste for another five substances that are already regulated. The regulation will
apply from June 10, 2023.


-----

**_Employee Health and Safety_**

Under national and international provisions, in most jurisdictions we are obliged to take measures
related to health and safety at work. In general, compliance with employment safety regulations is
subject to regulatory supervision.

**_Road Safety and Technical Standards_**

Our products for the automotive sector have to comply with road safety and technical standards and
requirements.

For the purpose of (passenger) safety and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market of
the EU, vehicle components and technical units have to comply with various requirements stipulated
in a large number of European legal acts. Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the EU Parliament and of the
EU Council of May 30, 2018, which was most recently amended by Delegated Regulation (EU)
2022/2236 of June 20, 2022) establishes a framework for the approval and market surveillance of
motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended
for such vehicles. The regulation became mandatory in all EU Member States on July 6, 2022. Its aim
is to achieve a high level of safety and environmental performance of vehicles. In this context, the
recitals of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 also stress measures relevant with respect to the operators in
the supply chain. In order to ensure that all vehicles, systems, components and separate technical
units placed on the market offer a high level of safety and of environmental protection, the
manufacturer or any other economic operator in the supply chain should take appropriate corrective
measures where they present a serious risk to users or the environment. Such corrective measures
explicitly include recalling vehicles.

In the course of the third mobility package “Europe on the move,” launched by the EU Commission,
the EU Parliament and the EU Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of November 27, 2019
(last amended by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1398 of June 8, 2022) amending Regulation (EU)
2018/858. The regulation entered into force on January 5, 2020 and applied from July 6, 2022. It
stipulates type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers as regards their general
safety and the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users. Following a fixed timetable
scheme, all new cars put on the EU market must be equipped with advanced safety systems to
ensure general safety, especially with regard to the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable
road users. Inter alia, it provides (i) for all motor vehicles to be equipped with accurate tire pressure
monitoring systems and safety features, (ii) for all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to be
equipped with automatic emergency braking systems (“AEBS”), a lane keeping system, event
(accident) data recorder, and an enlarged head impact protection zone, and (iii) for all buses and
trucks to be equipped with a lane departure warning system and AEBS. From July 6, 2022, EU typeapprovals will be denied for passenger cars and light vehicles that do not have these safety features
and from July 7, 2024, it will be prohibited to register vehicles or place them on the EU market
without AEBS. The necessary detailed technical requirements for individual safety measures are
being developed at EU and UNECE levels. It is expected that some of the existing security measures
will be enhanced and additional new security measures will be introduced.

In view of Brexit, on June 4, 2018, the EU Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on typeapproval legislation in the context of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. The Regulation
(EU) 2019/26 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of January 8, 2019 complementing Union
type-approval legislation with regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union
entered into force on the third day following its publication in the EU’s Official Journal on January 8,
2019. The regulation enables manufacturers of motor vehicles, systems, components and separate
technical units holding a UK type-approval to obtain a EU type-approval (i.e., a type-approval granted
by an approval authority of one of the EU member states), provided that the application for the EU
type-approval is made before the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. The draft regulation sets out the


-----

conditions for obtaining a EU type-approval and its effects on the placing in the EU market,
registration or entry into service of such vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units.
It also states that the authority issuing the EU type-approval will assume responsibility for in-service
conformity, repair and maintenance information and potential recalls also for vehicles, systems,
components and separate technical units put in the EU market on the basis of the UK type-approval.

In 2017, the EU Commission adopted Regulations (EU) No 2017/1151 (last amended by EU
Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/49 of January 21, 2020), (EU) No 2017/1154 and (EU) No
2017/1347 of July 13, 2017 amending former Directive 2007/46/EC concerning type-approval of
motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and
Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. The regulations ensure that,
since September 1, 2017, new vehicle type approvals pass new and more reliable emissions (RealDriving-Emissions – “RDE”) tests under real driving conditions. Until September 2017, emissions were
measured in a laboratory test during the registration process that takes place before the passenger
car is placed on the market. In view of the fact that the air pollutant emissions measured under real
conditions or on the road significantly exceeded the emissions measured in the laboratory test, the
EU Commission strengthened the emission testing procedure, among other things, by introducing the
RDE test, which checks emissions in real driving conditions. The EU Commission Regulation (EU)
2017/2400 of December 12, 2017 (last amended by EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2022/1379 of
July 5, 2022) defines the determination of the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of heavy-duty
vehicles.

The provisions of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of
January 15, 2013 (last amended by EU Regulation (EU) 2020/1694 of the EU Parliament and of the EU
Council of November 11, 2020) establishing approval and market surveillance requirements for
motorbikes/mopeds and squads in the EU entered into force on January 1, 2016. They aim to
upgrade EU’s functional safety and environmental requirements for L-category vehicles as a
prerequisite for vehicle registration.

In its Annex II, Part II, the Regulation (EU) 2018/858 refers to the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (“UNECE”) Regulations, which apply on a compulsory basis for the purpose of
EC type-approval of various categories of vehicles. The UNECE regulations listed in Annex IV are
based on the obligations of the “Agreement concerning the adoption of uniform technical
prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on
wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the bases of
these prescriptions” of March 20, 1958 (“1958 Agreement”), as amended on March 6, 2020
(C.N.235.2019.TREATIES-XI.B.16). The EU became party to the 1958 Agreement on March 24, 1998.
The 1958 Agreement allows the Contracting Parties (“CPs”) to adopt uniform technical prescriptions
for the approvals of vehicles, parts and equipment that can be fitted and/or used on vehicles and to
reciprocally recognize approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions. The 1958 Agreement
currently has 64 parties and 164 UNECE regulations annexed to it. Neither the United States nor
China are CPs to the 1958 Agreement.

Most UNECE regulations annexed to the 1958 Agreement cover parts and items of equipment of
motor vehicles that are relevant for granting of type approval for a category of vehicle in each of the
CPs (e.g., lamps, advanced emergency braking system, CO2 emission and fuel consumption). Most of
these UNECE regulations were adopted by a large majority of the CPs and integrated into their
national legislation.

In order to achieve a wider acceptance and application of these international vehicle regulations, the
World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (“WP.29”) adopted in its 169th session from
June 21, 2016 to June 24, 2016 the Revision 3 of the 1958 Agreement. The overall objective of this
reform is to accommodate the needs of countries with emerging automotive industries and markets
and to promote the principle of mutual recognition of certificates (“tested once, accepted


-----

everywhere”), while at the same time ensuring and maintaining the highest levels of safety and
environmental performance. The WP.29 invited the representative of EU to proceed with the
notification process.

Additionally, the WP.29 agreed in the mentioned session, inter alia, on the revision of a broad range
of UNECE regulations, in order to reflect the experiences and technical developments of the past
years. In view of laying down uniform provisions concerning the approval of brake assist systems,
electronic stability control, tire pressure monitoring systems and tire installation, the WP.29 adopted
four new UNECE regulations.

On January 22, 2020, UN Regulation No. 152 entered into force as an annex to the 1958 Agreement
(last amended on February 2, 2021). It imposes internationally harmonized requirements for the use
of Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (“AEBS”) at low speeds, even in complex and unpredictable
situations such as traffic in urban areas. Such systems employ sensors to monitor the proximity of the
vehicle or pedestrian in front and detect situations where the relative speed and distance between
the two vehicles or between the vehicle and pedestrian suggest that a collision is imminent. The
Regulation sets out test requirements for the deployment of AEBS at a range of different speeds,
from 0-60 km/h. In addition to cars, the Regulation will be applicable to all light commercial vehicles
(vans and minibuses with less than 9 passengers). The regulation was implemented into EU law via
Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 that entered into force on January 5, 2020.

An impact of our daily business is given with the UN Regulation No. 154 (last amended on August 18,
2021) which describes the uniform provisions concerning the approval of light duty passenger and
commercial vehicles with regards to criteria emissions, emissions of carbon dioxide and fuel
consumption and/or the measurement of electric energy consumption and electric range. The
intention of this Regulation is to establish uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor
vehicles with regard to the emissions of light-duty vehicles based on the new World harmonized Light
vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) included in UN GTR No. 15 and the updated Evaporative Emissions
test procedure (Type 4 test) which has been developed in UN GTR No. 19. It will enable CPs to issue
and accept approvals based on these new type approval tests. The WLTP testing requirements are
reflected in the Annexes to EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 of June 1, 2017 (last amended
by EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/49 of January 21, 2020). On July 5, 2022, EU Member States
adopted an amendment to the type-approval test procedure regulation for light-duty vehicles, (EU)
2017/1151 (referred to as EURO 6e Emission Standard), containing also a revision of the WLTP. It will
apply from September 1, 2023, but manufacturers are given the flexibility to begin type-approve
vehicles under the amended regulation from March 1, 2023, onwards. The Euro 6e amendments
reflect the adaptation to technical progress achieved in the WP.29 on the UN Regulation No. 154 for
the WLTP and in the draft UN Regulation on RDE and, moreover, refer directly to UN Regulation No.
154.

Even more relevant for our new business is the UN Regulation No. 155 related to uniform provisions
concerning the approval of vehicles with regards to cyber security and cyber security management
system. This regulation is in force since January 22, 2021. The regulation in particular requires vehicle
manufacturers to set up a Cyber Security Management System. However, it indirectly imposes
obligations on suppliers, as the manufacturer must demonstrate that supplier-related risks are
identified and managed and how dependencies with suppliers are managed. The regulation is
without prejudice to other UN Regulations, national or regional legislation governing the
development and installation/system integration of replacement parts and components, physical and
digital, with regards to cybersecurity. For instance, in Germany the Act on Autonomous Vehicles
(Gesetz zum autonomen Fahren) entered into force on 28 July 2021 and requires manufacturers of
autonomous vehicles over the entire period of development and operation to evidence vis-à-vis the
competent authority that electrical and electronic systems of the vehicles are protected against
cyber-attacks.


-----

The UNECE regulation No. 155 came hand in hand with the UN Regulation No. 156 which describes
uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regards to software update and software
updates management systems. This regulation came in force in as well on January 22, 2021. The
vehicle manufacturers are required to implement a Software Update Management System, which has
to be compliant with the standards set up by the UN, including detailed documentation
requirements. The regulation requires suppliers who bring specific software know-how to the
product to provide sufficient information so that the controls referred to in this regulation can be
properly carried out. Both, UN Regulation No. 155 and 156 have been implemented into EU law via
Regulation (EU) 2018/858 and via Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 that entered into force on January 5,
2020 and applied beginning on July 6, 2022. Both play an important role in practice and are affecting
us with considerable efforts and expenses. They will do so even more in our future day-to-day
business.

In addition, further UN Regulations have entered into force. In particular, under UN Regulation
No. 160, provisions concerning the approval of motor vehicles with regard to the Event Data
Recorder (“EDR”) were set out in order to ensure that EDRs record in a readily usable manner, data
valuable for effective crash investigations and for analysis of safety equipment performance. To
implement this, the EU Commission adopted the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/545 on
January 26, 2022 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 and applying since July 6, 2022.

On September 30, 2021, UN Regulation No. 163 entered into force as an annex to the 1958
Agreement. It imposes internationally harmonized requirements concerning the approval of vehicle
alarm systems (“VAS”) and approval of a vehicle with regard to its VAS. The regulation is applicable to
passenger cars and light weight vehicles with a maximum weight of not more than 2 tons. It sets out
the requirements under which an approval will be necessary and the technical requirements for the
VAS.

The “Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles,
equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles of June 25, 1998”
(“1998 Agreement”), last amended on June 14, 2022, applies in parallel to the 1958 Agreement. The
purpose of the 1998 Agreement is to further improve the process of international harmonization
through the development of UN global technical regulations (“GTRs”). The main difference compared
to the 1958 Agreement is that the 1998 Agreement does not provide for the mutual recognition of
approvals granted on the basis of global technical regulations. The 1998 Agreement stipulates that
contracting parties will establish, by consensus vote, UN GTRs in a UN Global Register. The UN GTR
contains globally harmonized performance requirements and test procedures. The 1998 Agreement
currently has 38 parties and 23 UN GTRs that have been entered into the Global UN Registry. For
instance, current GTRs include UN GTR No. 2 “Measurement procedure for two-wheeled motorcycles
equipped with a positive or compression ignition engine with regard to the emission of gaseous
pollutants, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption,” UN GTR No. 8 “Electronic stability control systems”
and GTR No. 20 “Electric Vehicle Safety (EVS).”

Furthermore, there is a list of candidates for harmonization or adoption as GTRs, inter alia, heavyduty engine and vehicle standards and highway diesel fuel sulfur control requirements. Moreover,
the WP.29 may submit proposals to develop and harmonize the vehicle regulations, for example, the
“Proposal for an Electric Vehicle Regulatory Reference Guide” submitted by the working party on
pollution and energy that was adopted in November 2014.

**_Emissions from Vehicles_**

Regulatory requirements related to emissions and noise from all vehicles required to be registered,
including two-wheelers, are relevant to our business as set out below. We continuously develop our
products in accordance with the regulatory requirements applicable to noise and pollutants
emissions.


-----

_Noise Emissions_

Noise emissions are regulated by the EU Council Directive 70/157/EEC of February 6, 1970 as last
amended by EU Council Directive 2013/15/EU of May 13, 2013. This directive lays down limits for the
noise level of the mechanical parts and exhaust systems of the vehicles concerned. The limits range
from 74 dB(A) for motor cars to 82 dB(A) for high-powered goods vehicles. This Directive will be
repealed with effect from July 1, 2027 by the Regulation (EU) No 540/2014 of the EU Parliament and
of the EU Council of April 16, 2014 (last amended by EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)
2019/839 of March 7, 2019) (“Regulation (EU) No 540/2014”) which also amends Directive
2007/46/EC. The Regulation (EU) No 540/2014 establishes the administrative and technical
requirements for the EU type-approval of new vehicles of specific categories with regard to their
sound level and of replacement silencing systems and components. The amendments implemented
by EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/1576 of June 26, 2017, were intended to improve
the accuracy of acoustic vehicle alerting system (“AVAS”) requirements on type and volume of
emitted sound, sound generation method, pause switch and stationary sound. By way of the most
recent amendment implemented under Regulation (EU) 2019/839, measures concerning the AVAS
for hybrid electric and pure electric vehicles have been set out.

Furthermore, under Regulation (EU) No 540/2014 the test method for vehicle noise emissions
established under Directive 70/157/EEC will be replaced by a new test method recognized
internationally and better reflecting present driving behavior. It was developed under the auspice of
the UNECE.

_Pollutant Emissions_

Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”)

With regard to carbon dioxide emissions of new passenger cars, initially Regulation (EC) No 443/2009
of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of April 23, 2009, as last amended by EU Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/649 of January 23, 2018 (“Regulation 443/2009”) limited the
average carbon dioxide emissions of the new car fleet in the EU by setting a target of 95 grams of
carbon dioxide per kilometer from 2020 onwards. With regard to carbon dioxide emissions of light
commercial vehicles (class N1), Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the EU Parliament and of the EU
Council of May 11, 2011, as last amended by EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/986 of
March 7, 2019 (“Regulation 510/2011”), limited the average emissions of new light commercial
vehicles registered in the EU to 147 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer from 2020 onwards.

Both regulations, i.e. Regulation 443/2009 and Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, were repealed with
effect from January 1, 2020 by Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council
of April 17, 2019, as last amended by EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1961 of August
5, 2021 (“Regulation 2019/631”), setting CO2 emission performance standards for both, new
passenger and new light commercial vehicles (produced by manufacturers inside or outside the EU)
and, in particular, changing the test procedure which is basis for the calculation of fleet limits from
the “New European Driving Cycle” (the “NEDC”) to the new “Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles
Test Procedure” (the “WLTP”). As did previous Regulations, Regulation 2019/631 stipulates fleetwide targets, i.e. each manufacturer (inside or outside the EU) has to fulfill an individual emissions
target calculated on the basis of the individual manufacturer’s fleet. The emission limits are
calculated as a function of their mass. Manufacturers may form a pool in order to meet their targets.
Where two or more manufacturers form a pool, the pool will be treated as if it were one
manufacturer for the purposes of determining its compliance with the targets. If a manufacturer
exceeds the fleet limit, it has to pay €95 per gram of excess per number of newly registered vehicles.

From 2020 onwards, a target of 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer for 95% of the
manufacturer’s new passenger car fleet applies, i.e. 5% of the fleet with the highest emissions are not


-----

taken into account. With respect to new light commercial vehicles, a target of 147 grams of carbon
dioxide per kilometer for 95% of the manufacturer’s new light commercial vehicle car fleet applies.
However, in 2020, all fleet limits were still being calculated on the basis of the NEDC, which was the
prescribed test procedure for determining CO2 and pollutant emissions from 1992 to 2018.

From 2021 until 2024, for both new passenger and light commercial vehicles, the aforementioned
targets shall apply to 100% of the manufacturer’s fleet. Also from 2021, for both new passenger and
new light commercial vehicles, the fleet limits are calculated on the basis of the WLTP replacing the
former NEDC, which no longer adequately reflects current driving conditions and vehicle
technologies. As a result of the change of the specification to the new WLTP test procedure, it is
expected that the nominal consumption value will increase by an average of around 20%.

Moreover, Regulation 2019/631 stipulates that from January 2025, for the average emissions of both
the new passenger car fleet and the new light commercial vehicles fleet, an EU fleet-wide target
equal to a 15% reduction of the 2021 target will apply. From January 2030, for the average emissions
of the new passenger car fleet an equal to a 37.5% reduction of the 2021 target will apply and for the
average emissions of the new light commercial vehicles fleet, an EU fleet-wide target equal to a 31%
reduction of the 2021 target will apply.

On July 14, 2021, as part of the so-called “Fit for 55” legislative package, the EU Commission
presented a proposal for a regulation amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to strengthen the CO2
emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles in line
with the EU’s increased climate ambition in order to help accelerate the transition to low- and zero
emission vehicles. The proposal aims to accelerate the transition by requiring average CO2 emissions
of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to be reduced by 55% by 2030 and 100% by
2035, each as compared to 2021 levels. This would also mean that all new vehicles registered on or
after January 1, 2035 would be required to have zero CO2 emissions and incentives for zero and lowemission vehicles would no longer apply from 2030. The EU Parliament and the EU Council adopted
their positions in June 2022; a trilogue agreement on the proposal was reached on October 27, 2022.
The agreed text was formally adopted by the EU Parliament on February 14, 2023 and needs to be
formally adopted by the EU Council before publication in the EU’s Official Journal.

On February 14, 2023, the EU Commission presented a proposal for a regulation amending
Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 to strengthen the CO2 emission performance standards for new heavyduty vehicles and integrating reporting obligations to reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector.
The proposal includes requiring average CO2 emissions of most new heavy duty vehicles to be
reduced by 45% by 2030, 65% by 2035 and 90% by 2040, each as compared to 2019 levels. In
addition, to accelerate the deployment of zero-emission buses in cities, the proposal would also
require all new city buses to have zero CO2 emissions as of 2030. Before the proposed regulation is
published in the EU’s Official Journal, it will need to be formally adopted by the EU Parliament and
the EU Council.

The WLTP was introduced by EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 of June 1, 2017 (last
amended by EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/49 of January 21, 2020). The WLTP was developed
with the aim of being used as a global test cycle across different world regions, so pollutant and CO2
emissions as well as fuel consumption values would be comparable worldwide. However, while the
WLTP has a common global ‘core’, the EU and other regions will apply the test in different ways
depending on their road traffic laws and needs. It is carried out on the chassis dyno test bench and
replaced the former NEDC. Since September 1, 2017, new car models have to pass the WLTP before
they can be driven on European roads. On September 1, 2018, the test became mandatory for all
new cars and all light duty vehicles sold after this date. Shortly after the introduction of the WLTP,
the EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 was amended by EU Commission Regulation (EU)
2018/1832 of November 5, 2018 (“WLTP 2nd Act”) for the purpose of improving the emission type
approval tests and procedures for light passenger and commercial vehicles. Since January 1, 2019,


-----

new measurements have to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of this regulation. Inter
alia, all new passenger and light commercial vehicles must be fitted with an On-board Fuel and/or
Energy Consumption Monitoring Device (“OBFCM”) from January 1, 2020. This software records the
fuel consumption of vehicles and the energy consumption of electric or plug-in hybrid cars. However,
the WLTP 2nd Act only contains the requirement to install an OBFCM device. How the CO2 values are
recorded and evaluated must still be specified by the legislator. This was subject of the work being
carried out by the “Obm Task Force,” which the EU Commission mandated to develop a technical
solution by the end of 2020. With the WLTP 2nd Act, the EU Commission adopted all changes to the
global WLTP framework that have been decided upon at the United Nations level by way of the
Global Technical Regulation No. 15 Amendment 6 and, moreover, added several provisions valid only
in Europe. All vehicles newly approved in the EU must fulfill the requirements of the new procedure
by September 2019.

With respect to carbon dioxide emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and trucks, Regulation (EU)
2019/1242 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of June 20, 2019 (“Regulation 2019/1242”)
limits the carbon dioxide emissions from trucks and buses. It applies to new heavy-duty vehicles of
categories N2 and N3. Compared to the EU average in the reference period (July 1, 2019 to June 30,
2020) emissions shall be reduced by 15% from 2025 onwards and by 30% from 2030 onwards. The
2025 target can be achieved using technologies that are already available on the market. The 2030
target will be assessed in 2022 as part of the review of the Regulation. Regulation 2019/1242 applies
to four categories of large trucks, which together account for 65 to 70% of emissions from heavyduty vehicles. The EU Commission proposed to review the legislation in 2022 to fix the target for
2030 and extend its application to smaller trucks, buses, coaches and trailers. By 2023, the EU
Commission shall evaluate the possibility of developing a common methodology for the assessment
and reporting of the full life-cycle CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles. On December 20, 2021, the
EU Commission opened public consultation on the revision of Regulation 2019/1242, which ended on
March 14, 2022. The EU Commission adopted the proposal on the revision of the CO2 standards for
heavy duty vehicles on February 14, 2023.

Furthermore, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of January 15,
2013 (last amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/1694 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of
November 11, 2020) includes specific emission thresholds for two- and three-wheelers and
quadricycles. In case of powered cycles, mopeds and light quadricycles, these thresholds apply as of
January 1, 2017, for new vehicles and as of January 1, 2018, for existing vehicles. In case of
motorcycles, tricycles and heavy quadri-mobiles, these thresholds apply as of January 1, 2016, for
new vehicles and as of January 1, 2017, for existing vehicles.

Air pollution

On November 10, 2022, the EU Commission presented a proposal to reduce air pollution from new
motor vehicles sold in the EU to meet the European Green Deal’s zero-pollution ambition (Proposal
COM (2022) 586 final). The Euro 7 emission standards are needed to set more ambitious limits for air
pollutants and will ensure that cars, vans, lorries and buses are much cleaner, in real driving
conditions that better reflect the situation in cities where air pollution problems are largest, and for a
much longer period than under current rules. The proposal tackles emissions from tailpipes as well as
from brakes and tires.

The proposal replaces and simplifies previously separate emission rules for cars and vans (Euro 6) and
lorries and buses (Euro VI) by implementing emission limits for all motor vehicles, i.e., cars, vans,
buses and lorries under a single set of rules. The new emission standards are fuel- and technologyneutral, placing the same limits regardless of whether the vehicle uses petrol, diesel, electric drivetrains or alternative fuels. They will also set emission limits for previously unregulated pollutants,
such as nitrous oxide emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. Moreover, Euro 7 emission standards will
be the first worldwide emission standards to move beyond regulating exhaust pipe emissions and set


-----

additional limits for particulate emissions from brakes and rules on micro plastic emissions from tires.
Currently, Euro 6 standard cars must comply with the emission requirements only up to 100,000
kilometers or 5 years of use. To better reflect the lifecycle of vehicles, the Euro 7 emission standards
will need to be respected up to 200,000 kilometers and 10 years of use. Both light- and heavy-duty
vehicles will need to be equipped with on-board emissions monitoring systems (OBM). The Euro 7
emission standards do not address CO2 emissions from road vehicles. These are the subject of
separate EU regulations for light- and heavy-duty vehicles.

According to the EU Commission’s proposal, the date for the entry into force of the new regulation
will be July 1, 2025 for new light-duty vehicles (cars and vans), and July 1, 2027 for new heavy-duty
vehicles (lorries and buses). Limited exceptions apply to vehicles constructed by small volume
manufacturers in light of specific technology constraints. The EU Commission’s proposal will be
submitted to the EU Parliament and the EU Council in view of its adoption by the co-legislators.

Greenhouse Gases

Moreover, the EU aims to promote the use of biofuels as a replacement for diesel or gas in order to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Former Directive 2009/28/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU
Council of April 23, 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources was
repealed with effect from July 1, 2021 by the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the EU Parliament and of
the EU Council of December 11, 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources
as last amended by the EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/759 of December 14, 2021
(“RED II”), which entered into force on December 22, 2018. Accordingly, EU member states shall
collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the EU’s gross final
consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 32%, including a transportation-specific sub target of at
least 14% of all energy in road and rail transport fuels. In 2021, the EU Commission proposed
amendments to RED II as a part of the “Fit for 55” Legislative package. Inter alia, the proposal seeks
to convert the 14% target for renewable energy in transport to a greenhouse gas intensity reduction
target of 13%, better aligning it with the EU’s 2030 climate goals. This would allow for fuels to instead
be counted towards the 13% reduction target, based on their greenhouse gas saving.

**_Disposal, Reuse, Recycling and Recovery of Motor Vehicles_**

Regulatory requirements related to disposal, reuse, recycling and recovery of motor vehicles as set
out below apply to our customers in the automotive industry. Furthermore, we are legally obliged to
support our customers in fulfilling such requirements. We therefore assist our customers by
continuously developing our products in accordance with the regulatory requirements applicable to
the products of our customers.

Directive 2000/53/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of September 18, 2000 on end-of
life vehicles, last amended by EU Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2020/363 of December 17,
2019 (“ELV Directive”), stipulates measures to prevent waste arising from end-of-life vehicles and to
promote the collection, reuse and recycling of vehicle components. Waste prevention is the priority
objective of the ELV Directive. To this end, it stipulates that vehicle manufacturers supported by
material and equipment manufacturers like us must: (i) endeavor to reduce the use of hazardous
substances when designing vehicles; (ii) design and produce vehicles which facilitate the dismantling,
reuse, recovery and recycling of end-of-life vehicles; (iii) increase the use of recycled materials in
vehicle manufacture; and (iv) ensure that components of vehicles placed on the market after July 1,
2003, do not contain mercury, hexavalent chromium, cadmium or lead, except for the cases listed in
Annex II of the ELV Directive and under the conditions specified therein. Most spare parts that are
put on the market after July 1, 2003 and used for vehicles put on the market before July 1, 2003 are
excluded.


-----

The EU Commission carried out an evaluation of the ELV Directive to identify good and bad practices
in its implementation and assess whether it has met its objectives. Currently, the EU Commission is
reviewing it in light of the Circular Economy Action Plan 2020. The revision seeks to promote more
circularity by linking design issues to end-of-life treatment, considering rules on mandatory recycled
content for certain materials of components and improving recycling efficiency. The EU Commission
envisages to merge Directive 2000/53/EC and Directive 2005/64/EC of October 26, 2005 on the type
approval of motor vehicles with regard to their reusability, recyclability and recoverability into a
single instrument, covering the whole life cycle of the automotive sector. The legislative proposal, to
be accompanied by an impact assessment, was expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, but has not
yet been published. On December 16, 2022, a legislative proposal was published in regards to the
exemptions for the use of lead in aluminum alloys for machining purposes, in copper alloys and in
certain batteries.

**_Product Safety and Liability_**

_Product Safety_

We have to comply with requirements for product safety as well as specific applicable provisions
(e.g., standards for automotive products).

Directive 2001/95/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of December 3, 2001 (last amended
by Regulation (EC) No 596/2009 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of June 18, 2009) on
general product safety (the “General Product Safety Directive”) applies in the absence of specific
provisions among the EU regulations governing the safety of products concerned, or if sectorial
legislation is insufficient. Under this Directive, manufacturers must put on the market only products
which comply with the general safety requirement.

A safe product is one which poses no threat or only a reduced threat in accordance with the nature
of its use and which is acceptable in view of maintaining a high level of protection for the health and
safety of persons. In addition to compliance with the safety requirement, manufacturers must
provide consumers with the necessary information in order to assess a product’s inherent threat,
particularly when this is not directly obvious, and take the necessary measures to avoid such threats
(for example, withdraw products from the market, inform consumers, recall products which have
already been supplied to consumers etc.). In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market
surveillance and compliance of products (the “Market Surveillance Regulation”), each economic
operator is also obliged to supply products that comply with the general safety requirement, to
monitor the safety of products on the market and to provide the necessary documents ensuring that
the products can be traced. If any economic operator discovers that a product is dangerous, they
must notify the competent authorities and, if necessary, cooperate with them. The Market
Surveillance Regulation prohibits the placing on the market of certain goods unless an economic
operator established in the EU is identified as responsible for ensuring the availability of the
conformity documentation, cooperating with market surveillance authorities and informing
authorities when they have reasons to believe that a product presents a risk. Appointed national
authorities are responsible for market surveillance. They check whether products available on the
market are safe, ensure product safety legislation and rules are applied by manufacturers and
business chains and apply sanctions when necessary. Moreover, national authorities notify the EU
Commission by using RAPEX, an information system for the rapid exchange of information between
the EU member states and the EU Commission on measures and action taken in relation to products
posing a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers.

In a resolution of November 25, 2020 (2019/2190(INI)) the EU Parliament called for a revision of the
General Product Safety Directive and urged the EU Commission to update and establish aligned
market surveillance rules for both harmonized and non-harmonized products placed on the market
offline or online, and to make them fit for purpose in the digital age in order to ensure a level playing


-----

field and improve product safety. In June 2021, the EU Commission adopted a proposal for a new
general product safety regulation (COM(2021) 346 final). The proposal mainly contains regulations
with regard to the responsibility for products placed on the market, improved recall rules and
consumer remedies in case of a recall. Both the EU Parliament as well as the EU Council are currently
working on the proposal.

_Product Liability_

We are subject to product liability regulations and may therefore be held liable for damages caused
by a defective or nonperforming product manufactured by us. Liability for defective or
nonperforming products may in particular be based on the provisions of civil and tort law of the
individual EU Member States, but also on criminal law.

On the EU level, EU Council Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985, as amended by Directive
1999/34/EC of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of May 10, 1999 (the “Product Liability
**Directive”), introduced a system of objective liability, i.e., liability without fault of the producer, in**
cases of damage caused by a defective product. The Product Liability Directive applies to movables
which have been industrially produced, whether or not incorporated into another movable or into an
immovable. “Producer” means the manufacturer of a finished product, the producer of any raw
material or the manufacturer of a component part and any person who, by putting his name,
trademark or other distinguishing feature on the product presents himself as its producer. Any
person who imports into the EU a product for sale, hire, leasing or any form of distribution in the
course of his business shall be deemed to be a producer. Where the producer of the product cannot
be identified, each supplier of the product is treated as its producer unless he informs the injured
person of the identity of the producer or of the person who supplied him with the product. The same
applies in the case of an imported product, if this product does not indicate the identity of the
importer.

“Defectiveness” means lack of the safety which the general public is entitled to expect given, inter
_alia, the presentation of the product and the use to which it could reasonably be put._

Producers can be cleared of liability under certain conditions, notably, if they prove that they did not
put the product into circulation, the defect was due to the compliance of the product with
mandatory regulations issued by public authorities or the state of scientific or technical knowledge at
the time the product was put into circulation could not detect the defect.

The Product Liability Directive applies to damage caused by death or by personal injuries and damage
to an item of property intended for private use or consumption other than the defective product,
with a lower threshold of a €500 damage caused by defective products. It sets out a time limit of
3 years for the recovery of damages and forbids clauses limiting or excluding the liability of the
producer. The Product Liability Directive does not restrict compensation for non-material damage
under national legislation.

Starting in 2019, the EU Commission was carrying out a formal evaluation of the Product Liability
Directive due to an increasing need for updating the existing product liability rules to make them fit
for the digital age and the circular economy, including for the ‘new’ types of goods that to a greater
extent come to shape the future economy of Europe. The EU Commission intended to produce
guidance to address the way in which the Product Liability Directive applies to artificial intelligence,
robotics and the Internet of Things and on its broader implications.

In October 2021, the EU Commission launched a public consultation on the revision of the Product
Liability Directive with a focus on liability rules in the digital age and artificial intelligence. On
September 28, 2022, the EU Commission published its proposal for revising the Product Liability
Directive. The proposed revision of the Directive is intended to modernize and reinforce the current
well-established rules, based on the strict liability of manufacturers, for the compensation of


-----

personal injury, damage to property and data loss caused by unsafe products. Under current
legislation, companies are obliged to compensate people injured by defective products. According to
the proposal, the Product Liability Directive will require companies to also disclose evidence that a
claimant would need to prove their case in court. In addition, the EU Commission’s proposal, once it
has entered into force, would introduce provisions ensuring that there should always be a business
or legal representative based in the EU that can be held liable for defective products bought directly
from manufacturers outside the EU. In order to become law, the EU Commission’s proposal will need
to be adopted by the EU Parliament and the EU Council.

**_Energy Efficiency_**

Directive 2012/27/EU of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of October 25, 2012 (last amended
by Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of June 5, 2019) (“EED
**Directive”), requires all enterprises except for small or medium-sized enterprises to carry out energy**
audits.

The revised EED Directive establishes a binding EU target of at least 32.5% efficiency improvements
for 2030. With the exception of certain provisions, the revised EED Directive was to be transposed
into national legislation by June 25, 2020. The EU Commission is required to evaluate the functioning
of the revised EED Directive by 2023, and could accompany this review with a legislative proposal
that raises the headline target.

On July 14, 2021, the EU Commission published a proposal for recasting the EED Directive, forming
part of the EU Commission package of proposals “Delivering on the European Green Deal.” It seeks to
introduce a higher target for reducing primary (39%) and final (36%) energy consumption by 2030
that is binding at the EU level, an increase from the current target of 32.5%. In addition, the proposed
directive introduces a benchmarking system for EU member states to set their national indicative
contributions to the binding EU target. The new directive also proposes to nearly double EU member
states annual end use energy savings obligations. To stimulate this acceleration, the proposal focuses
on sectors with high energy-savings potential, notably heating and cooling, industry and energy
services. In May 2022, the EU Commission updated the proposed target for overall energy savings,
raising it from 9% to 13% and began discussions for a much more ambitious target of 14.5%.

In Germany, the EED Directive has been implemented by a Federal law on energy services (Gesetz
_über Energiedienstleistungen und andere Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen). Accordingly, energy audits_
are, as a rule, mandatory on a four-year basis. On November 26, 2019, the amended Federal law on
energy services implementing the revised EED Directive into German law entered into force. Inter
alia, companies subject to energy audits are now required to submit an online energy audit
declaration to the Federal Office for Export and Economic Control (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und
_Ausfuhrkontrolle,_ _BAFA)._

**_Regulations on Aeronautical Products, Parts and Appliances_**

As we manufacture aeronautical products, parts and appliances, we have to comply with the
following regulatory requirements:

The design, production and maintenance of aeronautical products, parts and appliances was initially
regulated by Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of February 20,
2008, as last amended by EU Commission Regulation (EU) 4/2016 of January 5, 2016, as a basic
regulation. As of September 11, 2018, this regulation was repealed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of
the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of July 4, 2018 (last amended by EU Commission Regulation
(EU) 2021/1087 of April 7, 2021) on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The principal objective of this regulation is to
establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety across Europe. Inter alia, the new
regulation includes essential requirements for the design, production, maintenance, the noise and


-----

emission requirements and operation of unmanned aircraft and, thus, aims to ensure the safe use of
unmanned aerial systems. Accordingly, unmanned aircraft systems need to be designed and used in a
way that they do not put people at risk.

Moreover, detailed requirements for the design and production of aeronautical products are
provided by EU Commission Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 of August 3, 2012, as last amended by EU
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/203 of February 14, 2022 (“Regulation 748/2012”).
Furthermore, detailed requirements for the maintenance of aeronautical products are included in EU
Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 of November 26, 2014, as last amended by EU
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/410 of March 10, 2022.

Under Regulation 748/2012, an organization responsible for the design of products, parts and
appliances related to aircraft requires a design organization approval (“DOA”) according to Annex I to
Regulation 748/2012 (so-called “Part 21”), Subpart J. The holder of DOA is entitled to perform design
activities under Part 21 within the scope approved in DOA. Furthermore, the EASA will accept specific
compliance documents submitted by the holder of the DOA without further verification.

The production of several products, parts and appliances related to aircraft requires a production
organization approval (“POA”) according to Part 21, Subpart G. The POA demonstrates conformity of
the manufactured products, parts and appliances with their applicable design data.

In addition, organizations involved in the maintenance of large aircrafts and related components
require a maintenance organization approval (“MOA”) according to Annex II to EU Commission
Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. The holder of a MOA is entitled to, for example, maintain any aircraft
or component at the sites for which the holder is approved according to the MOA and the
maintenance organization exposition relating to the MOA.

EU Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1142 amended Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 by introducing
additional categories of Aircraft Maintenance Licenses, modifying the acceptance procedure of
components from external suppliers and by modifying the maintenance training organizations’
privileges. It is, too, to ensure a high and uniform level of aviation safety at Union level and to reduce
potential safety risks that may arise from a shortage of qualified personnel.

**_Regulations on Artificial Intelligence_**

The EU Parliament and the EU Council set out a proposal for a regulation of laying down harmonized
rules on artificial intelligence (“Artificial Intelligence Act”) of April 21, 2021 (COM(2021)206 final). It
intends to regulate the use of artificial intelligence, but not the technology itself, and prohibits the
use of artificial intelligence systems in certain application scenarios or makes their use dependent on
technical and organizational requirements. The Artificial Intelligence Act would apply to providers
placing on the market or putting into service AI systems, such as robotics specialists, in the EU and to
AI users. In December 2022, the EU Council of the EU approved a compromised version of the
proposed Artificial Intelligence Act. In order to become law, it will next have to be adopted by the EU
Parliament.

**_Regulations on Products for Rail Vehicles_**

As we manufacture products for rail vehicles we have to comply, inter alia, with the following
regulatory requirements:

Products for rail vehicles are subject to several regulations on EU level. With effect from June 16,
2020, Directive (EU) No 2016/797 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of May 11, 2016 on the
interoperability of the rail system within the EU (last amended by Directive (EU) No 2020/700 of the
EU Parliament and of the EU Council of 25 May 2020 as regards the extension of the transposition
periods) came into force. Moreover, Directive 2004/49/EC was repealed by Directive (EU) No
2016/798 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of May 11, 2016 (last amended by Regulation
(EU) 2020/1530 of October 21, 2020) on railway safety with effect from June 16, 2020. Both


-----

Directives have been adopted in the course of the “Fourth Railway Package,” its purpose being to
eliminate the national administrative and technical barriers between the different EU member states,
which are considered to be a hindrance to the interoperability and to reduce costs of railways in
order to increase the competitiveness of the railway sector. These directives were supplemented by
Regulation (EU) 2016/796 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of May 11, 2016 on the
European Union Agency for Railways. In particular, these regulations concern the design,
construction, placing in service, upgrading, renewal, operation and maintenance of the parts of this
system and are further specified by technical specifications for interoperability (“TSI”). The TSIs are
drafted for both the high speed as well as the conventional railway system.

Directive 2016/797 provides for the drafting and revision of the TSIs. It has been supplemented by
the EU Commission Delegated Decision (EU) No 2017/1474 of June 8, 2017 defining more specifically
the objectives of each TSI in order to improve interoperability and facilitate the development and
improvement of rail services with third countries. Moreover, on April 4, 2018, the EU Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/545 (last amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/781 of
June 12, 2020) establishing practical arrangements for the railway vehicle authorization and railway
vehicle type authorization process pursuant to Directive (EU) No 2016/797 has been adopted. With
respect to the Fourth Railway Package, implementing regulations are issued to make sure that
national legislation is consistent across all EU member states. This regulation governs the
authorization of railway vehicles throughout Europe and aims to further speed up, simplify and
reduce the cost of the approval procedure for rolling stock.

Directive (EU) No 2016/798 (last amended by Regulation (EU) No 2020/1530 of the EU Parliament
and of the EU Council of October 21, 2020) provides for the drafting and revision of common safety
methods (“CSMs”), common safety targets and common safety indicators. Inter alia, since February
2018, the EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/761 (last amended by Commission
Regulation (EU) 2020/782 of June 12, 2020), which is based on Directive (EU) 2016/798, establishes
CSMs for supervision by national safety authorities following the issue of a uniform safety certificate
or a safety authorization for conformity assessment and surveillance. The CSMs shall be regularly
revised in order to maintain and continuously improve safety, taking into account the general
development of railway safety.

EU member states had to transpose Directive 2008/57/EC by July 19, 2010. Its proper
implementation remained obligatory under the Fourth Railway Package. They had time until
June 16, 2019 to transpose the interoperability and safety directives into national law. With respect
to Germany, an infringement proceeding had been opened in February 2016 after Germany had
failed to implement Directive 2008/57/EC. On August 11, 2018, the German Railway Commissioning
Approval Regulation (Eisenbahn-Inbetriebnahmegenehmigungsverordnung) entered into force
transposing EU law on rail interoperability. However, since Directive 2008/57/EC had been repealed
by Directive (EU) 2016/797 with effect from June 16, 2020, member states also have to transpose the
new Directive into national law. In Germany, the Directive has been implemented by regulations
implementing the 4th railway package of the European Union of March 16, 2020, e.g. by way of
amendments to the German Railway Act (Allgemeines Eisenbahngesetz) and the German Federal
Railway Traffic Administration Act (Bundeseisenbahnverkehrsverwaltungsgesetz). However, on May
14, 2020, the EU Commission requested that Germany make further amendments, and, in particular,
referred to the German provisions concerning the requirements for braking systems of freight
wagons not being in line with EU law and, thus, hampering efforts towards interoperability. On
January 26, 2023, the Commission sent letters of formal notice to Germany to implement correctly
the rail interoperability and safety rules of Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798. This
procedure is still pending.

As regards the high-speed railway system, TSI for the rolling stock subsystem were adopted on
May 30, 2002 (EU Commission Decision No 2002/735/EC), and revised by EU Commission Decision No
2008/232/EC of February 21, 2008, which has been repealed by EU Commission Regulation (EU) No


-----

1302/2014 of November 18, 2014, last amended by the EU Commission Implementing Regulation
(EU) 2020/387 of March 9, 2020.

Concerning the conventional railway system, TSI relating to locomotives and passenger rolling stock
were adopted by EU Commission Decision No 2011/291/EU on April 26, 2011, as amended by
Commission Decision 2012/464/EU of July 23, 2012 which has been, too, repealed by EU Commission
Regulation (EU) No 1302/2014 of November 18, 2014. In addition, TSI on freight wagons have been
established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 321/2013 of March 13, 2013, last amended by EU
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/387 of March 9, 2020. TSI concerning noise have
been issued by EU Commission Decision 2011/229/EU of April 4, 2011 which has been repealed by EU
Commission Regulation (EU) No 1304/2014 of November 26, 2014, last amended by EU Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/774 of May 16, 2019.

Applicable technical standards for the TSI are published by the European Railways Agency on a
regular basis.

Directive 2004/49/EC on Safety of the Community’s railways was amended by EU Commission
Directive 2014/88/EU of July 9, 2014 in respect of common safety indicators and common methods
of calculating accident costs. Furthermore, Directive 2004/49/EC was subject to a recast by the
Directive (EU) 2016/798 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of May 11, 2016, last amended
by Directive (EU) 2020/1530 of the EU Parliament and of the EU Council of October 21, 2020. The
intent of this recast was to improve the railway safety and oblige manufacturers of products for
railway vehicles to carry out risk control measures and to report known risks to other actors of the
rail system.

**_Regulations on Medical Devices_**

We manufacture accessories for medical devices (e.g., bearing support systems for computer
tomography) and are therefore obliged to comply with several requirements of the European
Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (last amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/561 of the EU
Parliament and of the EU Council of April 23, 2020) (the “Medical Device Regulation”), which has
been applicable since May 26, 2021. The Medical Device Regulation repealed EU Council Directive
93/42/EEC to ensure that only one set of rules applies to the placing of medical devices on the
market and the related aspects covered by this Regulation. It aims to enhance patient safety and
modernize public health by introducing an enhanced governance framework around the definition,
supervision, traceability and risk-based classification system for medical device equipment.

Moreover, in 2017, the EU Commission issued the EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)
2017/2185 of November 23, 2017 on the list of codes and corresponding types of devices for the
purpose of specifying the scope of the designation as notified bodies in the field of medical devices.

### Regulatory Framework for our Products in the United States

There are numerous regulations that govern the automotive, aviation and railway sectors in the
United States. Vehicles, aircraft, rail cars and their components have to comply with numerous
standards that were enacted for safety and environmental reasons. Many of our products must
conform to these standards and regulations. Changes in regulations and standards could result in
increased costs for our business.

Federal, state, and municipal governments all enforce a variety of regulations addressing
environmental, health, and safety concerns. At the federal level, those laws include (but are not
limited to): the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which regulates air emissions from mobile and stationary
sources; the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges with the potential to impact certain bodies
of water; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
which provides that owners and operators of contaminated sites face joint and several liability


-----

regardless of fault for investigating and remediating such sites; and the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, which governs the cradle-to-grave management and disposal of a variety of solid and
hazardous substances. There are a wide variety of additional federal laws which impose obligations
on manufacturers to reduce pollution in the environment. Moreover, US states and many US
municipalities have analogous laws regulating these same sectors that apply to our operations in the
United States.

**_Vehicle emissions and fuel economy_**

The CAA grants the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) the authority to impose and
enforce air quality standards, including vehicle emissions requirements for passenger vehicles, lightduty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles.

In March 2014, the EPA finalized the Tier 3 Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards Program which
regulates vehicle emission and evaporative standards for passenger vehicles, light-duty trucks, and
certain heavy-duty vehicles, and sets standards for the release of volatile organic compounds, carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matters, as well as standards governing a vehicle’s
guaranteed useful life and other matters.

Under the Federal Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, automobile manufacturers are
required to comply with the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards, which are
enforced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), and apply to passenger
vehicles and light-duty trucks. The CAFE regulations were enacted in 1975 and were first used to set
fuel economy standards in 1978. The CAFE fuel economy standards, which take into account
technological feasibility, economic practicality, the effect of other standards on fuel economy and the
need of the nation to conserve energy, are set years in advance of production to allow manufacturers
time to comply with the standards. The standards apply to the average of a manufacturer’s fleet of
vehicles, rather than to each individual vehicle.

Fuel economy standards were dramatically impacted by the Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007, which amended the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Energy Independence and
Security Act initially set a goal for national fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon for both cars and light
trucks by 2020, and NHTSA has had to periodically raise CAFE standards to meet this goal.

In October 2016, EPA and NHTSA finalized CAFE and greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) standards for
medium- and heavy-duty trucks from 2018 through model year 2027, which vary by the type and
weight of the vehicle.

In April 2020, EPA and NHTSA issued the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles Rule (the “SAFE
**Rule”), a two-part regulation. Part One broadly allowed NHTSA to preempt state and local laws**
related to fuel economy standards. In particular, Part One revoked a federal waiver, issued by the
EPA in 2013, authorizing the California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) to adopt and enforce stricter
emissions standards than those required under federal law. The SAFE Rule also challenged
California’s Low Emission Vehicle (“LEV III”) program, which sets standards for guaranteed useful life
and evaporative emissions, and reduces emissions of smog pollutants (including carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides, and particular matter) and GHGs for passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks for
model years 2015 to 2025. A number of states have adopted regulations substantially similar to
California’s ZEV and LEV III programs.

Part Two of the regulation amended CAFE and GHG emissions standards for passenger vehicles and
light-duty trucks for model years 2021 through 2026, and set a new, less stringent fuel economy
target of 40 miles per gallon by 2026. In December 2021, NHTSA repealed “Part One” of the SAFE
Rule, eliminating the preemption of state and local laws. NHTSA has also proposed a repeal of “Part
Two” of the SAFE Rule. If and when such repeal occurs, it may or may not be replaced by more
stringent fuel-economy standards. In December 2021, EPA issued its own rule establishing revised,


-----

more stringent national GHG emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years
2023 to 2026.

Recent regulatory developments also indicate future changes to standards applicable to the heavyduty truck and engine sector. In January 2020, EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule
(“ANPR”) requesting comments on new rules based on EPA’s 2018 Cleaner Trucks Initiative, which
would establish, among other things, new emission standards for nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and other
pollutants for heavy-duty engines. Pursuant to that initiative, in August 2021 EPA announced plans to
address GHG and other emissions from heavy-duty trucks through a series of rulemakings over the
next three years. The first proposed rule, announced March 7, 2022, sets standards to reduce NOx
emissions. EPA issued a related final rule in December 2022, effective March 27, 2023, that imposes
more stringent emissions standards covering a wider range of heavy-duty engine operating
conditions compared to previous standards. The final rule is a part of the comprehensive “Clean
Trucks Plan” and will apply to heavy-duty vehicles and engines starting with model year 2027. EPA is
expected to release proposals in 2023 for two remaining steps to the Clean Trucks Plan, including
proposals for a heavy-duty GHG standards “Phase 3” rule for model years 2027 and later, and a
multipollutant standards proposal for light and medium-duty vehicles for model years 2027 and later.
In August 2020, CARB also adopted a Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus Regulation requiring
manufacturers to comply with more stringent emissions standards. Specifically, the proposed HeavyDuty Low NOx Omnibus Regulation would revise exhaust emission standards, cutting NOx standards
to 75% below current standards beginning in 2024, and 90% below current standards in 2027, and
change testing programs and procedures. Other states have followed suit, as Oregon has also
approved the Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus Regulation, and several others have approved similar
rules requiring the production and sale of successively cleaner trucks over time.

**_Road Safety and Technical Standards_**

NHTSA issues Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) to which manufacturers of vehicle
equipment must conform. The first standard became effective on March 1, 1967, and NHTSA has
issued new standards and amended existing standards on a regular basis. Currently, up to 67 FMVSSs
must be considered in a self-certification process before a vehicle may be released into the U.S.
market.

The NHTSA regulations relate primarily to crash avoidance and crashworthiness and cover a wide
variety of automotive products and systems, including windshield wipers, brakes, hydraulic systems,
tires, mirrors, seat belts, head restraints and fuel systems. In general, the regulations are written in
terms of minimum safety performance requirements for motor vehicles or items of motor vehicle
equipment. These requirements are specified in such a manner that the public is protected against
unreasonable risk of crashes occurring as a result of the design, construction or performance of
motor vehicles and is also protected against unreasonable risk of death or injury in the event crashes
do occur.

In 2016, NHTSA secured a voluntary commitment from 20 automakers representing over 99% of U.S.
market share to equip future vehicles with automatic electronic braking systems (“AEBS”). AEBS will
become standard on almost all light-duty cars and trucks with a GVW of 8,500 pounds or less
beginning no later than September 1, 2022 and on almost all trucks with GVW between 8,501 pounds
and 10,000 pounds beginning no later than September 1, 2025. These requirements will impose
significant new costs on manufacturers.

NHTSA also responds to legislative mandates. In 2000, the U.S. Congress passed the Transportation
Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act (“TREAD Act”) that directed NHTSA to
adopt a new regulation requiring: (i) manufacturers who sell more than 500 vehicles annually in the
United States; (ii) manufacturers of child restraint systems; and (iii) tire manufacturers (“Group 1”) to
provide, among other reporting obligations, quarterly reports to NHTSA of death and injury claims


-----

and notices and the numbers of warranty claims, consumer complaints, property damage claims and
field reports received by those manufacturers about all motor vehicles and tires sold by them in the
ten years prior to the report. NHTSA requires manufacturers who sell less than 500 vehicles annually
in the United States as well as all vehicle equipment manufacturers other than of tires and child
restraint systems (“Group 2”), including us, to comply with more limited reporting obligations,
including a requirement (i) to report all fatal accidents occurring inside the United States where the
fatal consequences have been caused by the manufacturer’s vehicle parts or components and (ii) to
report all fatal accidents outside the United States where the fatal consequences have been caused
by the manufacturer’s vehicle parts or components and these vehicle parts or components, or vehicle
parts or components with equivalent technical content, have been marketed inside the United
States. These rules were adopted in 2002. With the recent passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law (Public Law 117-58), Section 30118 of 49 U.S. Code has been amended to include two new
reporting requirements. Quarterly completion reports are now required for eight consecutive
quarters instead of the previous requirement of six quarters. Also, annual completion reports are
now required for each of the three years beginning after the date of completion of the eighth
quarterly report.

The TREAD Act also required NHTSA to adopt new standards improving the safety performance of
passenger vehicle tires in several critical areas. As a result of this latter mandate, in 2003, NHTSA
issued a final rule to improve tire safety, concentrating particularly on tire endurance and speed
performance to reduce failure. The TREAD Act also required NHTSA to adopt new standards related
to tire pressure monitoring systems, which has been accomplished. All new light duty vehicles sold in
the United States must be equipped with tire pressure monitoring systems that comply with the new
NHTSA standard.

In 2018, the SELF DRIVE Act was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives to encourage testing
and implementation of “highly automated vehicles” (“HAVs”) and vehicles equipped with automated
driving systems (“ADS”), and a similar bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate. This proposed legislation
would have directed federal rulemaking requiring manufacturers introducing HAV or ADS-equipped
vehicles to provide the U.S. Department of Transportation with a safety evaluation report describing
manufacturer efforts to comply with vehicle safety requirements. While the SELF DRIVE Act did not
become law, it has been reintroduced into the current Congress as recently as September 2020, and
a majority of states have enacted autonomous vehicle legislation and/or adopted executive orders on
self-driving vehicles.

In 2018, NHTSA updated guidelines for the testing and deployment of ADS, providing additional
clarity and alignment with OEM requests, including the announcement of a possible pilot program to
encourage public road testing of vehicles equipped with ADS.

In December 2016, NHTSA published FMVSS No. 141, which requires hybrid and electric vehicles to
meet minimum sound standards to make pedestrians more aware of approaching vehicles. Among
NHTSA’s other stated vehicle safety objectives for the near future from its June 2015 Priority Plan for
Vehicle Safety and Fuel Economy are research and potential rule-making on advanced technologies
for fuel economy, collision avoidance, automatic braking, vehicle communications, lane departure
prevention, blind spot and pedestrian detection, as well as additional occupant protection measures.

There are also U.S. state laws dealing with product safety and liability that apply to vehicles and
vehicle parts. The exact standards can differ across state jurisdictions.

Finally, in recent years NHTSA has approached the issue of cybersecurity with respect to over-the-air
software updates (“OTAs”) with increased scrutiny. Though there are currently no regulations in
place controlling their use or imposing vehicle standards, NHTSA has published guidance related to
best practices in automotive cybersecurity, and recently criticized one manufacturer for failing to
notify NHTSA of a safety issue when it issued an OTA to rectify a design flaw. Thus it is possible
NHTSA will consider imposing restrictions or rules on OTA cybersecurity in the near future.

**_Aviation Equipment Standards_**

The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) issues and enforces regulations and minimum standards
covering manufacturing, operating and maintaining aircraft. Among other key roles with respect to
regulating civil, commercial and military aviation, the FAA is charged with ensuring the safety and
environmental acceptability of U.S.-registered civil aircraft operating in air commerce as well as
airworthiness certification or acceptance of civil aeronautical products imported into the United
States.

The FAA prescribes and periodically revises minimum standards of safety for appliances and for the
design, material, construction, quality of work, and performance of aircraft, aircraft engines and
propellers.

We currently maintain Air Agency Certificates issued by the FAA for operation of approved repair
stations, pursuant to Part 145 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”), a Parts
Manufacturer Approval issued by the FAA pursuant to Part 21.303 of Title 14 of the CFR, and a
Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement between the United States and the European Community on
Cooperation in the Regulation of Civil Aviation Safety.

### Regulatory Framework for our Products in China 

**_Product Safety and Liability_**

_General Rules on Product Safety and Liability_

We have to comply with requirements on product safety stipulated in the Product Quality Law of
China and Law of Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests, promulgated by the Standing
Committee of the National People’s Congress of China on July 8, 2000 (latest amended on December
29, 2018) and October 25, 2013, respectively, and the Civil Code of China promulgated by the
National People’s Congress of China on May 28, 2020, respectively.

Under the said laws, the quality of a product shall: (i) be free from unreasonable dangers to the
personal or property safety, and conform to the national or sector standards for safeguarding the
health and personal or property safety if such standards are available; (ii) possess the properties and
functions for use that they ought to possess, except for those with directions stating the defects in
the functions of the product; and (iii) conform to the product standards marked on the product or on
the package thereof, and to the quality conditions indicated by way of product directions and
physical sample.

If the defect of a product causes personal injury or damage to another’s property, then the victim
may hold either the seller or the producer liable for such damage, although the party that pays a
claim for liability may ultimately seek indemnification from the other party, depending on who is
found to be at fault. In addition, any producer or seller of products not up to the relevant standards
for ensuring human health, personal safety and safety of property will be subject to fines of a
maximum amount of three times the value of the products illegally produced and other punitive
measures.

_Recall of Defective Automobile Products_

The State Council of China released the Administrative Regulations for Recalls of Defective
Automobile Products (the “Chinese **Recall Regulation”) on October 22, 2012, (amended on March 2,**
2019) which requires us to recall any defective products as defined by the administrative rules and
regulations. The Chinese Recall Regulation covers the initiation, implementation and reporting
procedures for recalls of the defective product. On January 17, 2013, the State Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (the “AQSIQ”), a predecessor of the State


-----

Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”), issued the Opinions on General Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine Regarding Several Issues Concerning Implementation
of Chinese Recall Regulations (the “AQSIQ Opinion”). The AQSIQ Opinion elaborates that the defects
that subject the products to recall procedure are those resulting from design, manufacturing, labeling
or other reasons, common to the same batch, model or type of automobiles, and posing risks to
personal or property safety.

As soon as a defect is confirmed, the producer of the product in question must cease production,
distribution, sale and/or import and export of the defective products and must recall those that are
in the market. If a producer fails to do so, the product quality control administration of the State
Council of China has the power to order the producer who fails to comply with the recall procedure
to carry out the recall. Upon receiving such order, the producer must take immediate measures
including correction or supplementation of marks, repair, replacement, or return of products towards
eliminating all defects. The producer must also bear all expenses incurred in eliminating the defects
and in shipping/delivering the defective products. If a producer of defective products remains not to
comply with the Chinese Recall Regulations, the producer is subject to administrative fines of a
maximum amount of Chinese renminbi 1 million or 10% of the total value of defective products. In
addition, the Producer may face punitive administrative actions including forfeiture of illegal
proceeds (if any) and revoking its regulatory permits and business licenses.

AQSIQ promulgated the Measures for Implementing the Chinese Recall Regulations (the “Chinese
**Implementing Measures”) on November 27, 2015 (amended on October 23, 2020), which imposes**
explicit responsibilities on the producers of automotive parts and components, including notifying
China authorities and relevant car makers in case of potential safety defects on products. In the
event of any administrative investigation against defective products, SAMR has the power to enter
the premises of any automotive parts and components producers, automobile producers and
operators, to conduct onsite searches, to review and duplicate relevant materials and records, and to
question any entity or individual about possible defects of automobiles. Automotive parts and
component producers who do not cooperate in these procedures are subject to administrative fines
of a maximum amount of Chinese renminbi 30,000.

In addition, if the administrative authority suspects that a perpetrator who violates the Chinese
Recall Regulation or the Chinese Implementing Measures may have committed crime, the authority
may report the case to criminal prosecution in accordance with the criminal law.

On July 1, 2021, the GB/T 39603-2020 was introduced based on the rules given in GB/T 1.1-2009. This
standard was proposed and governed by the National Standardization Technical Committee for
Product Defects and Safety Management (SAC/TC 463) and describes the guidelines for the recall
effectiveness evaluation of defective motor vehicle products.

SAMR promulgated the Notice on Further Strengthening Supervision of Automobile Remote Upgrade
(OTA) Technology Recall (the “OTA Recall Notice”) on November 23, 2020 (supplemented on June 4,
2021). Under the OTA Recall Notice, if an auto parts or components manufacturer is aware of any
automobile producer who uses OTA to conceal vehicle defects and to avoid its recall responsibilities,
the auto parts or components manufacturer may directly report to SAMR.

SAMR and the Ministry of Ecological Environment promulgated the Administrative Provisions on
Emissions-related Recalls of Motor Vehicles (the “Provisions”) on April 27, 2021. Under the
Provisions, if there is prevailing non-compliance with the national standards for the emission of air
pollutants in the same batch, model or category of motor vehicles due to defects in design or
production or non-compliance with specific requirements for durability in environmental protection,
the manufacturer shall recall the vehicle, and a failure to do so will be subject to a fine of no more
than Chinese renminbi 30,000.


-----

_Chinese Three Guarantees of Automobiles and Related Parts_

On July 22, 2021, SAMR promulgated the Regulations on Liability for Repair, Replacement and Return
of Household Automotive Products (the “China Household Automobile Guarantee Regulations”).

Under the China Household Automobile Guarantee Regulations, consumers are entitled to request
for repair, replacement and return (“Chinese Three Guarantees”) of automobiles and their related
parts within certain periods. The sellers of automobiles must assume liability for the Chinese Three
Guarantees. If the liability is attributable to the producer or other business operators, the sellers are
entitled to reimbursement by the latter.

If within the earlier of (i) 60 days after the sale and delivery (whichever is later) of an automobile or
(ii) 3,000 kilometer of traveled mileage of an automobile, it is determined that a major part of the
engine, gearbox, power storage battery or driving motor has quality problems, then the consumer
may choose to replace the engine, gearbox, power storage battery or driving motor for free based on
the Three-Guarantees certificate. In the event that the consumable spare parts of the household
vehicle products are found to have defects within the quality assurance period, the interested
consumers may choose to replace such spare parts for free. Categories of the consumable spare
parts and their quality assurance periods shall be explicitly indicated by the manufacturer in a
Chinese Three Guarantees certificate.

Any party who breaches the China Household Automobile Guarantee Regulations could be subject to
fines of a maximum amount of Chinese renminbi 30,000.

_Remanufacturing of Automobile Parts_

On April 14, 2021, National Development and Reform Commission and other ministries of China
promulgated Interim Measures for Standardized Administration of the Remanufacturing of
Automobile Parts and Components (the “Measures for Remanufacturing”) to promote sustainable
economy. “Remanufacturing” as mentioned in Measures for Remanufacturing refers to the process
of professionally repairing or upgrading the used automobile parts and components that are no
longer used due to functional damage or technical obsolescence to make their quality characteristic,
safety and environmental performance not lower than that of new prototype products.
Remanufacturing enterprises are the subjects responsible for quality of remanufactured products
and shall formulate perfect rules and regulations on remanufacturing quality control and quality
inspection. For the remanufactured products, the quality shall meet the quality standards for new
original products, the safety standards shall not be lower than national requirements for new original
products of motor vehicle components and parts, and the environmental protection performance
shall meet the requirements of relevant national standards.

**_Technical Standards_**

_Compulsory Product Certification and Vehicle Conformity Certification_

According to Provisions on the Administration of Compulsory Product Certification (the “Chinese
**Provisions”) promulgated by the AQSIQ on July 3, 2009 and amended by SAMR on September 29,**
2022, products listed in the official catalog, to be updated from time to time, must pass the
certification process and be affixed with a China Compulsory Certificate (the “CCC”) before delivered
from factories, marketed, imported or used in any commercial activities.

Products with CCC must comply with recall rules as required under the Chinese Provisions where any
producer or seller of a CCC product discovers any potential safety danger in the product produced or
sold, which poses harm to human health or safety.

On August 21, 2014, the Certification and Accreditation Administration (the “Chinese CAA”)
promulgated the Implementation Rules of Compulsory Product Certification (automobile) (amended


-----

and restated on April 16, 2020), under which producers must provide Vehicle Conformity Certificates
for each automobile to prove that it has passed the certification process. On December 16, 2014, the
Chinese CAA promulgated the Catalogue Description and Definition for Compulsory Product
Certification (amended and restated on April 21, 2020), under which automobile as a whole and
several types of automotive components are listed and are therefore required to pass the
certification process to receive a CCC.

A further standard was proposed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the
People’s Republic of China for introduction in 2022 and concerns the technical requirements for the
cyber security of remote maintenance and management systems for electric vehicles. Among other
requirements, this standard requires an on-board unit installed in a vehicle to collect and store
important status parameters of the vehicle and system parts and send them to the platform defined
in GB/T32960.1-2016.

_Cyber Security_

On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China
promulgated the Cyber Security Law (“CSL”). Under the CSL, (i) cyber operators must not collect or
use personal information unless such collection or use are lawful, reasonable and necessary; (ii) cyber
operators must disclose its rules of collection and use of personal information, and the purpose, type
and scope of collection and use of personal information; (iii) cyber operators must obtain the
individual’s consent before the collection and use of such individual’s personal information; (iv) cyber
operators must not collect personal information which has no relation to the service provided by
such cyber operator; (v) cyber operators must not disclose any individual’s personal information to
any third party without such individual’s prior consent.

_Data Security_

On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated
the Data Security Law (“DSL”). Under the DSL, a data processor (i) has the duty to ensure data
security, (ii) must carry out a risk assessment and file a risk report when processing important data,
and (iii) must not collect information unless through a legitimate and reasonable way.

_Automotive Data Security Management_

On August 16, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”) and other ministries
promulgated the Provisions on Automotive Data Security Management (for Trial Implementation)
(the “ADSM Provisions”), which requires entities (including auto parts and software suppliers) that
carry out automotive data processing businesses (the “Automotive Data Processors”) to comply with
certain rules during the processing of automotive data. Under the ADSM Provisions, (i) processing of
automotive data by Automotive Data Processors must be carried out in a lawful, reasonable, specific
and clear way, and in a way directly related to the design, production, sale, use, operation and
maintenance of automobiles; (ii) the Automotive Data Processor must inform, in a manifest way, the
individual of the matters that require the processing of such individual’s personal information
(including but not limited to the type of the processed information, the information selection method
and the purpose of the processing) in advance; (iii) before processing any personal information, the
Automotive Data Processor must obtain consent of the individual; (iv) processing of any sensitive
personal information (including but not limited to videos, pictures, tracks and biometrics) must
comply with stricter rules; (v) the Automotive Data Processor must conduct a risk assessment and file
a risk assessment report when processing important data that may endanger national security, public
interests or personal legitimate interests (the “Important Data”); (vi) Important Data must be stored
within the territory of China and must not be provided overseas before passing a mandatory security
assessment organized by CAC; and (vii) if the Automotive Data Processor processes any Important
Data, it must report on the status of its security management of the automotive data to the relevant
authority before December 15th on an annual basis.


-----

Violation of the CSL, DSL or ADSM Provisions will subject the perpetrator processor to fines of a
maximum amount of ten times the value of the unlawful gains or Chinese renminbi 1,000,000 (if no
unlawful gains), and the key personnel will be subject to fines of a maximum amount of Chinese
renminbi 100,000. In the event of serious violation, the perpetrator processor will be subject to
suspension of business or cancellation of business license.

**_Environment Protection_**

_Combustion Fuel Consumption Rate Evaluation and Measuring Method_

Under the Law of Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution, promulgated by Standing
Committee of the National People’s Congress of China on August 29, 2015 (amended on October
26, 2018), no vehicles shall be permitted to discharge atmospheric pollutants in excess of the
prescribed discharge standards. No business entity or individual may manufacture, sell or import
vehicles that discharge pollutants in excess of the prescribed standards. China’s Ministry of Ecology
and Environment (the “Chinese MEE”) has the authority to apply automobile fuel economy level
certificate to automobiles which satisfy different national fuel economy standards. Accordingly,
China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, the predecessor of Chinese MEE promulgated national
fuel economy standards including Limits and Measurement Methods of Light Vehicle Emission (China
Stage VI) (GB18352.6-2016), Limits and Measurement Methods of Light Vehicle Emission (China Stage
V) (GB18352.5-2013), Limits and Measurement Methods of Light Vehicle Emission (China Stage III/IV)
(GB18352.3-2005), Limits and Measurement Methods of Engine (Automotive Compression Ignition
Style and Fuel Gas Spark Ignition Style), Automobile Pollutant Emission (China Stage III/IV/V)
(GB17691-2005). Under the standard Limits and Measurement Methods of Light Vehicle Emission
(China Stage VI) (GB18352.6-2016), a valid and applicable standard in China, (i) all light-duty vehicles
sold and registered for road operation from July 1, 2020 must comply with the requirements of
(GB18352.6-2016), and the type I test must comply with the requirements of stage 6a limits; (ii) all
light-duty vehicles sold and registered for road operation from July 1, 2023, must comply with the
requirements of (GB18352.6-2016), and the type I test must comply with the requirements of stage
6b limits, which are stricter than those of the 6a limits.

Automobile OEMs and importers are required to disclose to the public (including but not limited to
uploading information to a website of Chinese MEE) the environmental information regarding the
relevant vehicles manufactured or imported by them, such as emission testing information and
pollution control technical information.

**_Industry Development Planning for “Green Vehicles”_**

In recent years, the development of “green vehicles” (i.e., energy-efficient and new-energy vehicles)
is strongly promoted in China. According to the Industry Development Planning for Energy-efficient
and New-energy Vehicle (2021-2035) (Guo Fa 2020 No.39), promulgated by the State Council of
China on October 20, 2020, the government promotes the high-quality development of new energy
automobile industry and accelerates the development of China into a powerful automobile country.

_New-energy Vehicles_

Under the Provisions for the Administration of Entry of New-energy vehicle Manufacturers and Their
Products, promulgated by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (the “Chinese
**MIIT”) on January 6, 2017 (amended and restated on July 24, 2020), “new-energy vehicle” means**
vehicles using new types of power systems, entirely or mainly relying on new-energy as their driving
force, including plug-in hybrid (including extended-range) vehicles, pure electric vehicles, and fuel cell
vehicles.

According to Guiding Opinions of the General Office of the State Council of China on Accelerating the
Popularization and Application of Alternative Fuel Vehicles promulgated by General Office of the


-----

State Council of China on July 14, 2014, the government will establish policy regimes including
government subsidies, preferential tax treatment etc. to support and promote the development of
alternative fuel vehicles.

_Corporate Average Fuel Consumption (the “CAFC”) credits (the “CAFC Credits”) and New-energy_
_Vehicles credits (the “NEV Credits”)_

In order to further promote the development of energy-efficient and new-energy vehicles, the
Chinese MIIT promulgated the Parallel Management Method of Corporate Average Fuel
Consumption and New-energy Vehicles Credits of Passenger Car Enterprises on September 27, 2017,
and the Decision of Revising Chinese CAFC and NEV Credit Management Method on June 15, 2020
(collectively, the “CAFC and NEV Credit Requirements”), which set out the requirements of CAFC
Credits and NEV Credits for passenger car enterprises.

According to the CAFC and NEV Credit Requirements, the required target CAFC Credits of a passenger
car enterprise refers to the target value of the CAFC and the CAFC requirement of the enterprise in
an accounting year in question.

The target value of the CAFC and the relevant value of CAFC requirements are set out in Fuel
Consumption Evaluation Methods and Targets for Passenger Cars (GB 27999–2019), promulgated by
SAMR and effective from January 1, 2021. The required target NEV Credits of a passenger car
enterprise refers to the production or importation volume of traditional energy passenger vehicles
and the proportion requirements of new-energy vehicles of the enterprise in an accounting year. For
passenger car enterprises whose annual production or importation volume of traditional energy
passenger vehicles is more than 30,000 vehicles, the proportion requirement of NEV Credits for 2019,
2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 is 10%, 12%, 14%, 16% and 18%, respectively.

Any passenger car enterprise that does not comply with the Chinese CAFC and NEV Credit
Requirements may not be listed in Announcement of Road Motor Vehicle Manufacturers and
Products (published by Chinese MIIT) or obtain CCCs and may be subject to penalties.

### Export Control Regulations and Economic Sanctions 

We manufacture products (e.g., bearings and power transmission) which may be subject to
restrictions under EU, U.S. and other applicable export control regulations. In addition, applicable
economic sanctions regulations may generally restrict us from engaging in business in or with
designated countries, entities or individuals.

In terms of export controls, we manufacture, to a limited extent, products subject to dual-use
controls (e.g., EU Dual-Use, U.S. Export Administration Regulations). Regulation (EU) 2021/821 of
May 21, 2021 (the “Dual Use Regulation”) entered into force on September 9, 2021 and repealed
Council Regulation (EU) 428/2009 of May 5, 2009 (last amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/821 of June
8, 2021). The Dual Use Regulation sets forth an EU-wide regime for the control of exports and
transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. Annex I of this Regulation includes a comprehensive
list of dual-use goods which contain, for example, specific bearings and production machines. The
export of such items to destinations outside the EU requires a license. The competent national
authority may exercise a certain degree of discretion as regards the granting of such license.

In addition, some of our products are destined for military applications subject to national military
goods controls (e.g., Munitions List of the Export List of the German Foreign Trade and Payments
Ordinance (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung), United States Munitions List of the International Traffic in
Arms (ITAR) regulations). We therefore have to observe the applicable export control regulations of
the relevant country of development and manufacturing and the relevant country of dispatch. Such
deliveries also require licenses for exports to destinations within and outside the EU. Applicable


-----

export control regulations may limit or prohibit the export of such products if specific countries,
entities, individuals or end-users are the destination of such shipments or other transfers.

Furthermore, export control regulations and economic sanctions of specific countries may have an
impact on our customer or supplier relationships even if these relationships do not relate directly to
such countries. These regulations and economic sanctions may apply to any of our products that are
exported, re-exported or made available in a country where such regulations apply, or to our
operations in countries where such economic sanctions are applicable.

We have an Export Compliance Management system with procedures, systems and other measures
(e.g. an automated IT-based monitoring system) in place to ensure compliance with applicable export
control laws and regulations and economic sanctions. Relevant transactions are generally reviewed
and authorized or denied, as the case may be, in line with applicable regulations. If required,
necessary licenses are obtained before conducting such transactions.

Due to the Cuban Asset Control Regulations (CACR) and a change in the Iran Transaction Sanction
Regulation (ITSR) in 2012, we are subject to the prohibitions of so-called primary economic sanctions
pursuant to the CACR and the ITSR as a result our ownership structure. In 2015, we discovered that
some of our subsidiaries had made some limited sales into Iran and some of our distributors may
have supplied Schaeffler products to Cuba, which may not have been in full compliance with
sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(“OFAC”). Upon discovery of these potential violations, we undertook remedial actions to help
ensure compliance with applicable sanctions laws, including discontinuing all sales into Iran, and
voluntarily reported these incidents to OFAC. OFAC closed the matter with no enforcement actions
by issuing a Cautionary Letter only. Following the lifting of a number of economic sanctions and
export controls targeting Iran in January 2016, we recommenced limited sales into Iran in compliance
with applicable economic sanctions programs (e.g. General License H), taking into account the U.S.
ownership of the Schaeffler Group. As of November 5, 2018, a broad range of U.S. economic
sanctions and export controls targeting Iran have been re-imposed by the United States. Thus, we
discontinued our activities in Iran again as of November 5, 2018. In 2019, shortly after we completed
an acquisition, we discovered that the acquired entity may not have been in full compliance with
certain Iran-related sanctions administered by OFAC. Upon discovery of these potential violations, we
undertook remedial actions to help ensure compliance with applicable sanctions laws and voluntarily
reported these incidents to OFAC. OFAC closed the matter with no enforcement actions by issuing a
Cautionary Letter only. See “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—Our compliance
_management system may fail to prevent or detect corruption, fraud, money laundering, other_
_criminal or unauthorized behavior or violations of trade and economic sanctions rules.”_

In 2022 and 2023, in response to the war in Ukraine the EU, the U.S. and the UK, among others, have
adopted a series of economic sanctions and export controls, which restrict, in particular, a wide range
of trade and financial dealings with Russia and certain Russian persons, some of which have been
extended to Belarus, and could be extended to additional countries and persons. In addition, Russia
has adopted countermeasures and countersanctions and could adopt additional countermeasures, as
could other countries such as Belarus. We generated (i) 0.9%, 0.9% and 0.2% of our revenues in
Russia in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, (ii) 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.01% of our revenues in Belarus in
2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and (iii) 0.2%, 0.2% and 0.1% of our revenues in Ukraine in 2020,
2021 and 2022, respectively. We reduced production at our plant in Ulyanovsk, Russia (98 employees
in Russia) to the minimum possible in order to continue to meet our contractual delivery obligations,
and ceased the operations of our Automotive Aftermarket and Industrial Divisions in Russia. We had
also sourced certain raw materials, such as steel, from sources in Russia, which we discontinued after
the outbreak of the war, and had utilized shipping routes between Europe and China that crossed
through Russia, which we have re-routed. In addition, we entered into an agreement for the sale of
our two Russian subsidiaries, which is subject to approval by the Russian authorities. In Ukraine,
though our sales office in Kyiv (six employees in Ukraine) was initially closed, our operations in


-----

Ukraine have resumed. These economic sanctions and export controls (including the
countermeasures and countersanctions) are rapidly evolving and increasingly severe. We have
procedures, systems, and other measures in place to ensure compliance and we are monitoring the
developments closely, with particular attention to additional economic sanctions. If we identify a
business partner is subject to sanctions prohibitions, we will stop any restricted activities
immediately. See “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—Our compliance management
_system may fail to prevent or detect corruption, fraud, money laundering, other criminal or_
_unauthorized behavior or violations of trade and economic sanctions rules.”_

### Laws on State Aid 

Within the EU, state aid may be granted by the EU, the EU member states or through state resources
in various forms, including subsidies, loans or guarantees at favorable conditions, or infrastructure
measures realized specifically for one company. Pursuant to Article 107 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”), aid granted by a member state or aid granted through state
resources, in any form whatsoever, that distorts or threatens to distort competition by favoring
certain businesses or manufacturing sectors, is incompatible with the internal market of the EU
insofar as it affects trade between member states save as otherwise provided in the TFEU.

The EU Commission verifies on an ongoing basis whether EU member states are in compliance with
the existing rules on state aid (e.g., on the basis of notifications required by Article 108 of the TFEU
prior to granting state aid). If the EU Commission classifies a state aid scheme or single state aid
measure as prohibited aid, it may order that various measures be taken by the EU member state
concerned. In particular, the EU Commission could require the aid to be clawed back. In this case, the
aid beneficiary will be obliged to return or refund any payments received to the institution that
granted the aid. If the prohibited aid was granted under ongoing contracts, the beneficiary will have
to repay the subsidy equivalent (i.e., the difference between the fair market price of the performance
and the aid granted) or, in certain circumstances, the respective contracts will have to be rescinded.
Rescission could entail the premature termination of important contracts. Depending on the law of
the relevant EU member state (e.g., Germany), if the EU Commission has not been notified in
advance regarding a contract that entails state aid, such contract may be considered, in a worst case
scenario, null and void.

A part of our investment requirements for developing and expanding our production capacity is
covered by state aid, such as subsidies, loans at favorable conditions or tax reductions or exemptions.
The respective decisions on granting public aid received by us contain various ancillary provisions,
_e.g., regarding the creation of jobs or specific R&D activities. Concerning R&D activities, the EU_
Commission has published a Communication (Communication from the EU Commission, OJ 2014 C
198/1, June 27, 2014), generally lowering barriers for the public support of such activities. In case of a
breach of the ancillary provisions set out in the decision of the institution granting the state aid, the
aid may be clawed back by the institution that granted the aid.

## Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 

### Transactions of the Issuer

**_Upstream Loans_**

In September 2016, the Issuer on-lent part of the net proceeds from the issuance of debt securities
(including certain of the Existing Issuer Notes) to IHO Beteiligung under a notes proceeds loan in the
amount of €880 million (as amended from time to time, the “Notes Proceeds Loan”). In March 2020,
the Issuer set-off the obligations of IHO Beteiligung under the Notes Proceeds Loan against a
dividend-in-kind declared by the Issuer for that purpose.

**_Subordinated Shareholder Loan_**

On July 13, 2021, IHO Beteiligung granted a subordinated shareholder loan in the principal amount of
€550 million to the Issuer. The loan matures in May 2030 and accrues interest at a rate of 1% per
annum. At the Issuer’s sole discretion, interest is either payable in cash or capitalized (by increasing
the principal amount of the loan) during the term of the loan. In 2022, the Issuer paid €5 million in
cash interest on the subordinated shareholder loan. As of December 31, 2022, €3 million in interest
had accrued on the subordinated shareholder loan and the Issuer currently expects to pay the
accrued interest in cash on the next interest payment date in May 2023.

**_Atesteo Loan_**

Pursuant to a loan agreement dated February 14, 2018, between the Issuer and Atesteo, the Issuer
has granted the right to Atesteo GmbH & Co. KG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IHO Holding GmbH &
Co. KG, an indirect shareholder of the Issuer (formerly, Atesteo GmbH, “Atesteo”), a subsidiary of
IHO Holding GmbH & Co. KG, an indirect shareholder of the Issuer, to make drawings on behalf and
for the account of the Issuer of up to €50 million under ancillary facilities to the Issuer’s Revolving
Facility consisting of one or more credit facilities of up to €45 million and, in addition, a surety for a
certain €5 million bilateral credit facility (the “Atesteo Loan”). While the Issuer remains the primary
obligor under such ancillary facilities in respect of any such drawings made by Atesteo, Atesteo
operates the ancillary facilities on behalf and for the account of the Issuer. Under the terms of the
Atesteo Loan, Atesteo is required to reimburse the Issuer for any principal, interest and other
payments (including any commitment fee) to be made by the Issuer to the relevant lender under
such ancillary facilities. As of December 31, 2022, no drawings were made under such ancillary
facilities by Atesteo on behalf of and for the account of the Issuer.

On February 21, 2023, the Issuer entered into a loan and deposit master agreement with Atesteo
North America Inc. (“Atesteo N.A.”), a subsidiary of IHO Beteiligungs GmbH, under which the Issuer
may from time to time grant loans to Atesteo N.A. or Atesteo N.A. may from time to time make
deposits with the Issuer for terms of up to five years, with the specific terms of each loan or deposit
to be agreed on a case-by-case basis. Interest on loans and deposits will be calculated on the basis of
an applicable reference rate, plus (or, in the case of deposits made by Atesteo N.A., minus) a certain
margin. No loans or deposits have been made under the master agreement prior to the date of this
Offering Memorandum.

**_Intercompany Service Agreement_**

In December 2014, the Issuer entered into an intercompany service agreement, as amended from
time to time, with IHO Holding GmbH & Co. KG (previously named Schaeffler Holding GmbH & Co.
KG) pursuant to which IHO Holding GmbH & Co. KG provides certain accounting, tax and reporting
services to the Issuer. Pursuant to this agreement, the Issuer paid fees of €0.3 million in 2020, €0.5
million in 2021 and €0.5 million in 2022.


-----

**_Voting Rights and Share Pooling Agreement_**

On August 26, 2021, the Issuer and IHO Beteiligung entered into a voting rights and share pooling
agreement (the “Issuer Voting Rights and Share Pooling Agreement”) whereby the Issuer and IHO
Beteiligung, as pool members (together, the “Pool Members”), agreed to vote 24.01%, in the case of
the Issuer, and 1.00%, in the case of IHO Beteiligung, of the share capital held in each of Continental
AG and Vitesco AG as a unit. The purpose of the agreement is, inter alia, to pool the Pool Members’
interests and voting rights to secure influence in both Continental AG and Vitesco AG, by way of
consistent exercise of voting rights in annual general meetings and to provide for uniform decisionmaking with respect to any disposals of the pooled shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Issuer Voting
Rights and Share Pooling Agreement, the Pool Members are obliged to ensure that the shares held in
the pool continuously amount to more than 25% of the issued share capital of each of Continental AG
and Vitesco AG. Resolutions in the meeting of the pool members are taken with a simple majority.
Each pooled share of Continental AG and Vitesco AG, respectively, grants one vote in pool meetings.
The pooling agreement has been concluded for an indefinite term. The attribution rules under capital
markets law with regard to the total number of shares held by each of the pool members remain
unaffected.

**_Expense Reimbursement relating to the Offering_**

The Issuer has agreed to reimburse Schaeffler AG for its costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the Offering. We estimate that the reimbursed costs will be less than €1 million.

### Transactions of the Schaeffler Group

For a description of transactions of the Schaeffler Group with related parties, see note 5.4 to the
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 2022 and note 5.5 to the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements 2021, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Cooperation Agreements_**

Pursuant to a cooperation agreement, originally dated March 27, 2009 (as amended from time to
time), Continental AG and Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG, a subsidiary of Schaeffler AG, have
agreed to act as independent entities, but to try to create synergies through a worldwide purchasing
cooperation, (the “Continental Cooperation Agreement”). Similarly, pursuant to a joint procurement
cooperation agreement dated February 16/17, 2022, between Schaeffler AG and Vitesco
Technologies GmbH, a subsidiary of Vitesco AG, the parties have agreed to act as independent
entities, but to try to create synergies through a worldwide purchasing cooperation (the “Vitesco
**Cooperation Agreement”). In addition, pursuant to a triparty purchasing cooperation agreement**
dated October 27, 2022 (the “Triparty Purchasing Cooperation Agreement”) and a joint
procurement agreement for non-production material dated February 21, 2023 (the “Triparty
**Procurement Cooperation Agreement” and, together with the Triparty Purchasing Cooperation**
Agreement, the “Triparty Cooperation Agreements” and, together with the Continental Cooperation
Agreement, and the Vitesco Cooperation Agreement, the “Cooperation Agreements”), Continental
AG, Vitesco Technologies GmbH, a subsidiary of Vitesco AG and Schaeffler AG, have agreed to
combine the purchasing volume of all three companies in certain sourcing negotiations. The
Continental Cooperation Agreement and the Vitesco Cooperation Agreement remain applicable for
purchases outside the scope of the Triparty Cooperation Agreements.

The purpose of each of the Cooperation Agreements is to strengthen the market and negotiation
position of the respective parties under each of the Cooperation Agreements by cumulating their
respective purchasing volumes, allowing them to jointly negotiate lower prices and to achieve
advantageous conditions, including procuring higher quality and higher performance from suppliers.


-----

However, the actual purchase of the mutually sourced products is conducted independently by each
of the respective parties under the relevant agreement and for the respective party’s own account.

The Triparty Purchasing Cooperation Agreement has an initial term of 24 months and the Triparty
Procurement Cooperation Agreement has an initial term of twelve months. Each Cooperation
Agreement will be renewed automatically for consecutive twelve month periods unless cancelled by
written notice prior to the end of the respective term.

**_Interest-bearing loans_**

With respect to a convertible loan receivable from a joint venture we recorded an impairment of €22
million in 2020 and €0.6 million in 2021. In 2022, we sold the convertible loan receivable and
recognized a gain of €3 million for the impairment reversal.

**_Disposal of Business in Russia_**

On December 29, 2022, we signed an agreement to sell our two Russian subsidiaries,
Schaeffler RUS OOO and Schaeffler Russland OOO, to PromAvtoConsult LLC for a purchase price of
€10 million. In accordance with the terms of the sale agreement, the shares in PromAvtoConsult LLC
will be transferred to a company controlled by a member of the Supervisory Board of Schaeffler AG.
The closing of the transaction is subject the approval of Russian authorities. Russian law requires,
among others, that when share interests in Russian entities are sold, either (i) the purchase price is
made in installments over one to two years or (ii) 10% of the deal value is ‘voluntarily’ contributed to
the Russian government. In light of this requirement, we are currently negotiating with the purchaser
regarding a possible deferral of the purchase price payment. However, even if the transaction
complies with the relevant Russian legal requirements, there can be no assurance that the
transaction will be completed or that the Russian authorities will not impose additional
requirements.

_to the actual agreements. Unless defined herein, defined terms used in this “Description of Other_
_Indebtedness” have the meanings ascribed to them in the respective agreements described herein._

### Indebtedness of the Issuer 

**_Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement_**

Company, Citibank N.A., London Branch, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG and

and conditions of the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the lenders have made available to the
Issuer a €800 million revolving credit facility (the “Issuer Revolving Facility”), which matures on
December 31, 2024. The Issuer Revolving Facility is available for drawings in cash or, up to an
aggregate amount of €50 million, by way of ancillary facilities until one month prior to the final
maturity date. Any commitment undrawn on such dates will be cancelled. As of December 31, 2022,
€160 million was drawn under the Issuer Revolving Facility. Up to €50 million of the Issuer Revolving
Facility are available for drawing, in the form of ancillary facilities, on behalf and for the account of
the Issuer, by Atesteo, which were unutilized as of December 31, 2022. See “Certain Relationships
_and Related Party Transactions—Transactions of the Issuer—Atesteo Loan.”_

_Interest_

The Issuer Revolving Facility bears interest at a rate of EURIBOR (provided that EURIBOR, if below
zero, will be deemed to be zero) plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by
reference to the leverage ratio in accordance with a margin ratchet mechanism in a range between
1.75% and 4.25% per annum. Accrued interest on the loans drawn under the Issuer Revolving Facility
will be payable in cash on the last day of each interest period but in any event on the date falling at
six-monthly intervals after the first day of the interest period of a loan. The rate and time of payment
of interest, commission, fees and any other remuneration in respect of ancillary facilities to the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement are agreed between the relevant ancillary lender and the borrower
of the relevant ancillary facility.

_Purpose_

The Issuer Revolving Facility may be used for general corporate purposes of any member of the IHO
Group (consisting of INA-Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co. KG (“IHO”) and its subsidiaries but excluding
any Designated Non-Issuer Group Entity (as defined below)) or costs and expenses of any Restricted
Person (as defined in the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement) (including the payment of taxes).

The Borrower may also (i) fund any such purpose from sources other than the Issuer Revolving
Facility and apply amounts borrowed by it under the Issuer Revolving Facility towards refinancing of
such funding and/or (ii) for application towards the relevant purpose, where applicable, on-lend,
distribute or otherwise pass on amounts borrowed by it under the Issuer Revolving Facility to IHO
Beteiligungs GmbH (previously named Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH), the relevant member of the
IHO Group or, as the case may be, the relevant Restricted Person.


-----

_Repayment_

Each loan made under the Issuer Revolving Facility will be repaid (subject to an ability to roll over
drawings on a cash-less basis) on the last day of the interest period relating thereto and all amounts
outstanding under the Issuer Revolving Facility shall be repaid on the fifth anniversary of the date of
the most recent amendment and restatement agreement to the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement. Amounts repaid on loans made under the Issuer Revolving Facility may be re-borrowed
during the availability period applicable to it.

_Prepayment and cancellation_

Subject to certain conditions, the Issuer may voluntarily prepay its utilizations and/or permanently
cancel all or part of the available commitments under the Issuer Revolving Facility.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement requires mandatory
prepayment of the loans made available under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement in full or in
part in certain circumstances, including (i) with respect to any lender (or any holding company of a
lender), in full if it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for such lender to perform any of
its obligations under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement or to fund or maintain its
participation in any loans and (ii) with respect to any lender who so requires, in full following a
specified negotiation period if the Schaeffler Family ceases to own (directly or indirectly) or ceases to
hold (directly or indirectly) the right to exercise in their free discretion more than 50% of the share
capital and voting rights in the Issuer or the Issuer ceases to own (directly or indirectly) more than
50% of the voting shares in Schaeffler AG or otherwise loses control over Schaeffler AG (although
such lender will, at the request of the Issuer, assign at par its commitment and participation in any
facility to another lender willing to accept such assignment, subject to certain conditions).

The Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreements further provides that the Issuer shall apply an amount
equal to the net proceeds (the “Proceeds”) received by (i) any Restricted Person or any member of
the Issuer Group in connection with any direct or indirect sale, transfer or other disposal (whether
voluntary or involuntary, pursuant to a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of shares
in the Issuer and/or shares in Schaeffler AG which are subject to transaction security held by any
member of the Issuer Group (except for any disposal to any member of the Issuer Group) and (ii) a
member of the Issuer Group in connection with the sale, transfer or other disposal (whether
voluntary or involuntary, pursuant to a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
Restricted Continental Shares or Restricted Continental Spin-Off Shares (each as defined in the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement and which includes Vitesco AG shares since its spin-off from
Continental AG in September 2021) by any member of the Issuer Group, at its discretion, either (A) in
full towards the cancellation of the Issuer Revolving Facility (and, to the extent necessary,
prepayment of the loans made available thereunder) or (B) towards the cancellation of the Issuer
Revolving Facility (and, to the extent necessary, prepayment of the loans made available thereunder)
and the payment, redemption or voluntary prepayment of any other financial indebtedness of the
Issuer Group which is regulated by the Issuer Group Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement
(including under any hedging agreement) pro rata to their respective nominal amounts.

_Security_

The Issuer Revolving Facility is, or as the case may be, will be, secured by security over (i) a certain
number of shares in Continental AG, (ii) a certain number of shares in Vitesco AG and any other
entity resulting from any demerger of business activities from Continental AG to the effect that all
shares in such entity are held by the shareholders of Continental AG and, as applicable, Continental
AG (“Continental Spin-Off”) and (iii) a certain number of shares in Schaeffler AG in accordance with
the terms of the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement.


-----

If Continental AG or, as the case may be, Vitesco AG or any other Continental Spin-Off effects a
capital increase from capital reserves, a share split or any measure having a similar effect, the
number of shares in Continental AG or, as the case may be, Vitesco AG or the relevant Continental
Spin-Off which are required to be pledged as transaction security would increase in proportion to the
increase in the number of outstanding Continental AG shares or, as the case may be, Vitesco AG or
the relevant Continental Spin-Off.

Security over shares in Continental AG, Vitesco AG, any other Continental Spin-Off or Schaeffler AG
securing the Issuer Revolving Facility will be released if the relevant shares are disposed of in
accordance with the terms of the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement (subject to certain
prerequisites as the case may be, including application of the relevant Proceeds in mandatory
prepayment as set out above and provided that the number of shares in Schaeffler AG required to be
pledged as transaction security must not fall below the number of shares in Schaeffler AG which
represents 50% plus one share of each of the voting shares and the share capital of Schaeffler AG at
any time).

_Financial Covenants_

In respect of its financial condition, the Issuer must comply with a leverage financial covenant as set
out in the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement on each specified testing date, being the last date of
the relevant testing period (which is a period of twelve months ending on each of March 31,
June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year), by reference to the latest financial
statements or management accounts determined (i) on a consolidated basis for Schaeffler AG, (ii) on
an unconsolidated basis or, if it has subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis for any other entity (other
than a Restricted Person) in which a member of the Issuer Group directly holds or acquires more than
50% of the voting rights and share capital (together with Schaeffler AG, the “Majority Owned
**Entities”).**

The Issuer must ensure that the sum of (A) the ratio of the aggregate amount of the total net debt (as
calculated in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement)
on the relevant testing date of all members of the Issuer Group (for the avoidance of doubt, not
taking into account any borrowings of any member of the Schaeffler Group or any other Majority
Owned Entity) to HoldCo Earnings (as defined below) for the 12-month period ending on the relevant
testing date; and (B) the ratio of the aggregate amount of total net debt (as calculated in accordance
with the terms and provisions of the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement) of all Majority Owned
Entities which are not members of Issuer Group to the sum of the EBITDA of all Majority Owned
Entities which are not members of Issuer Group for the 12-month period ending on the relevant
testing date (in each case as calculated in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement) (the “Issuer Leverage Ratio”) is not more than 6.50:1 for any testing
date falling on or prior to June 30, 2023, 6.00:1 for any testing date falling on September 30, 2023
and on December 31, 2023, 5.50:1 for any testing date falling on March 31, 2024 and on June 30,
2024 and 5.00:1 for any testing date falling on or after September 30, 2024, where “HoldCo
**Earnings” means, in respect to any relevant 12-month period, the sum of (i) (as the case may be,**
consolidated) EBITDA of all Majority Owned Entities for the relevant Period ending on the relevant
testing date (as calculated in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement and on a pro rata basis, i.e., taking into account, for any Majority Owned Entity
which is not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Issuer, such portion of EBITDA which
proportionally corresponds to the Issuer’s (direct or indirect) shareholding in such Majority Owned
Entity); (ii) dividend income received by any member of the Issuer Group during the relevant 12month period from any entity which does not qualify as a Majority Owned Entity; and (iii) any
interest received by any member of the Issuer Group during the relevant 12-month period from any
cash or cash equivalent investments; while (iv) deducting the sum of certain operational costs
incurred by all members of the Issuer Group during the relevant 12-month period.

Shares in Continental AG, Vitesco AG or any other Continental Spin-Off which are subject to
transaction security can be disposed of at any time, provided that the disposal is made on arm’s
length and for fair market value and the net proceeds from any such share disposal are used, to the
extent required under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement, to cancel the Issuer Revolving
Facility and, as the case may be, prepay the loans made available thereunder.

Shares in Continental AG, Vitesco AG or any other Continental Spin-Off which are not subject to

Syndicated Facilities Agreement, do not have to be subject to transaction security may be disposed of

arms’ length terms and effected while no event of default under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement is continuing.

**_Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement_**

_Overview_

On September 7, 2016, IHO Beteiligungs GmbH (previously named Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH) as
parent and the Issuer as obligor and security provider entered into a security pooling and
intercreditor agreement (the “Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement”) (as amended
on September 9, 2016) governing the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the obligor(s)
named therein; (ii) the security provider(s) named therein; (iii) certain intra-group creditors (if any)
and debtors named therein; (iv) the syndicated facilities lenders named therein; (v) the hedge
counterparties under certain hedging agreements named therein; (vi) Deutsche Bank AG, Filiale
Luxemburg as security trustee (the “Security Trustee”); (vii) Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as


-----

facility agent under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement and (viii) the trustee for the Existing
Issuer Notes and the trustee(s) for any notes, including the Notes, that accede(s) to the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement in the future. By accepting a Note, the holders of the
Notes shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement.

The Issuer (which is referred to in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement as
“Company”), the obligor(s) and the provider(s) of the Transaction Security are referred to in this
description as “Debtors.”

The syndicated facilities lenders, the hedge counterparties, the Security Trustee, each facility agent
(which, together, are parties to the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement from time to time), each
notes trustee that has acceded to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, including
the Trustee for the Notes and the trustee for the Existing Issuer Notes, and the holders of the notes
that will be subject to the Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement (including the Notes, the
Existing Issuer Notes and any future notes with respect to which a Notes Effective Date (as defined
below) occurs) together, the “Note Holders” are referred to in this description as “Creditors.”

The Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law. It sets out:

  - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness owed to the Creditors;

  - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtor(s);

  - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness owed to the Creditors;

  - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness by the Creditors;

  - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of
certain insolvency events;

  - turnover provisions; and

  - when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the Transaction Security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement that relate to the rights and obligations of the Note
Holders and our other senior creditors. It does not restate the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions relating to the rights and
obligations of other classes of our debt and debt of our ultimate parent entity, IHO Beteiligungs
GmbH (previously named Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH), or capital expenditures. As such, we urge
you to read the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety because it, and not
the description that follows, defines the rights of the holders of the Notes. In this summary,
capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement, unless the contrary is otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires.

_Ranking and priority_

Each of the parties to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement will agree that the
liabilities owed by the members of the Issuer Group to (i) the lenders under the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement, the Note Holders and certain hedge counterparties (such liabilities being
collectively referred to as the “Senior Liabilities” and such creditors being “Secured Creditors”), (ii)
IHO Beteiligungs GmbH (previously named Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH), any member of the Parent
Group or any other Restricted Person (each as defined below) (such liabilities being referred to
together as the “Parent Liabilities”) and (iii) certain members of the Issuer Group (the “Intra-Group
**Liabilities”) will rank in right and priority of payment in the following order and will be postponed**
and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:


-----

  - the Senior Liabilities (pari passu, without any preference among such liabilities);

  - the Intra-Group Liabilities (pari passu, without any preference among such liabilities); and

  - the Parent Liabilities (pari passu, without any preference among such liabilities).

In this description, “Parent Group” refers to INA-Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co. KG together with its
subsidiaries from time to time (excluding the Issuer and its subsidiaries), and “Restricted Person”
means any direct or indirect shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective affiliates (except for
any member of the Issuer Group, any member of the Schaeffler Group, any member of the
Continental Group and any entity or group of entities in respect of which the Issuer has notified the
facility agent under and in accordance with the Issuer Syndicated Facilities Agreement or, if no Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement is in place, the Security Trustee that such entity or group of entities
shall not constitute a member of the Issuer Group).

The Parent Liabilities are and will remain unguaranteed and unsecured by any member of the Issuer
Group and of the Schaeffler Group. Prior to the date on which all Senior Liabilities have been fully
discharged (“Senior Discharge Date”), the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Parent Liabilities shall
comply with the provisions set out in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement. The
ranking and priority set forth above shall apply regardless of the order of registration, filing, notice or
execution of any document; the date upon which the liability was incurred or arose; whether a
person is obliged to advance any such liability; and any fluctuations in the outstanding amount, or
any intermediate discharge in whole or in part of any liability.

Each of the parties to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement will agree that the
Transaction Security shall rank and secure the Senior Liabilities pari passu and without any
preference between the Secured Creditors.

_Transaction Security_

The Transaction Security is shared between the Note Holders, certain hedge counterparties, the
holders of any pari passu additional debt and the lenders under the Issuer Syndicated Facilities
Agreement and includes pledges over certain shares in Schaeffler AG and certain shares in
Continental AG. No such Secured Creditor will be entitled to take the benefit of any guarantee or
security unless such guarantee or security is also offered for the benefit of the other Secured
Creditors. The Transaction Security will rank and secure the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured
Creditors pari passu and without any preference between them, provided that with respect to any
Notes Liabilities any Accessory Security Interest will secure only the relevant Notes Parallel Debt
Obligations or any other parallel debt obligation in favor of the Security Trustee and none of the
Transaction Security shall rank and secure any of the Subordinated Liabilities.

In addition, the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Guarantees
and Transaction Security will be released in certain circumstances described further below in “—
_Release of Transaction Security and Guarantees: Disposals.”_

_Subordinated Liabilities_

Each of the parties to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement agrees that the IntraGroup Liabilities and the Parent Liabilities are subordinated to the Senior Liabilities. Each of the
parties to the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement agrees that the Parent Liabilities
are subordinated to the Intra-Group Liabilities.


-----

_Note Creditors and Notes Liabilities_

Payment of Notes Liabilities

Prior to any Enforcement Action, the Debtor(s) may make Payments of the Notes Liabilities at any

as trustee for the other Secured Creditors in respect of the liabilities owed to them; or (ii) in
the case of any jurisdiction in which effective Security cannot be granted in favor of the
Security Trustee as trustee for the relevant Secured Creditors, as the case may be, (a) to the
other Secured Creditors in respect of the liabilities owed to them; or (b) to the Security Trustee
under a parallel debt structure for the benefit of the other Secured Creditors, and ranks in the
same order of priority as that described under the caption “—Ranking and priority” provided
that all amounts received or recovered by any Secured Creditor with respect to such Security
are paid to the Security Trustee to the extent required under the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement (for example, as described under the caption “—Turnover of
_Receipts”) and held and applied in the manner described under the caption “—Application of_
_Proceeds”; and_

  - any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the Notes Liabilities in
addition to those in (i) the Notes Documents in their form at the date of the Issuer Security

that described under the caption “—Ranking and priority,” provided that all amounts received
or recovered by any Secured Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or other

Intercreditor Agreement and except for amendments to Notes Documents to effect the issuance of
Notes (including Additional Notes) subject to and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and the other Transaction Finance Documents,
any amendment of any term of the Notes Documents which results in any increase of any amount of
principal, interest or fees shall not be permitted and shall be disregarded for all purposes of the


-----

Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, unless consented to in writing by each facility
agent.

Option to purchase: Note Holders

Following any Enforcement Action, the relevant Notes Trustee may, at the direction and the expense
of the relevant Note Holders (the “Purchasing Holders”), if (i) it gives not less than 15 Business Days’
prior written notice to each facility agent in respect of the facilities agreement and if applicable, the
hedge counterparties; and (ii) prior to giving any such notice, it obtains all necessary approvals from
the Purchasing Holders, acquire or procure the acquisition by a person nominated by the relevant
Notes Trustee on behalf of (and at the direction and expense of) the Purchasing Holders of all (but
not part only) of the rights and obligations of the lenders under the relevant facilities agreement and
the hedge counterparties in connection with the liabilities under the finance documents and the
liabilities under the hedging agreements by way of transfer under the relevant provision of the Issuer
Syndicated Facilities Agreement or the corresponding provision in any other finance documents or
relevant hedging agreement.

Restriction on Enforcement: Note Holders

Subject to the description in the two paragraphs below and certain provisions of the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement relating to hedge counterparties and hedging liabilities, each
Note Holder shall be entitled to take any Enforcement Action at any time in its several sole discretion
in respect of the Notes Liabilities other than steps relating to the enforcement of Transaction Security
or insolvency proceedings in respect of a Debtor which the Instructing Group must consent to.

If the Instructing Group provides consent to any Secured Creditor to take any Enforcement Action,
such consent shall apply equally to all Note Holders to take the same Enforcement Action and notice
of such consent shall be provided to all the Agents and the Security Trustee and each hedge
counterparty at the same time.

Notwithstanding the above or anything to the contrary in the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, each
Note Holder may, to the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Notes Documents, take certain
Enforcement Action and/or claim in the winding-up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or
similar insolvency event of that Debtor for Notes Liabilities owing to it (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, may not direct the Security Trustee to enforce the Transaction Security in any manner other
than as a member of the Instructing Group).

_Subordination on Insolvency_

entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Issuer Group in respect of
liabilities owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for
the distribution of the assets of that member of the Issuer Group to pay that distribution to the
Security Trustee until the liabilities owing to the Secured Creditors have been paid in full.

The Security Trustee shall apply distributions paid to it as provided for in the Issuer Security Pooling
and Intercreditor Agreement and as described under “—Application of Proceeds.”

the extent that any member of the Issuer Group’s liabilities is discharged by way of set-off
(mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of


-----

the Issuer Group, any Creditor (and in case of any Notes Trustee, subject to the provisions of the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described under the caption “—Turnover of
_Receipts”), which benefited from that set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the_
liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Trustee for application as
described under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

Filing of claims

Without prejudice to provisions relating to set-off as described above, after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in relation to any member of the Issuer Group, each Creditor irrevocably authorizes
the Security Trustee, on its behalf, to:

  - take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement) against that member of the Issuer Group;

  - demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Issuer Group’s
liabilities;

  - collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the Issuer
Group’s liabilities; and

  - file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Trustee considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of the Issuer Group’s liabilities.

Creditors’ actions

Each Creditor (in the case of each Notes Trustee, acting solely on behalf of the relevant Note Holders
and subject as provided in “—Turnover of Receipts—Exclusions”) will do all things that the Security
Trustee requests; and if the Security Trustee is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated
by the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement or if the Security Trustee requests that a
Creditor take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the
Security Trustee or grant a power of attorney to the Security Trustee (on such terms as the Security
Trustee may reasonably require) to enable the Security Trustee to take such action.

Security Trustee’s instructions

The Security Trustee shall act on the instructions of the Instructing Group entitled, at that time, to
give instructions under the relevant provisions of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Turnover of Receipts_

Turnover by the Creditors

distribution of the relevant amount.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

Enforcement Instructions

Following an Enforcement Decision, the Transaction Security shall be enforced by the Security
Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, the
relevant Transaction Security Document and the Enforcement Decision.

If requested by a Facility Agent, a Notes Trustee or the Instructing Group, the Security Trustee shall
notify the Debtors, the Issuer and/or the Security Providers (or any of them) of the occurrence of any
Default, Event of Default or acceleration (howsoever described) under any of the Transaction Finance
Documents as required under any Transaction Security Document (referred to under the relevant
Transaction Security Document as “Default Notice”), provided that the enforcement of any
Transaction Security may only be requested by the Instructing Group. Without prejudice to the
foregoing and subject as described under the caption “—Decisions of the Instructing Group,” the
Security Trustee shall not enforce (or, as the case may be, instruct any Secured Creditor to enforce)
any of the Transaction Security unless an Enforcement Decision has been made directing it to do so.
If requested by the relevant Facility Agent, a Notes Trustee or the Instructing Group, the Security
Trustee shall revoke the Default Notice specified in such request vis-à-vis the Issuer and the Debtors
and/or the Security Providers which had previously received such Default Notice.

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the
Instructing Group may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Trustee to enforce or
refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security as it sees fit.

Manner of enforcement

At any time after an Enforcement Decision has been made, the Security Trustee shall notify the
Debtors, the Issuer and/or the Security Providers (or any of them) of such Enforcement Decision in
writing (referred to under the relevant Transaction Security Document as “Enforcement Notice”) and
the Security Trustee shall, subject to the terms and conditions of such Enforcement Decision and the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, commence with and initiate such measures as
the Security Trustee may deem appropriate, necessary or advisable for the enforcement of all or part
of the relevant Transaction Security in accordance with the Enforcement Decision, the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and the provisions of the relevant Transaction Security
Documents.

The Secured Creditors (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any creditor in respect of a Permitted
Refinancing or Permitted Financing and (if acceded) any agent, trustee or representative appointed
by any such creditor) acknowledge and agree with each other that:

  - none of the Secured Creditors shall exercise any independent power to enforce any of the
Transaction Security (or to exercise any rights, remedies, discretions or powers or to grant any
consents or releases relating to the Transaction Security under or pursuant to the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Finance Documents in
particular, but not limited to cases where it is a direct party to any Transaction Security
Document as pledgee or otherwise) or otherwise have direct recourse to any of the


-----

Transaction Security other than with the consent of the Security Trustee holding the respective
Transaction Security (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group); and

  - none of the Secured Creditors shall be entitled to act individually to require the Security
Trustee to take any action or proceedings under or in relation to the Transaction Security
and/or the Transaction Security Documents or to exercise any of the rights, powers or
discretions conferred on it by the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement or the
Transaction Security Documents, other than in its capacity as a member of the Instructing
Group.

Exercise of voting rights

Each Creditor (in the case of each Notes Trustee, acting solely on behalf of, and as directed by, the
relevant Note Holders in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Documents) agrees with
the Security Trustee that it will (save, in the case of a Secured Creditor, where to do so would be
unlawful and/or contradictory to its obligations under any applicable legislation) cast its vote in any
proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in
respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any
member of the Issuer Group as instructed by the Security Trustee.

The Security Trustee shall give instructions as directed by the Instructing Group.

The provisions of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described above shall not
entitle any party to exercise or require any other Secured Creditor to exercise such power of voting
or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for repayment of or reschedule
any of the Senior Liabilities.

Waiver of rights

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to the provisions set forth in the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described under the captions “—Enforcement
_Instructions,” “—Manner of enforcement,” “—Distressed Disposals,” and “—Application of Proceeds,”_
each of the Secured Creditors and each of the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to
require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any
particular time or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other security interest, which is capable of
being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations is so applied.

Assignment and waiver of liabilities

Subject to the condition precedent that (i) an Enforcement Decision has been taken and (ii) notice
has been given by the Security Trustee that such waiver shall become effective, the Parent and each
Intra-Group Lender, if any, waives any and all claims it may or will have against any of the Debtors
arising under or in respect of the Transaction Security (including its enforcement), in particular,
without limitation, claims for reimbursement, and any of its claims under any Intra-Group Liability or,
as the case maybe, Parent Liability to the extent so notified by the Security Trustee.

_Release of Transaction Security and Guarantees: Disposals_

Non-Distressed Disposals: General

If, prior to an Enforcement Decision, in respect of a disposal of any asset by a Security Provider which
is subject to any Transaction Security:

  - each Facility Agent has: (i) notified the Security Trustee that such disposal and the release of
the relevant Transaction Security is not prohibited under the Finance Documents (with respect


-----

to which such Facility Agent acts as facility agent); and (ii) instructed the Security Trustee to
release the relevant Transaction Security encumbering such asset; and

  - each Notes Trustee has: (i) notified the Security Trustee that such disposal and the release of
the relevant Transaction Security is not prohibited under the respective Notes Document (with
respect to which such Notes Trustee acts as Notes Trustee); and (ii) instructed the Security
Trustee to release the relevant Transaction Security encumbering such asset,

(a “Non-Distressed Disposal”),

the Security Trustee is irrevocably authorized and instructed by all Secured Creditors (at the cost of
the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor) to comply with such instructions and:

  - to release the Transaction Security and/or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over
that asset;

  - where that asset consists of shares in the capital of or interest in a member of the Issuer
Group, to release the Transaction Security and/or any other claim (relating to a Debt
Document) over that member of the Issuer Group’s assets and those of any of its Subsidiaries
as well as all Secured Obligations and all Guarantees and any Parallel Debt Obligation (but not
only part thereof) owed by that member of the Issuer Group or any of its Subsidiaries, upon
such member of the Issuer Group ceasing to be a Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of such
disposal; and

  - to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction Security or any claim
described above and grant all consents, execute all agreements and make all other
declarations (including, without limitation, any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing) that may, in the discretion of the Security Trustee, be
considered necessary or desirable,

in its own name and on its own behalf and in the name and on behalf of each of the Secured
Creditors without the need for any referral to, or authority from, any Secured Creditor.

If that Non-Distressed Disposal is not made, each release of Transaction Security or any claim
described above shall have no effect and the Transaction Security or claim subject to that release
shall continue in such force and effect as if that release had not been effected (in each case to the
extent legally possible) and the Debtors shall take all action reasonably requested by the Security
Trustee to confirm or retake the relevant Transaction Security.

Application of Proceeds resulting from Non-Distressed Disposals

The Parties agree that if, and to the extent pursuant to the terms of any Transaction Finance
Document, any proceeds resulting from any disposal of an asset in accordance with the description
under “—Non-Distressed Disposals: General” must be applied towards a prepayment of any
obligations outstanding under the relevant Transaction Finance Documents (each a “Mandatory
**Prepayment Event”), then any prepayment of the Secured Obligations which would result from such**
Mandatory Prepayment Event shall be made (and any proceeds received by any member of the
Issuer Group in connection with that Mandatory Prepayment Event shall be applied) in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Transaction Finance Document(s).

Distressed Disposals

If, following an Enforcement Decision:

  - the Security Trustee (acting on the instructions of or with the consent of the Instructing Group)
sells or otherwise disposes of any Charged Property;


-----

  - the relevant Security Provider concerned sells or otherwise disposes of such asset at the
request of the Security Trustee (acting on the instructions of or with the consent of the
Instructing Group); or

  - a Receiver sells or otherwise disposes of such asset with the consent of the Security Trustee
(acting on the instructions of or with the consent of the Instructing Group),

(a “Distressed Disposal”),

the Security Trustee is authorized to execute on behalf of itself and in the name and on behalf of
each Secured Creditor, without the need for any further referral to or authority from any Secured
Creditor:

  - to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver
or enter into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of
the Security Trustee, be considered necessary or desirable;

  - if the asset which is sold or disposed of (either as a result of the enforcement of the
Transaction Security or as a result of a disposal of shares by a Security Provider at the request
of or (in the case of a disposal by a receiver) with the consent of the Security Trustee (in each
case acting on the instructions of or with the consent of the Instructing Group)) consists of the
shares in the capital of an Obligor (other than the Issuer or any issuer of Notes), to release on
behalf of the relevant Creditors and Debtors:

− that Obligor and any Subsidiary of that Obligor from all of its Liabilities; all Parallel Debt
Obligations (but not only part thereof); and all Guarantees it may have to (i) any Security
Provider or other Obligor, both actual and contingent, in its capacity as a guarantor,
security provider or borrower or otherwise (including any liability to any Security Provider
or other Obligor by way of guarantee, contribution, subrogation, assignment by operation
of law (cessio legis) or indemnity) or (ii) any Secured Creditor, both actual and contingent,
in its capacity as a guarantor, security provider or Obligor under the Parallel Debt
Obligations; and

− any Transaction Security granted by that Obligor or any Subsidiary of that Obligor over any
of its assets under any of the Transaction Security Documents;

  - if the asset which is sold or disposed of (either as a result of the enforcement of the
Transaction Security or as a result of a disposal of shares by a Security Provider at the request
of or (in the case of a disposal by a receiver) with the consent of the Security Trustee (in each
case acting on the instructions of or with the consent of the Instructing Group)) consists of the
shares in the capital of any Holding Company of an Obligor (other than the Issuer or any issuer
of Notes), to release on behalf of the relevant Creditors and Debtors:

− that Holding Company and any Subsidiary of that Holding Company from: all of its
Liabilities; all Parallel Debt Obligations (but not only part thereof); and all Guarantees it may
have to (i) any Security Provider or other Obligor, both actual and contingent, in its capacity
as a guarantor, security provider or borrower or otherwise (including any liability to any
Security Provider or other Obligor by way of guarantee, contribution, subrogation,
assignment by operation of law (cessio legis) or indemnity) or (ii) any Secured Creditor,
both actual and contingent, in its capacity as a guarantor, security provider or Obligor
under the Parallel Debt Obligations; and

− any Transaction Security granted by any Subsidiary of that Holding Company over any of its
assets;


-----

  - if the asset which is sold or disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor or the
Holding Company of an Obligor and the Security Trustee decides to sell or dispose of: all of the
liabilities; all Parallel Debt Obligations (but not only part thereof); and all Guarantees owed by
that Obligor or Holding Company to (i) any Security Provider or other Obligor, both actual and
contingent, in its capacity as a guarantor, security provider or borrower or otherwise or (ii) to
any Secured Creditor, both actual and contingent, in its capacity as a guarantor, security
provider or Obligor under the Parallel Debt Obligations, to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to sell or dispose of all or part of any such liabilities, Parallel Debt Obligations
and Guarantees, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors and Debtors.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any release of liabilities, if
any) shall be paid to the Security Trustee for application in accordance with the provisions set forth
under “—Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the
Transaction Security.

In the absence of any instructions of the Instructing Group requesting the Security Trustee to enter
into (or not to enter into, as the case may be) a disposal for a specific consideration and subject
always to the provisions set forth under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security—Enforcement
_Instructions,” the Security Trustee shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the_
prevailing market conditions (though the Security Trustee shall not have any obligation to postpone
any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

Creditors’ and Debtors’ actions

Each Creditor (in the case of each Notes Trustee, acting solely on behalf of, and as directed by, the
relevant Note Holders in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Documents) and Debtor
will do all things that the Security Trustee requests in order to give effect to the release of
Transaction Security and Guarantees Disposals (which shall include, without limitation, the execution
of any assignments, transfers, releases or other documents (including special power of attorney for
the benefit of the Security Trustee)) that the Security Trustee may consider to be necessary to give
effect to the releases or disposals contemplated hereunder; and if the Security Trustee is not entitled
to take any of the actions contemplated hereunder or if the Security Trustee requests that any
Creditor or Debtor take any such action, take that action itself in accordance with the instructions of
the Security Trustee (in the case of each Notes Trustee, acting solely on behalf of, and as directed by,
the relevant Note Holders in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Documents), provided
that the proceeds of those disposals are applied in accordance with the provisions described under
“—Application of Proceeds resulting from Non-Distressed Disposals” or under “—Distressed
_Disposals,” as the case may be._

_Release of Transaction Security and Guarantees: General_

Transaction Security

If, prior to an Enforcement Decision, each Facility Agent and each Notes Trustee has delivered to the
Security Trustee the Release Notification, the Security Trustee:

  - shall as soon as reasonably practicable release the Transaction Security specified in such
notification in accordance with such notification; and

  - is irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Secured Creditors (at the cost of the relevant
Security Provider or the Issuer and without the need for any further consent, authority or
further confirmation from any Secured Creditor or Debtor):

− to release such Transaction Security; and


-----

− to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the relevant Transaction Security and
grant all consents, execute all agreements and make all other declarations that may, in the
discretion of the Security Trustee, be considered necessary or expedient, in its own name
and on its own behalf and in the name and on behalf of each of the Secured Creditors
without the need for any referral to, or authority from, any Secured Creditor.

If, following a release of such Transaction Security, the Issuer or any other member of the Issuer
Group is required pursuant to the Transaction Finance Documents to reinstate Transaction Security
previously released, then such Transaction Security has to be reinstated (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any asset (including any shares or interest in any entity) disposed
of (whether by way of asset or share deal) in the meantime where that disposal was permitted
pursuant to the terms of the Facilities Agreement(s) and the Notes Documents).

General

The Security Trustee shall not release any Transaction Security (or any part thereof) other than
pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement
described under the captions “—Release of Transaction Security and Guarantees: Disposals” and “—
_Accession of Debt and Collateralization—Transaction Security” without the prior consent of each_
Facility Agent and Notes Trustee.

If the Security Trustee is required to release any Transaction Security by operation of law, any
approval shall only be required for the selection (if legally permissible) of the Transaction Security
which is to be released.

If each Facility Agent and each Notes Trustee have notified the Security Trustee that the Facilities
Liabilities and the Notes Liabilities have been unconditionally and irrevocably discharged in full and
the Issuer has requested the Security Trustee to do so, the Security Trustee shall (and is authorized
by each other Secured Creditor to) release, confirm any extinction by operation of law, re-assign or
re-transfer, as appropriate, to the relevant Security Provider the Transaction Security and the Parallel
Debt Obligations in its own name and in the name and on behalf of any other Secured Creditor
holding the relevant Transaction Security, as the case may be, without the need for any further
referral to or authority from any other Secured Creditors, save to the extent that the Security Trustee
is required to transfer such Security or any surplus proceeds to any third party by mandatory law.
Each Secured Creditor shall make any declarations and perform any other acts which are necessary to
give full force and effect to any release of Transaction Security pursuant to the provisions set forth in
the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described under the caption “—Release of
_Transaction Security and Guarantees: Disposals.”_

_Application of Proceeds_

Order of application

Subject to the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement
described under the caption “—Prospective liabilities and determination of quotas,” the proceeds
shall be held by the Security Trustee on trust and, to the extent permitted by applicable mandatory
law, be applied by it towards discharging the claims of the Creditors in the following order of priority
(in each case only if and to the extent that the payments and provisions of a higher priority have
been made in full):

  - **_first,_** in or towards discharging pro rata all expenses incurred by the Security Trustee, or by any
person appointed by the Security Trustee, by any Notes Trustee and by any Facility Agent;

  - **_second,_** in payment to: each Facility Agent on behalf of the relevant Finance Parties for
application towards the discharge of the Facilities Liabilities; each Notes Trustee on behalf of
its respective Note Holders for application towards the discharge of the Notes Liabilities; and


-----

the Hedge Counterparties for application towards the discharge of the Hedging Liabilities, on a
pro rata, pari passu basis;

  - **_third,_** in payment to any other person if and to the extent the Security Trustee or any other
Secured Creditor having received the relevant Transaction Security is obliged by law to make
such payment in priority to any Security Provider;

  - **_fourth,_** in payment pro rata to the relevant Intra-Group Lender towards the discharge of the
Intra-Group Liabilities;

  - **_fifth,_** if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any
Transaction Finance Document and no Intra-Group Liabilities are outstanding, in payment to
the Parent towards the discharge of any Parent Liabilities; and

  - **_sixth,_** the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

Application of proceeds by Security Trustee

Any Agent other than the Security Trustee receiving any proceeds shall without undue delay forward
such proceeds it has received to the Security Trustee for distribution pursuant to the provisions set
forth in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and described under the caption “—
_Order of application.”_

Prospective liabilities and determination of quotas

Following an Enforcement Decision, the Security Trustee may in its discretion hold an amount of the
proceeds in an interest-bearing suspense or impersonal account in the name of the Security Trustee
with such financial institution (including itself) and for as long as the Security Trustee shall think fit
(the interest being credited to the relevant account) for later application under the provisions set
forth in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described under the caption “—
_Order of application” in respect of:_

  - sums (other than interest amounts) notified by the Secured Creditors to the Security Trustee
that may become payable in the future under the Transaction Finance Documents in
connection with any of the claims of the relevant secured creditor (in particular, without
limitation, in case of letters of credit or guarantees) the exact amount of which cannot, at the
date notified by the Security Trustee, be finally determined and which may not be covered by
future proceeds);

  - sums as the Security Trustee reasonably considers may become payable in the future in
respect of expenses and which it considers may not be covered by future proceeds;

  - any part of the Senior Liabilities that the Security Trustee reasonably considers may become
payable in the future;

  - any sums the Security Trustee has received and with respect to which it reasonably considers
that payment of such sums may be avoided or subject to draw-back from it (in particular, but
not limited to, as a result of the realization of Transaction Security with respect to which any
hardening periods or new hardening periods have or may have commenced (and not been
completed) in connection with a Permitted Refinancing or a Permitted Financing) pursuant to
legal and/or insolvency proceedings instituted in respect of the relevant member of the Issuer
Group; and

  - any sums the Security Trustee has received and with respect to which it reasonably considers
that the relevant Secured Creditor is not entitled under applicable mandatory law to receive or
to retain such sums,


-----

and the retained funds shall be distributed only once it has been finally determined whether and to
what extent the claims expected by the Secured Creditors have actually materialized, provided that if
and to the extent any funds retained for the benefit of one or more Secured Creditors have been
contested by any other Secured Creditor, the relevant funds shall be finally distributed upon the
earlier of:

  - the Security Trustee having received from each of the Secured Creditors for the benefit of
which the relevant funds have been retained its written consent as to the distribution of the
relevant funds; or

  - any of the Secured Creditors having notified the Security Trustee in writing of any court
judgment, court or administration order or any other ruling, which permits enforcement
against the relevant party providing evidence (satisfactory to the Security Trustee) that the
claims expected by the Secured Creditors for the benefit of which the relevant funds have
been retained have actually materialized or (as the case may be) that any future
materialization of such claims may be excluded. Claims in connection with guarantees or
letters of credit shall be deemed to have been materialized in case any payment has been
made under them by the relevant Secured Creditor.

The Security Trustee is entitled to refrain from the distribution of proceeds resulting from the
enforcement of Transaction Security, if and for as long as, pursuant to the terms of the relevant
Transaction Security Document, the Security Trustee may be required to return (all or part of) such
proceeds to the relevant Transaction Security Provider as a result of an outstanding determination by
an auditor (or any other independent third party) of the amount which is enforceable and may be
retained in respect of such Transaction Security.

As long as the amount of any right and claim eligible for the distribution of proceeds is not finally
determined, such right and claim shall generally not be considered in the determination of the
distribution quotas. A definite determination of the distribution quotas shall only be made when
each of the Secured Creditors has notified the Security Trustee in writing that all amounts of the
respective rights and claims eligible for the distribution of proceeds have been determined finally. On
the basis of such notices, the Security Trustee shall calculate the share of each Secured Creditor in
the proceeds to be distributed in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described under the caption “—Order of application.” If and to
the extent such shares and/or amounts have been contested by any Secured Creditor before the
respective date which has been duly notified by the Security Trustee to the Secured Creditors for this
purpose, the Security Trustee may refrain from the final distribution and the proceeds shall be finally
distributed upon the earlier of:

  - the Security Trustee having received from each of the Secured Creditors its written consent (in
the case of each Notes Trustee, acting solely on behalf of, and as directed by, the relevant
Note Holders in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Documents) as to the
distribution of the relevant funds; or

  - any of the Secured Creditors having notified the Security Trustee in writing (in the case of each
Notes Trustee, acting solely on behalf of, and as directed by, the relevant Note Holders in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Documents) of an enforceable title providing
evidence (satisfactory to the Security Trustee) as to the calculation of such share and/or
amounts.

If the application of such definite distribution quotas would lead to a different allocation of any
proceeds that have already been distributed, corresponding compensation payments shall be made
among the relevant Secured Creditors if and to the extent necessary to reflect the definite
distribution quotas.


-----

Investment of proceeds

Prior to the application of the proceeds in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described under the caption “—Order of application,”
the Security Trustee may, in its discretion, hold all or part of those proceeds in an interest-bearing
suspense or impersonal account(s) in the name of the Security Trustee with such financial institution
(including itself) and for so long as the Security Trustee shall think fit (the interest being credited to
the relevant account) pending the application from time to time of those monies in the Security
Trustee’s discretion in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement in this section “—Application of Proceeds.”

Permitted Deductions

The Security Trustee shall be entitled, in its discretion, (a) to set aside by way of reserve amounts
required to meet and (b) to make and pay, any deductions and withholdings (on account of taxes or
otherwise) which it is or may be required by any applicable law to make from any distribution or
payment made by it under the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, and to pay all
Taxes which may be assessed against it in respect of any of the Transaction Security, or as a
consequence of performing its duties, or by virtue of its capacity as Security Trustee under any of the
Debt Documents or otherwise (other than in connection with its remuneration for performing its
duties under the Transaction Finance Documents).

provisions of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer or any other
member of the Issuer Group may refinance or replace the Facilities Liabilities (including replacement
of any undrawn commitment under the Finance Documents) and/or the Notes Liabilities, in each
case in whole or in part, by way of a senior secured facilities financing (such refinancing or
replacement, the “Senior Facilities Refinancing”) and/or issuance of Notes (the “Notes Refinancing,”
together with the Senior Facilities Refinancing, the “Senior Refinancing”), if:

  - the obligations of each borrower and guarantor under such Senior Refinancing will rank pari
_passu, without preference or priority, with all of its obligations under the Transaction Finance_
Documents and will rank ahead of the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Parent Liabilities;

  - at such time no acceleration event or event of default has occurred and is continuing under
any Transaction Finance Document;

  - such Senior Refinancing is not prohibited under the relevant Notes Documents of any Notes
then outstanding;

creditors) in respect of such Senior Refinancing accedes to the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement.

All liabilities incurred under any Permitted Refinancing will become Secured Obligations, be treated
for all purposes of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement in the same way as the


-----

refinanced Secured Obligations and rank accordingly as Senior Liabilities in accordance with the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
be secured by the Transaction Security existing as of the date such liabilities are incurred pari passu
with the then existing Senior Liabilities, provided that:

to such Senior Facilities Refinancing.

New Debt

Subject to the terms and provisions of all Transaction Finance Documents including the specific
provisions of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer or any other
member of the Issuer Group may increase or restructure any Facilities Liabilities and/or incur new
Liabilities under a senior secured facilities financing (the “Senior Facilities Financing”) and/or issue
Notes (the “Notes Financing” together with the Senior Facilities Financing and the financing set out
below, the “Senior Financing”), in each case in whole or in part, if:

  - the obligations of each borrower and guarantor under such Senior Financing will rank pari
_passu, without preference or priority, with all of its obligations under the Transaction Finance_
Documents and will rank ahead of the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Parent Liabilities;

  - at such time no acceleration event and no event of default has occurred and is continuing
under any Transaction Finance Document;

creditors) in respect of such Senior Financing accedes to the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security
Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement.

All liabilities incurred in connection with any Permitted Financing will become Secured Obligations,
be treated for all purposes of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement in the same
way as any other Secured Obligations and rank accordingly as Senior Liabilities in accordance with the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
be secured by the Transaction Security existing as of the date such liabilities are incurred pari passu
with the then existing Senior Liabilities, provided that:

  - in case of a Notes Financing, the Notes Effective Date has occurred with respect to such Notes;
and

  - in case of a Senior Facilities Financing, the Facilities Effective Date has occurred with respect to
such Senior Facilities Financing.

Nothing in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement shall affect or limit the rights of
any member of the Issuer Group to take out, issue or incur indebtedness under any bilateral or
syndicated loan or credit financing or any bonds, notes or similar instruments if and to the extent:

  - the relevant indebtedness thus incurred is not secured by any asset which is subject to
Transaction Security; and


-----

  - such take-out, issue and/or incurrence is not prohibited pursuant to the Finance Documents
and the Notes Documents in each case under which any Facilities Liabilities or, as the case may
be, Notes Liabilities are outstanding.

-----

**Effective Date” in relation to such Senior Facilities Refinancing or Senior Facilities Financing and such**

Decisions of Secured Creditors

With respect to any Notes, the Security Trustee may submit the question whether from a legal
perspective the conclusion of the Security Confirmation Agreement(s) and/or the provision of Lower
Ranking Security and/or any Local Law Security Amendment Agreement (in each case as set out in
the instruction under the caption “—Notes Effective Date,” or “—Facilities Effective Date”), will or
will not adversely affect any Transaction Security granted to the Security Trustee or any other
Secured Creditor as of that time and the legal opinions referred to under the provisions set forth
under the caption “—Notes Effective Date,” or “—Facilities Effective Date,” to the Facility Agent(s)
and the Notes Trustee(s). The Facility Agent(s) and the Notes Trustee(s) (acting solely on behalf of,
and as directed by, the relevant Note Holders in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes
Documents) may waive the requirements set out under the provisions described under the captions
“—Notes Effective Date,” and “—Facilities Effective Date” by an unanimous instruction issued by all
Facility Agent(s) and all Notes Trustee(s) (in the case of the Notes Trustee acting as specified above)
to the Security Trustee.

If the Security Trustee has submitted the question referred to above to the Facility Agent(s) and the
Notes Trustee(s), then the Security Trustee shall prior to having received an unanimous instruction
issued by all Facility Agent(s) and all Notes Trustee(s) waiving the requirements set out under the
captions “—Notes Effective Date,” and/or “—Facilities Effective Date,” respectively, be under no
obligation to provide any notice that a Notes Effective Date or a Facilities Effective Date has occurred.

Transaction Security

In case of any Non-accessory Security Interest, the Security Trustee (without the need for any further
referral to or authority from any Secured Creditor) shall be authorized to agree to a confirmation of
the Notes Parallel Debt Obligations or SFA Parallel Debt Obligations, as the case may be, and a
confirmation and/or amendment of the terms of the Transaction Security Documents creating and
recording such Non-accessory Security Interest, in order that, such Non-accessory Security Interest
shall serve to secure all relevant Notes Liabilities and/or Facilities Liabilities (including those in
respect of which the Notes Effective Date or Facilities Effective Date, as the case may be, has been or
is intended to be declared) and the other Secured Obligations equally and ratably, in each case
subject to the terms of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement (any such
confirmation and/or amendment agreement, a “Security Confirmation Agreement”). Each Security
Provider and each Secured Creditor (in the case of each Notes Trustee, acting solely on behalf of, and
as directed by, the relevant Note Holders in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes
Documents) shall make any declaration and take any action which is necessary or expedient to effect
such amendment of the relevant Transaction Security Document to which it is a party.

In case of any Accessory Security Interest, (i) the relevant Transaction Security Document shall not be
amended or released as a result of the occurrence of the relevant Notes Effective Date or Facilities
Effective Date and (ii) upon the occurrence of the relevant Notes Effective Date or Facilities Effective
Date, as the case may be, each Security Provider shall instead as soon as reasonably practicable after
the relevant instruction grant, for the purpose of securing (y) the relevant Notes Parallel Debt
Obligations, SFA Parallel Debt Obligations or any other parallel debt obligation in favor of the Security
Trustee, as the case may be, and (z) to the extent such Accessory Security Interest also secures SFA
Principal Obligations, the relevant SFA Principal Obligations incurred under the Senior Facilities
Refinancing or Senior Facilities Financing, additional Security for the benefit of the Security Trustee
over any asset which is already subject to any Transaction Security in the form of such a security
interest (but not over any other of its assets) which shall rank immediately behind any Security
previously granted over such asset (such Security, the “Lower Ranking Security”). In case of a Senior


-----

Facilities Refinancing or Senior Facilities Financing, Lower Ranking Security shall also be granted to
the creditors of such Senior Facilities Refinancing or Senior Facilities Financing, if the relevant
Accessory Security Interest has also been granted to the creditors of the SFA Principal Obligations.
Any Lower Ranking Security shall form part of the Transaction Security and be subject to the
provisions of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement.

In case of any security interest created under any Transaction Security Document governed by
German law, the Security Trustee (without the need for any further referral to or authority from any
Secured Creditor) shall be authorized to agree with the relevant Obligor and/or Security Provider to a
(i) confirmation of the Notes Parallel Debt Obligation or SFA Parallel Debt Obligations, as the case
may be, and an amendment agreement governed by German law relating to any security interest
created by way of assignment or transfer of assets under the relevant Transaction Security
Documents governed by German law providing that such security interest shall secure all relevant
Notes Parallel Debt Obligations or SFA Parallel Debt Obligations, as the case may be, and the other
Secured Obligations, including the relevant Notes Liabilities or Facilities Liabilities, equally and
ratably, and (ii) Lower Ranking Security with respect to any security interest created by way of
pledges, in each case subject to the terms of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement
(any such agreement named above, a Local Law Security Amendment Agreement).

To the extent liabilities incurred under any Permitted Refinancing or Permitted Financing cannot be
secured pari passu with the then existing Senior Liabilities under the existing Transaction Security
Documents without the Transaction Security under such existing Transaction Security Documents
first being released, the Parties agree that the Security Trustee is authorized to release such existing
Transaction Security provided that immediately on such release, the Transaction Security released
shall be retaken and granted for the benefit of the Secured Creditors and the creditors in respect of
such Permitted Refinancing or Permitted Financing on terms substantially similar to the Transaction
Security Documents which governed the released Transaction Security and subject to the same
ranking as set forth in this section “—Transaction Security” and provided further that the Security
Trustee has received, in form and substance satisfactory to it, an opinion of counsel confirming that,
following such release and grant of Transaction Security, any new hardening period in respect of any
such Transaction Security retaken to secure the Senior Liabilities is no longer than any new hardening
periods in respect of such Transaction Security granted to secure the liabilities incurred under any
Permitted Refinancing or Permitted Financing and; the Security Trustee has received written
instructions from the Notes Trustee(s) (acting solely on behalf of, and as directed by, the relevant
Note Holders in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Documents) and Facility Agent(s) to
release and retake such Transaction Security.

_Decisions of the Instructing Group_

Resolutions

If, pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, a
decision, instruction or consent of the Instructing Group is required or requested by the Issuer, the
Security Trustee or any Secured Creditor (in case of the Finance Parties acting through the relevant
Facility Agent and in case of the Note Holders acting through the Notes Trustee(s)) the following shall
apply:

  - Any decision, instruction or consent of the Instructing Group for the purpose of the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Enforcement Decision relating to the enforcement of any Transaction Security) shall be made
in the form of resolutions.

  - For each issuance of Notes (and separately for series of Notes denominated in different
currencies), the relevant Notes Trustee shall determine, in accordance with the relevant Notes


-----

Documents and applicable laws, the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Notes
Participations under such issuance of Notes (or series of Notes, as the case may be) that have
(or is deemed under the relevant Notes Documents to have) voted in favor of (the “Notes
**Participations Approval Amount”) and against (the “Notes Participations Disapproval**
**Amount”) the relevant decision, instruction or consent under the Issuer Security Pooling and**
Intercreditor Agreement. The relevant Notes Trustee shall notify the Notes Participations
Approval Amount and the Notes Participations Disapproval Amount for such issuance of Notes
(separately for series of Notes denominated in different currencies) to the Security Trustee in
accordance with the procedure set forth in this section “—Resolutions.” If the Security Trustee
has not received any notification from a Notes Trustee within the relevant time period, the
Notes Participation under that issuance of Notes shall be disregarded in determining whether
a resolution is passed. For the avoidance of doubt, the underlying decisions by any Note
Holders shall be adopted by such Note Holders in accordance with the relevant Notes
Documents and applicable laws.

- For each Facilities Agreement (and separately for Bank Credit Participations under the same
Facilities Agreement where the underlying commitment is denominated in different base
currencies), the relevant Facility Agent shall determine, in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Facilities Agreement and applicable laws, the aggregate amount of Bank Credit
Participations under such Facilities Agreement that have (or is deemed or otherwise treated
under the relevant Facilities Agreement as having) voted in favor of (the “Bank Participations
**Approval Amount”) and against (the “Bank Participations Disapproval Amount”) the relevant**
decision, instruction or consent under the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement.
The relevant Facility Agent shall notify the Bank Participations Approval Amount and the Bank
Participations Disapproval Amount for such Facilities Agreement (as the case may be,
separately for Bank Credit Participations under the same Facilities Agreement where the
underlying commitment is denominated in different base currencies) to the Security Trustee in
accordance with the procedure set forth in this section “—Resolutions.” If the Security Trustee
has not received any notification from the Facility Agent within the relevant time period, the
Bank Credit Participation under that Facilities Agreement shall be disregarded in determining
whether a resolution is passed pursuant to the below. For the avoidance of doubt, the
underlying decisions by any Finance Parties shall be adopted by such Finance Parties in
accordance with the relevant Facilities Agreement to which they are a party and applicable
laws.

- In no event shall the sum of the Notes Participations Approval Amount and the Notes
Participations Disapproval Amount with respect to any issuance of Notes (or any series of
Notes denominated in different currencies, as the case may be) or the sum of the Bank
Participations Approval Amount and the Bank Participations Disapproval Amount with respect
to any Facilities Agreement (or the relevant Bank Credit Participations under that Facilities
Agreement where the underlying commitment is denominated in different base currencies)
exceed the aggregate Notes Participations under such issuance of Notes (or series of Notes, as
the case may be) or Bank Credit Participations under such Facilities Agreement (or such
relevant Bank Participations under that Facilities Agreement where the underlying
commitment is denominated in different base currencies), respectively. The Notes
Participations Approval Amounts and Notes Participations Disapproval Amounts for all
issuances of Notes (separately for series of Notes denominated in different currencies), the
Bank Participations Approval Amounts and Bank Participations Disapproval Amounts for all
Facilities Agreements (separately for Bank Credit Participations under the same Facilities
Agreement which are denominated in different base currencies) shall be determined by the
Security Trustee on the basis of the information obtained hereunder and in accordance with
the provisions set forth under the caption “Information” of the Issuer Security Pooling and


-----

Intercreditor Agreement on or before the Business Day preceding the date on which votes may
be submitted according to the below, and, if any such amount is denominated in a currency
other than the euro, the Security Trustee shall convert such amount into euro at the Spot Rate
of Exchange for the purchase in the foreign exchange market of the relevant foreign currency
as of the fifth Business Day preceding the date on which the relevant Resolution Notice (as
defined below) is dispatched by the Security Trustee.

  - A resolution is passed if the sum of (i) the aggregate Bank Participations Approval Amounts for
all Facilities Agreements; and (ii) the aggregate Notes Participations Approval Amounts for all
issuances of Notes, exceeds the sum of the aggregate Bank Participations Disapproval
Amounts for all Facilities Agreements; and the aggregate Notes Participations Disapproval
Amounts for all issuances of Notes, (in each case on a euro basis, converted pursuant to the
paragraph above) with respect to the relevant resolution.

  - Any resolution passed pursuant to the paragraph above is referred to as a decision or
resolution of the Instructing Group for the purposes of this Agreement, any Facilities
Agreement and, if required, the Transaction Security Documents and the Guarantee
Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, all Secured Creditors (including any Secured Creditor
who is not entitled to participate in or abstains from the voting) shall be bound by the decision
of the Instructing Group.

At the request of the Issuer or any Secured Creditor (in case of the Finance Parties acting through the
Facility Agent under, and subject to the provisions of, the Facilities Agreement to which such Finance
Party is a party and, in case of any Note Holders acting through the Notes Trustee(s) subject to the
provisions of the applicable Notes Documents), the Security Trustee shall request votes from the
Secured Creditors, subject to the above, by a notice to the Secured Creditors (in case of the Note
Holders, to the Notes Trustee(s) acting for or on account of the respective Note Holders, and in case
of the Finance Parties, to the Facility Agent acting for or on account of the respective Finance Parties)
(the “Resolution Notice”) which has to be (x) given by letter, facsimile or comparable means of
communication and/or (y) made available for a period of not less than ten Business Days on a
website the address of which has been notified by the Security Trustee to the Secured Creditors (in
case of the Note Holders, to the Notes Trustee(s) acting for or on account of the respective Note
Holders, and in case of the Finance Parties, to the Facility Agent acting for or on account of the
respective Finance Parties) at least five Business Days before dispatching the Resolution Notice (the
“Website”). The Resolution Notice shall specify the resolution to be voted on.

Resolution Notices relating to the same decision, instruction or consent shall be dispatched to all
classes of Secured Creditors entitled to vote on the same day and shall have substantially the same
content; provided that, for purposes of obtaining any consent of the Instructing Group under the
caption “Amendments: Finance Documents” of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement only, the Issuer may require, in a request made by it pursuant to the above, that the
Security Trustee give a Resolution Notice to, and obtain the results of the vote of, a class of Secured
Creditors entitled to vote before it gives such Resolution Notice to another class of Secured Creditors
entitled to vote (in which case the conversion rate for purposes of the above shall be the relevant
conversion rate as published as of the fifth Business Day preceding the date on which the first
Resolution Notice is dispatched). Should the aggregate Notes Participations Approval Amounts
and/or Bank Credit Participations Approval Amounts (in each case, converted into euro in accordance
with the above and the immediately preceding sentence) of the class or classes of Secured Creditors
which have voted on the matter constitute a majority of the Total Participations, the Security Trustee
shall refrain from delivering any further Resolution Notice relating to such matter to any other class
of Secured Creditors and notify the Issuer that the resolution has been duly passed.

The Notes Trustee(s) and the Facility Agent(s) shall submit the respective Notes Participations
Approval Amounts, Notes Participations Disapproval Amounts, Bank Participations Approval Amounts


-----

and Bank Participations Disapproval Amounts to the Security Trustee by letter, facsimile, any
comparable means or any means made available by the Security Trustee for this purpose on the
Website:

Resolution Notice, then the relevant Secured Creditor (in case of the Finance Parties, through
the respective Facility Agent, subject to the above) must return the respective vote within five
Business Days, and within three Business Days if it is stated in the Resolution Notice that the
resolution is urgent; and

  - in any other case, within 30 Business Days or any extended time limit set by the Security
Trustee in the Resolution Notice.

Only Notes Participations Approval Amounts, Notes Participations Disapproval Amounts, Bank
Participations Approval Amounts and Bank Participations Disapproval Amounts submitted to the
Security Trustee in accordance with, and within the relevant time period specified in, the paragraph
above shall be taken into consideration for purposes of determining whether a resolution has been
passed. The relevant time period shall commence on the date of receipt of the Resolution Notice by
the respective Secured Creditor (in case of the Finance Parties, through the respective Facility Agent
and, in case of any Note Holders, through the respective Notes Trustee(s)). Such notice shall be
deemed received by the relevant Secured Creditor (in case of the Finance Parties, through the
respective Facility Agent and, in case of the Note Holders, through the respective Notes Trustee), if
by letter, at noon two days after such letter was posted (or in the case of airmail, five days after the
letter was delivered to the custody of the postal services institutions), or if by facsimile, email, any
comparable means or by the Website during or before the business hours of the addressee, then on
the day of transmission, otherwise on the next following Business Day, in each case where the
Resolution Notice has been made to the address as provided for in the relevant notice provisions or
made available on the Website, as the case may be.

connection with any Finance Document (the “SFA Principal Obligations”) as and when the same fall
due for payment under the relevant Finance Document, or with respect to paragraph (ii) above,
under applicable statutory or other law, or would have fallen due but for any discharge resulting
from failure of another Secured Creditor to take appropriate steps, in insolvency proceedings
affecting that Obligor, to preserve its entitlement to be paid that amount (the “SFA Parallel Debt
**Obligations”).**

Each of the Obligors that is an issuer of any Notes (or guarantees any present or future sums,
liabilities or obligations (actual and contingent) owing by any member of the Issuer Group to any
Notes Trustee or any Note Holders under any Notes or any related Notes Document) irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees and undertakes with the Security Trustee, in each case subject to the
occurrence of a Notes Effective Date relating to such Notes (except with respect to the Notes offered
in the Offering), that each of them shall pay to the Security Trustee on the terms set out in the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement sums equal to, and in the currency of, any sums owing
by it to the relevant Notes Trustee or the relevant Note Holders (i) under the relevant Notes
Documents or (ii) out of unjust enrichment (including, but not limited to, the German law concept of
_ungerechtfertigte Bereicherung) or tort (including, but not limited to, the German law concept of_
_Delikt) under or in connection with any Notes Document (the “Notes Principal Obligations”) as and_
when the same fall due for payment under the relevant Notes Document, or with respect to
paragraph (ii) above, under applicable statutory or other law, or would have fallen due but for any
discharge resulting from failure of another Secured Creditor to take appropriate steps, in insolvency
proceedings affecting that Obligor, to preserve its entitlement to be paid that amount (the “Notes
**Parallel Debt Obligations”) it being acknowledged by all Parties that the existence and extent of the**
Notes Principal Obligations under the Notes Documents and therefore of the corresponding Notes
Parallel Debt Obligations shall be a matter for New York law in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Notes Documents.

Each of the Obligors that is a party to the Hedging Agreements irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees and undertakes with the Security Trustee that each of them shall pay to the Security Trustee
on the terms set out in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement sums equal to, and in
the currency of, any sums owing by it to the Hedge Counterparties (i) under the Hedging Agreements
or (ii) out of unjust enrichment (including, but not limited to, the German law concept of
_ungerechtfertigte Bereicherung) or tort (including, but not limited to, the German law concept of_
_Delikt) under or in connection with any Hedging Agreement (the “Hedging Principal Obligations,”_
and together with the SFA Principal Obligations and the Notes Principal Obligations, as Principal
Obligations) as and when the same fall due for payment under the relevant Hedging Agreement, or
with respect to paragraph (ii) above, under applicable statutory or other law, or would have fallen
due but for any discharge resulting from failure of another Secured Creditor to take appropriate
steps, in insolvency proceedings affecting that Obligor, to preserve its entitlement to be paid that
amount (the “Hedging Parallel Debt Obligations,” and together with the SFA Parallel Debt
Obligations and the Notes Parallel Debt Obligations, if any, the “Parallel Debt Obligations”).

The right of the Security Trustee on the terms set out in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement to demand payment of the Parallel Debt Obligations shall be independent and several
from the rights of the other Secured Creditors to demand payment of the Principal Obligations
_provided that (i) the payment by an Obligor of all or any part of its Parallel Debt Obligations to one or_
other or the Security Trustee shall also discharge (in the amount of the relevant payment) the
corresponding Principal Obligations (unless the respective Paying Agent has received payment of
such amount but not forwarded such amount to the respective Note Holders (in particular, by way of
forwarding to the relevant clearing system for such Notes (in accordance with the terms governing
such Notes) for distribution to the respective Note Holders)) and (ii) conversely the payment by an


-----

Obligor of all or any part of its Principal Obligations shall also discharge (in the amount of the relevant
payment) all corresponding Parallel Debt Obligations owed to the Security Trustee on the terms set
out in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Principal Obligation shall be discharged as a result of any voidness or voidability of the Parallel Debt
Obligations or any similar defense invoked by or on behalf of an Obligor vis-à-vis the Security Trustee.
No Obligor may declare a set-off or otherwise invoke any counterclaim against the Parallel Debt
Obligations.

Despite the foregoing, any payment:

(i) under the Finance Documents shall be made in accordance with the provisions set forth in
the Issuer Group Security and Pooling Agreement under the caption “Payment of Facilities
Liabilities” of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and the Finance
Documents;

(ii) under the Notes Documents shall be made in accordance with the provisions set forth in
the Issuer Group Security and Pooling Agreement under the caption “Note Creditors and
Notes Liabilities—Payment of Notes Liabilities;” or

(iii) under the Hedging Agreements (other than any Transaction Security Document or in
respect of any Guarantee) shall be made to the relevant Hedge Counterparty unless
expressly stated otherwise in the relevant Hedging Agreements.

Notwithstanding the above, the Security Trustee will be fully entitled, on the basis of the parallel
debt undertakings stated above, to (y) request payment of any of the amounts which in accordance
with paragraphs (i) to (iii) above have to be paid to the relevant Facility Agent, any other Finance
Party, the Paying Agent(s), the Notes Trustees or the Hedge Counterparties, respectively, if the
relevant Principal Obligation was not paid when due; and (z) enforce the Transaction Security granted
in its favor on the basis of the Parallel Debt Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Issuer
Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement if such request is not fulfilled.

Without limiting or otherwise affecting the Security Trustee’s rights against any Obligor, the Security
Trustee agrees with each other Secured Creditor (in case of any Note Holders, acting through the
Notes Trustee(s)) (on a several basis) that (subject to the below) it will not exercise its rights under
the Parallel Debt Obligations except with the consent of the relevant Secured Creditors under the
respective Principal Obligations or, in case of the Notes Principal Obligations, with the consent of the
relevant Notes Trustee(s).

Nothing shall in any way limit each of the Security Trustee’s rights to act in the protection or
preservation of rights under any Transaction Security Document or to enforce any Transaction
Security as contemplated by the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant
Transaction Security Document or any other Transaction Finance Document (or to do any act
reasonably incidental to the foregoing).

Equalization

If, for any reason, any Senior Liabilities remain unpaid after the Enforcement Date and the resulting
losses and deficiencies affecting the Secured Creditors are not in proportion to the ratio of their
respective Exposure at the Enforcement Date to the aggregate Exposures of all the Secured Creditors
at the Enforcement Date, the Secured Creditors (in case of any Note Holders), through the Notes
Trustee(s), subject to the provisions set forth in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement described under the caption “—Turnover of Receipts—Turnover by the Creditors” above,
will make such payments among themselves as the Security Trustee shall require to put the Secured
Creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses and
deficiencies are borne in those proportions.


-----

Turnover of enforcement proceeds

If:

  - the Security Trustee is not entitled, for reasons of applicable law, to pay amounts received
pursuant to the making of a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss or the enforcement of the Transaction Security to the Secured Creditors but is
entitled to distribute those amounts to creditors (such creditors, the “Receiving Creditors”)
who, in accordance with the terms of the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement,
are subordinated in right and priority of payment to the Secured Creditors; and

  - the Senior Discharge Date has not yet occurred (nor would occur after taking into account such
payments),

then the Receiving Creditors (subject, in the case of the Notes Trustee(s), to the provisions set forth
in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement described under the caption “—Turnover
_of Receipts—Turnover by the Creditors” and the provisions of the relevant Notes Documents) shall_
make such payments to the Secured Creditors as the Security Trustee shall require to place the
Secured Creditors in the position they would have been in had such amounts been available for
application against the Senior Liabilities.

_Change of Finance Party or Note Holders_

Any Note Holders may transfer all or part of their Notes in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Notes Documents, and upon any such transfer the transferee shall have the rights and benefits of a
Note Holder under the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and be subject to the
limitations and obligations of a Note Holder under the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Consents, Amendments and Override_

Required consents

Subject to the below, the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or
waived with the consent of the Issuer, the Agents, and all Finance Parties provided that to the extent
an amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the interests
of any other class of Secured Creditors, only written agreement from any affected class shall be
required.

An amendment or waiver that has the effect of changing or which relates to the provisions set forth
in the Issuer Group Security and Pooling Agreement under the captions “Intra-Group Lenders and
_Intra-Group Liabilities,” “Parent and Parent Liabilities,” “Release of Transaction Security and_
_Guarantees: Disposals,” “Release of Transaction Security and Guarantees: General,” “Additional_
_Transaction Security,” “Costs and Expenses,” “Indemnities,” “Information” or “Notices” may be_
amended or waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the Security Trustee, the Notes Trustee(s)
and the relevant Facility Agent, but without the consent of any other Party.

If any amendment or waiver has the effect of changing or relates to the provisions set forth in the
Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement under the captions “Ranking/Subordinated
_Liabilities,” “Transaction Security,” “Hedge Counterparties and Hedging Liabilities,” “Turnover of_
_Receipts,” “Parallel Debt,” “Equalization,” or “Transaction costs and expenses,” “Secured Creditors’_
_indemnity,” “Information” or “Notices,” then such amendment or waiver shall in addition require the_
consent of each Hedge Counterparty. Any amendment or waiver which has the effect of changing or
which relates to “Application of Proceeds” shall only require the consent of each Hedge Counterparty
if such amendment or waiver would adversely affect the Hedge Counterparties.


-----

The Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement may be amended by the Facility Agent, the
Notes Trustees and the Security Trustee without the consent of any other Party to cure defects and
manifest errors, resolve ambiguities or to reflect changes in each case of a minor, technical or
administrative nature.

Agreement to override

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement, in the
case of any conflict between the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement and any other
Debt Document, the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.

_Termination_

Except for certain protective provisions for the benefit of the Security Trustee and the Notes Trustee,
the Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earlier
of the occurrence of the Senior Discharge Date and when all Transaction Security has been
irrevocably released or otherwise terminated.

### Indebtedness of the Schaeffler Group 

**_Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement_**

On November 2, 2022, Schaeffler AG entered into a syndicated ESG linked term loan and revolving
credit facilities agreement, with Schaeffler AG as borrower and, among others, Deutsche Bank AG
and UniCredit Bank AG as coordinators, mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners, Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt as facility agent and certain banks and financial institutions named
therein as original lenders. (as amended from time to time, the “Schaeffler Group Syndicated
**Facilities Agreement”).**

The Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement provides for a €500 million term loan credit
facility (the “Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility”) and a €2.0 billion multi‐currency (committed in
EUR only) revolving credit facility (the “Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility,” and together with the
Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility, the “Schaeffler Group Facilities”). Each of the Schaeffler Group
Facilities matures on November 2, 2027 (in relation to the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility, subject
to uncommitted extension options).

On January 2, 2023, we drew €350 million under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility and we
expect to draw the remaining €150 million available under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility in
March 2023. The Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility will be available for drawings until March 31,
2023. The Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility will be available for drawings until 30 days prior to the
final maturity date and may be utilized by way of drawings in cash. In addition, Schaeffler AG or any
of its subsidiaries may agree with a lender under the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility that such
lender (or any affiliate of any such lender) provides an ancillary facility on a bilateral basis in place of
all or part of the unutilized revolving commitment of that lender; an ancillary facility may be made
available by way of an overdraft facility, a guarantee or stand‐by letter of credit facility, a short‐term
loan facility, a current account or any other facility or accommodation agreed between Schaeffler AG
and the lender. The maximum amount of all commitments made available under ancillary facilities
must not exceed €1,000 million (with such limit to be increased or, as the case may be, reduced by
the same percentage as the total commitments under the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility are
increased pursuant to the increase option in relation to the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility or
reduced by way of cancellation).

As of December 31, 2022, the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility was unutilized and €55 million
were utilized under the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility in the form of letters of credit under
ancillary facilities provided thereunder. On January 2, 2023, we drew €350 million under the


-----

Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility and we expect to draw the remaining €150 million available
under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility in March 2023.

The Schaeffler Group Facilities are not secured by any collateral or any guarantee by any member of
the Schaeffler Group (other than by Schaeffler AG in respect of amounts owed under the Schaeffler
Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement by finance subsidiaries of Schaeffler AG, which may accede to
the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement from time to time as additional borrowers).

_Interest_

The Schaeffler Group Facilities bear interest, in case of euro loans, at a rate of EURIBOR, or, in the
case of loans drawn in any currency other than euro, a reference rate base rate to be agreed upon
between Schaeffler AG and the agent under the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement
(provided that EURIBOR is, if EURIBOR is below zero, zero), plus the applicable base margin and
plus/minus certain sustainability margin adjustments, if applicable. The applicable base margin is a
certain percentage per annum that is determined in accordance with a margin ratchet mechanism by
reference to the credit ratings solicited by Schaeffler AG and assigned to Schaeffler AG’s long‐term
debt by Moody’s and/or any of the other two rating agencies of international standing which were
market leaders on the date of the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement. Pursuant to that
base margin ratchet mechanism, the ranges of possible margins are (i) in respect of loans under the
Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility, from 2.50% per annum, in the case of a credit rating of BB-/Ba3
or equivalent or lower, to 1.25% per annum, in the case of a credit rating of BBB+/Baa1 or equivalent
or better and (ii) in respect of loans under the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility, from 1.60% per
annum, in the case of a credit rating of BB-/Ba3 or equivalent or lower, to 0.45% per annum, in the
case of a credit rating of BBB+/Baa1 or equivalent. A sustainability adjustment can be in a range of
minus 5 basis points per annum to plus 5 basis points per annum depending on the
achievement/failure to achieve specific sustainability performance target levels in relation to key
performance indicators referring to emissions, a lost time injury rate and/or any other sustainability
criteria agreed upon from time to time.

_Purpose_

The Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility may be used towards general corporate purposes of
Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries. The Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility was and/or may be used
towards the repayment of existing debt (except for amounts outstanding under the Schaeffler Group
Term Loan Facility) and general corporate purposes of Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries.

_(P)repayment/cancellation_

Any loan made available under the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility shall be repaid on the final
maturity date applicable to the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility. No borrower must reborrow any
part of the Schaeffler Group Term Loan Facility which is repaid. Any loan made available under the
Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility shall be repaid on the last day of its interest period and all
amounts outstanding under the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility shall be repaid on the final
maturity date (as extended as the case may be) applicable to the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility.

Subject to certain conditions, Schaeffler AG may voluntarily prepay its utilizations under the
Schaeffler Group Facilities and/or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under
the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility.

The Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement requires mandatory prepayment of the loans
made available under the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities in full with respect to any lender who
so requires (i) if it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for that lender to perform any of
its obligations under Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement or to fund or maintain its
participation in any loans, or (ii) (following a specified negotiation period) after the occurrence of a
change of control. In each case, any such lender is required, at the request of Schaeffler AG, to assign


-----

at par its commitment and participations in the Schaeffler Group Facilities to another (existing or
new) lender willing to accept such assignment, subject to certain conditions.

_Financial Covenant_

Until the date on which a credit rating, solicited by Schaeffler AG, of Baa2/BBB (or equivalent) or
better has been assigned to Schaeffler AG’s long‐term debt by any two of Moody’s and either of the
other two rating agencies of international standing, which were market leaders on the date of the
Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement (the “Fall‐Away Date”), Schaeffler AG must ensure
that the ratio of consolidated total net debt on any testing date to adjusted consolidated EBITDA
(both as calculated in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Schaeffler Group Syndicated
Facilities Agreement) (the “Schaeffler Group **Leverage Ratio”) for the relevant testing period is not**
more than (i) 3.75:1 or (ii) 4.25:1 in respect of any of the next following four testing dates falling after
the date of closing of an acquisition which complies with certain prerequisites (including Schaeffler
AG giving notice to the facility agent of such acquisition). Compliance with the Schaeffler Group
Leverage Ratio is tested as of the last date of each relevant testing period (which is a period of twelve
months ending on each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year) by
reference to Schaeffler AG’s latest consolidated financial statements. For this purpose, Schaeffler
AG’s consolidated total net debt is calculated as of each testing date and Schaeffler AG’s adjusted
consolidated EBITDA is calculated for the testing period ending on the relevant testing date.

_General covenants_

The Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement provides for certain restrictive covenants
customary for these types of financings subject to certain specified exceptions provided for in the
Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement in respect of the relevant covenant (customized to
the business of Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries and adjusted to the current credit standing of
Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries). Such restrictive covenants include restrictions on (i) the granting
of security for financial indebtedness (“negative pledge”), (ii) asset disposals by Schaeffler AG or
certain other material members of the Schaeffler Group (together, the “Material Schaeffler Group
**Members”), (iii) the incurrence of financial indebtedness by any material subsidiary of Schaeffler AG**
(other than any finance subsidiary), (iv) (prior to the occurrence of the Fall‐Away Date) the granting
of loans or credit by any Material Schaeffler Group Member, (v) mergers and other reorganization
measures involving any Material Schaeffler Group Member, (vii) substantial changes to the general
nature of the business of Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and (viii) anticorruption laws and sanctions. Additionally, Schaeffler AG has the obligation to provide certain
financial information and other information regarding its (consolidated (if applicable)) financial
condition to the lenders under the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement. In addition, the
Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement requires Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries to
observe certain customary affirmative covenants (subject to agreed exceptions and qualifications)
including in relation to the obtaining of and compliance with any required authorizations, compliance
with laws and maintenance of pari passu ranking of unsecured debt obligations. The covenants do
not include restrictions on Schaeffler AG’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise make distributions to
the Issuer.

_Events of Default_

The Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains customary events of default, the
occurrence of which would allow the lenders to cancel their commitments, declare that all or part of
the loans together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding under the
finance documents be immediately due and payable (or payable on demand) or declare that all or
part of the amounts outstanding under any ancillary facilities be immediately due and payable (or
payable on demand).


-----

These events of default, subject to certain agreed grace periods and exceptions, include, without
limitation:

(a) failure to make payment of amounts due and payable in connection with the Schaeffler Group
Syndicated Facilities Agreement;

(b) (prior to the occurrence of the Fall‐Away Date) failure to comply with the financial covenant;

(c) a cross‐default with respect to other financial indebtedness of Schaeffler AG and/or any other
Material Schaeffler Group Member (to be relaxed following the Fall‐Away Date), subject to a
threshold of €125 million in aggregate;

(d) certain insolvency events or proceedings in relation to a Material Schaeffler Group Member (as
defined in the Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement); and

(e) certain creditors’ processes, including expropriations, attachments or sequestration of assets
or similar events affecting assets of a Material Schaeffler Group Member (as defined in the
Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement), subject to a threshold of €75 million in
aggregate.

_Fall‐Away Date: fall‐away of covenants_

The Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement provides for a mechanism according to which
certain covenants will fall away or relax (as applicable) upon the occurrence of the Fall‐Away Date,
_inter alia, in respect of:_

  - the financial covenant (and, consequentially, the related event of default ceases to apply); and

  - the restrictions on the granting of loans or credit.

_Governing Law_

The Schaeffler Group Syndicated Facilities Agreement and any non‐contractual obligations arising out
of or in connection with it are governed by German law.

**_Schaeffler Group Notes_**

On March 26, 2019, Schaeffler AG issued €2,200 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes
(€750 million of 1.125% senior notes due 2022, €800 million of 1.875% senior notes due 2024 and
€650 million of 2.875% senior notes due 2027) and on October 12, 2020 an additional €1,500 million
in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (€750 million of 2.750% senior notes due 2025 and
€750 million of 3.375% senior notes due 2028) under its €7,500 million debt issuance program (the
“Schaeffler Group Notes”), in each case in a private transaction not subject to the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Schaeffler AG redeemed €205 million in principal amount of
the Schaeffler Group Notes due 2022 on October 14, 2020 and redeemed the remaining Schaeffler
Group Notes due 2022 on March 1, 2022.

Interest on the Schaeffler Group Notes due 2024 accrues at the rate of 1.875% per annum, interest
on the Schaeffler Group Notes due 2025 accrues at a rate of 2.2750% per annum, interest on the
Schaeffler Group Notes due 2027 accrues at the rate of 2.875% per annum and interest on the
Schaeffler Group Notes due 2028 accrues at a rate of 3.375% per annum. Interest on the Schaeffler
Group Notes is payable in euro annually in arrears.

The terms of the Schaeffler Group Notes restrict the ability of Schaeffler AG to create certain liens
securing capital markets indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. Under the terms of the
Schaeffler Group Notes, upon the occurrence of a change of control in combination with certain
ratings downgrade events, each holder of notes is entitled to require Schaeffler AG to redeem in


-----

whole or in part its Schaeffler Group Notes at their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest.

The terms of the Schaeffler Group Notes also provide for events of default, including cross
acceleration with respect to capital markets indebtedness in an aggregate amount of at least €100
million, entitling the holders to demand immediate repayment of the Schaeffler Group Notes.

The Schaeffler Group Notes are governed by German law.

**_Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes (Schuldscheine)_**

In 2020, Schaeffler AG issued €557 million in aggregate principal amount of promissory notes
(Schuldscheine) in various tranches of which €298 million (book value: €297 million) were
outstanding as of December 31, 2022 (the “Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes”). In October 2021,
Schaeffler AG redeemed €259 million in principal amount of promissory notes due 2023. €5 million of
the Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes mature on May 11, 2023, €167 million mature on May 12,
2025, €76 million mature on May 11, 2028 and €50 million mature on May 13, 2030.

Loans under the Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes may be used towards general corporate
purposes of Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the
Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes was used to refinance a portfolio of projects focusing on products
for zero-emission mobility such as electric motors and electric axles as well as products for
generating climate-friendly energy using wind power, and to invest in making our worldwide
production more sustainable with respect to minimizing waste and waste water and reducing energy
consumption.

Depending on the tranche, the loans issued under a Schaeffler Group Promissory Note have either a
fixed or a floating interest rate. Each loan utilized under a Schaeffler Group Promissory Note must be
repaid on its respective maturity date. Schaeffler AG may permanently cancel and voluntarily prepay
the respective loan under a Schaeffler Group Promissory Note in accordance with mandatory law.

Each Schaeffler Group Promissory Note requires mandatory prepayment of the respective loan made
available thereunder in full, if the relevant lender so requires (following a specified negotiation
period), after the occurrence of a change of control.

Each Schaeffler Group Promissory Note provides for certain restrictive covenants customary for these
type of financing (and substantially equivalent to the relevant provisions of the Schaeffler Group
Syndicated Facility Agreement) subject to certain specified exceptions.

The Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes are unsecured and not guaranteed by any of Schaeffler AG’s
subsidiaries. They rank pari passu among themselves and pari passu with all other unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of Schaeffler AG. The Schaeffler Group Promissory Notes are governed by
German law.

**_Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper Program_**

In December 2019, we established a multi-currency commercial paper program, providing a
framework for the issuance by Schaeffler AG of short-term commercial paper (“Schaeffler Group
**Commercial Paper”) in the money markets (the “Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper Program”).**
The maximum amount permitted to be outstanding under the Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper
Program is €1 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had utilized €50 million (book value: €50 million)
of the Schaeffler Group Commercial Paper Program. The notes rank pari passu among themselves
and pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Schaeffler AG. The
program and issuances thereunder are governed by German law.


-----

**_Schaeffler Group Factoring Program_**

In 2021, we established a non-recourse factoring program (as amended and restated from time to
time, the “Schaeffler Group Factoring Program”) with a factor (the “Factor”). Under the program,
the Factor has agreed to purchase receivables originated by Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG, in
its ordinary course of business, up to a maximum amount of €200 million, at a purchase price equal
to the nominal amount of the receivable, in exchange for certain fees and financing costs paid to the
Factor. The Schaeffler Group Factoring Program contains certain covenants including relating to the
terms of the invoices and administration of the accounts receivable. The Schaeffler Group Factoring
Program has an initial term of 36 months, ending in 2024, and automatically renews for one year
terms thereafter. During the initial term, and at any time, either party may terminate the contract for
good cause, which includes a material breach by one party such that the other party cannot
reasonably be expected to fulfill the contract and a change of control of the general partner of
Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG. Following the initial term, either party may terminate the
agreement with three months’ notice. As of December 31, 2022, we had utilized €166 million of the
Schaeffler Group Factoring Program.

**_Other Schaeffler Group lines of credit_**

In addition to the debt instruments described above, we had further committed bilateral lines of
credit with certain banks in the equivalent of approximately €118 million as of December 31, 2022, of
which an aggregate principal amount of €17 million was utilized as of December 31, 2022, primarily
in the form of letters of credit.

## Description of the Notes

IHO Verwaltungs GmbH (the “Issuer”) will issue the Notes (as defined below) under an indenture to
be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”) among, inter alios, itself as issuer, Deutsche Trustee
Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and Deutsche Bank AG, Luxembourg Branch, as security
trustee (the “Security Trustee”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”).

Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this “Description of the Notes” to the Notes
include any Additional Notes (as defined below) that are issued. See “Important Information about
_this Offering Memorandum.” The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The_
Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended. The Security Documents referred to below under the caption “—Security” define
the terms of the security that will secure the Notes.

Payment under the Notes will be linked to certain sustainability-related key performance indicators,
as described herein.

The Issuer will use the gross proceeds from the Offering, together with cash on hand, (i) to redeem
€500 million in principal amount of the Existing 2025 Euro Notes, including the payment of accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, up until the redemption date for the Redeemed Issuer Notes and (ii) to
pay related fees and expenses. Subject to successful completion of the Offering, the Issuer expects to
redeem the Redeemed Issuer Notes on or about May 15, 2023.

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer
depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries and any dividends and distributions it receives from its
investment in shares of Continental and Vitesco to meet its obligations under the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to our Financing—The Issuer depends on dividend payments from Schaeffler_
_AG, Continental AG and Vitesco to meet its debt service obligations.”_

The Indenture, the Notes and any future Note Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into in the future. The
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the
Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and any Note Guarantees. Please see “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Issuer—Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor Agreement” for a_
summary of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the
Notes and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. This summary,
including the references to the Intercreditor Agreement and Security Documents appearing herein,
does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all
provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents,
respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to
you. We urge you to read the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes (the
“Holders”). Copies of the Indenture, the form of the Notes, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth below under “—Additional information.”

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain definitions.”
Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain definitions”
have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. In this description, the term “Issuer” refers
only to IHO Verwaltungs GmbH and not to any of its Subsidiaries, and the term “Schaeffler AG” refers
only to Schaeffler AG and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of a Note for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

### Brief description of the Notes

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

- will be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

- will, together with the obligations under the Existing Issuer Notes, the Issuer Revolving Facility
Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations, be secured by the Collateral as described below
under “—Security;”

- will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries,
including indebtedness of the Schaeffler OpCo Group;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of property
and assets securing such obligations;

- will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that
are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations of the Issuer in
respect of the Existing Issuer Notes and the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement;

- will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (if any); and

- will be effectively senior to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that are not secured by
the Collateral owned by the Issuer to the extent of the value of such Collateral.

As of the Issue Date, none of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any Subsidiary of the Issuer, such Subsidiary will pay the
holders of its debt and its trade creditors before it will be able to distribute any of its assets to the
Issuer. In the future, under certain limited circumstances, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer may
guarantee the Notes as described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Issuances of
_Guarantees of Indebtedness.”_

Holders of the Notes will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of non-guarantor
Subsidiaries (including Schaeffler AG and its Subsidiaries) and none of such non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will have any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes
or to make funds available to the Issuer for those purposes. Certain legal and contractual restrictions
will limit the Issuer’s ability to access the cash flow of its Subsidiaries, including legal restrictions on
the payment of corporate dividends. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness
and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of any nonguarantor Subsidiary of the Issuer. Any right of the Issuer to receive assets of its Subsidiaries upon
that Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate
in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors.

As of December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer would
have €2,976 million outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money other than the Notes, consisting
of €2,816 million (equivalent) outstanding under the Existing Issuer Notes (other than the Redeemed
Issuer Notes) and €160 million under the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement. In addition, as of
December 31, 2022, after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer would have had €640 million
available for drawing under the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, on a
_pro forma basis after giving effect to the drawing of €500 million under the Schaeffler Group Term_
Loan Facility (of which €350 million were drawn on January 2, 2023 and €150 million are expected to
be drawn in March 2023) and the incurrence of €3 million of acquired debt, each in connection with
the Ewellix Acquisition, Schaeffler AG had €3,813 million of indebtedness outstanding on a


-----

consolidated basis (excluding €219 million of lease obligations). See “Capitalization”. In addition, as
of December 31, 2022, Schaeffler AG and certain of its Subsidiaries had €2,000 million available for
drawing under the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility of the Schaeffler Group Facilities.

As of the Issue Date, none of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will be a “Restricted Subsidiary” for purposes of
the Indenture. Schaeffler AG and its Subsidiaries will be “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee
the Notes and will not provide any collateral securing the Notes. As a consequence, holders of the
Notes will have no recourse to any Unrestricted Subsidiary or its properties if there is an event of
default under the indenture governing the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our Financing—
_The Issuer may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its debt service obligations” and_
“—Risks related to the Notes and our Structure—Schaeffler AG and its subsidiaries will be
_Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in_
_the Indenture, will not guarantee the Notes and will not provide any Collateral.”_

Under certain circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain covenants—Designation
_of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Members of Issuer Group and OpCo Group,” the Issuer_
will be permitted to designate additional Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and Unrestricted
Subsidiaries (including Schaeffler AG and its Subsidiaries) as “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

### Principal and maturity 

The Issuer will issue €500 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured PIK toggle notes
due 2028 (the “Notes”) in the Offering.

The Issuer may issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) under the Indenture from time to time
after the Offering. The Notes may be issued in one or more series under the Indenture. Any issuance
of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant
described below under the caption “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The Notes
and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for
all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions
and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, provided, that unless the
Additional Notes are fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional
Notes will not be issued under the same ISIN as the Notes. The Issuer will issue Notes in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof. Additional PIK Notes (as
defined below) may be issued in minimum denominations of €1.

The Notes will mature on [], 2028. The redemption price at maturity will equal 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes redeemed.

### Interest 

Cash interest on the Notes will initially accrue at the rate of [] % per annum, subject to the Interest
Step-up, if any (the “Cash Interest Rate”). PIK Interest (as defined below) on the Notes will accrue at
the Cash Interest Rate plus 0.75% per annum. If the Issuer pays eligible interest in PIK Interest, it will
increase the principal amount of the Notes or issue Additional Notes. Upon the payment of PIK
Interest, a notice shall be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in the form of
Appendix 1. Interest on the Notes will be payable in the currency in which such Notes are
denominated semi-annually in arrears on [] and [], commencing on

[], 2023. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record (i) on the
Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date, in the case of Global
Notes, and (ii) on [] and [] immediately preceding the applicable
interest payment date, in the case of Definitive Registered Notes.


-----

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding. Interest
shall be payable entirely in cash (“Cash Interest”) for the first two Interest Periods and for the final
Interest Period ending at the Stated Maturity of the Notes. For any other Interest Period, interest
shall be payable entirely in cash, except that, if the Applicable Amount (as defined below) for the
relevant interest payment date:

(i) equals or exceeds 75%, but is less than 100%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that
would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its
option, elect to pay interest on (a) 25% of the then outstanding principal amount of the
Notes by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Notes or by issuing Additional
Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest (“PIK Interest”) and (b) 75% of the then
outstanding principal amount of the Notes as Cash Interest;

(ii) equals or exceeds 50%, but is less than 75%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that
would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its
option, elect to pay interest on (a) 50% of the then outstanding principal amount of the
Notes as PIK Interest and (b) 50% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as
Cash Interest;

(iii) equals or exceeds 25%, but is less than 50%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that
would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its
option, elect to pay interest on (a) 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the
Notes as PIK Interest and (b) 25% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as
Cash Interest; or

(iv) is less than 25% of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on
the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest
on the Notes entirely as PIK Interest.

As used herein, “Applicable Amount” shall be an amount determined by the Issuer as the lower of:

(1) an amount equal to the Average Liquidity, as calculated on the Applicable Amount
Determination Date, less €350 million; and

(2) an amount equal to the Projected Liquidity, as calculated on the Applicable Amount
Determination Date, less €350 million.

The insufficiency or lack of funds available to the Issuer to pay Cash Interest as required by the two
preceding paragraphs shall not permit the Issuer to pay PIK Interest in respect of any Interest Period
and the sole right of the Issuer to elect to pay PIK Interest shall be as (and to the extent) provided in
the two preceding paragraphs.

If interest with respect to an Interest Period is not to be paid entirely in cash, the Issuer shall deliver
an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee (with a copy to each Paying Agent) on or prior to the eighth
Business Day preceding the relevant interest payment date, which Officer’s Certificate shall (i) set
forth in reasonable detail the Issuer’s determination with respect to the clause or clauses permitting
the Issuer to pay PIK Interest (including in reasonable detail the calculation and components of the
Average Liquidity and/or Projected Liquidity, as the case may be) and (ii) state, for the Notes then
outstanding, the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date and the amount
of such interest to be paid as PIK Interest. The Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrars shall rely
conclusively upon such Officer’s Certificate without independent verification. On the same date, the
Issuer shall also deliver a notice (the “PIK Notice”) to the Trustee (copied to the Paying Agents),
which notice shall state the total amount of interest to be paid on the relevant interest payment date
and the amount of such interest to be paid as PIK Interest. The Issuer shall cause such notice to be


-----

delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to direct participants in any Global Note.
For so long as Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will also cause such notice to be posted on the official website
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com). For the avoidance of doubt, interest on the
Notes due on any interest payment date with respect to which an Officer’s Certificate and a notice
are not delivered in accordance with this paragraph must be paid entirely in cash.

To the extent the Issuer is required pursuant to this section to pay Cash Interest for all or any portion
of the interest due on any interest payment date, the Issuer shall, and shall cause each of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to, take all such shareholder, corporate or other actions necessary or
appropriate to permit the making of any dividends or distributions (including by way of loans or
advances) to permit the Issuer to pay such Cash Interest on such interest payment date; provided
that any such shareholder, corporate or other actions would not violate applicable law or cause a
breach of any applicable contract.

If the Issuer pays a portion of the interest on the Notes as Cash Interest and a portion as PIK Interest,
such Cash Interest and PIK Interest shall be paid to Holders of the Notes pro rata in accordance with
their interests. Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Notes as a result of a
payment of PIK Interest, the Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and
after the date of such payment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the payment of accrued interest in connection with any
redemption or repurchase of the Notes as described under “—Optional redemption,” “—Repurchase
_at the option of Holders—Change of Control” and “—Asset Sales,” will be made solely in cash._

We cannot assure you that the Issuer will receive sufficient dividends or distributions from its
Subsidiaries or other investees in order to allow it to make Cash Interest payments on the Notes. The
ability of Schaeffler AG and its Subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to the Issuer is
subject to important restrictions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Risk factors—Risks
_related to the Notes and our Structure—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness_
_of the subsidiaries of the Issuer.”_

No later than 120 days following any interest payment date on which PIK Interest was paid in reliance
on clause (2) of the definition of “Applicable Amount,” the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate, setting forth (i) the sum of (x) the actual average weekly balance of the
aggregate amount of cash and Cash Equivalents of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
(excluding the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes) (the “Actual Cash Balance”) for the same
period for which the Projected Average Cash Balance relating to such interest payment date was
determined and (y) the actual average weekly balance of amounts that were available for drawing
under the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement (and the revolving credit facility of any Credit Facility
that refinances or replaces the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement) (the “Actual Available RCF
**Drawings” and, together with the Actual Cash Balance, the “Actual Liquidity”) for the same period**
for which the Projected Available RCF Drawings relating to such interest payment date were
determined, and (ii) the Excess PIK Interest (as defined below), if any, in each case calculated by the
Issuer. The Trustee and the Paying Agents shall rely conclusively upon such Officer’s Certificate
without independent verification.

The amount of PIK Interest paid on such interest payment date that exceeds the amount of PIK
Interest that the Issuer would have been permitted to pay if the Actual Liquidity had been used in
place of the Projected Liquidity shall constitute “Excess PIK Interest” with respect to such interest
payment date (if the Issuer fails to deliver an Officer’s Certificate as and when required pursuant to
the preceding paragraph, the entire amount of PIK Interest paid on such interest payment date shall
be deemed to be Excess PIK Interest). When the aggregate amount of Excess PIK Interest for such
interest payment date and any Excess PIK Interest for prior interest payment dates (which Excess PIK
Interest has not previously been redeemed pursuant to this paragraph) exceeds €50 million, the


-----

Issuer shall, on the next following interest payment date, mandatorily redeem Notes in an amount
equal to such aggregate Excess PIK Interest at a redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the
date of redemption (a “Mandatory Excess PIK Interest Redemption”). The Issuer shall give not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice of such redemption to the Holders (which notice will be
irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in “—Selection and notice”). The
Issuer shall give the Trustee notice of any redemption at least five Business Days prior to the notice
being given to the Holders.

**_Sustainability Performance Target Step-up Interest_**

For the interest payment period commencing on         , 2026 (the “Step-up Date”) and
thereafter, the interest rate applicable for such periods on the Notes shall increase by 0.25% per
annum (such additional interest payable, the “Step-up Interest”) unless the Issuer has delivered to
the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent(s)) a Sustainability Compliance Certificate on or
prior to the Certification Date, confirming that the Schaeffler Group has achieved the Sustainability
Performance Target for the financial year ending December 31, 2025. For the avoidance of doubt (i)
the interest rate on the Notes shall not increase if the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee (with a copy
to the relevant Paying Agent(s)) a Sustainability Compliance Certificate on or prior to the relevant
Certification Date, confirming that the Schaeffler Group has achieved the Sustainability Performance
Target for the financial year ending December 31, 2025, and (ii) in no event shall the total increase in
the interest rate on the Notes exceed 0.25% per annum. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall rely
conclusively on the Sustainability Compliance Certificate from the Issuer (having the Sustainability
Report of Schaeffler AG attached thereto), and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the
accuracy of the Sustainability Compliance Certificate or the related Sustainability Report, verify the
attainment of the Sustainability Performance Target, or make calculations, investigations or
determinations with respect to the attainment of the Sustainability Performance Target (or the
application of any adjustments thereto). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no liability to
the Issuer, any holder of Notes or any other Person in acting in good faith on any Sustainability
Compliance Certificate and any related Sustainability Report. Promptly upon delivering a
Sustainability Compliance Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall
publish a notice on a website of or designated by the Issuer confirming that the Schaeffler Group has
achieved the relevant Sustainability Performance Target; provided that a failure to make such
publication shall not result in the Issuer being required to pay any Step-up Interest.

“Assurance Letter” means a verification assurance report in the form of a “limited assurance” from
an External Verifier of the performance level for the GHG Emissions set forth in the relevant
Sustainability Report.

“Baseline GHG Emissions” means, subject to the section entitled “—Sustainability Adjustments”
below, the GHG Emissions of the Schaeffler Group for the financial year ended December 31, 2019,
being 1,043,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

“Certification Date” means, in respect of a financial year, May 10 of the immediately following
financial year.

“External Verifier” means an accountancy firm (which may be Schaeffler AG’s auditor),
environmental consultant or other third party diligence provider appointed by Schaeffler AG for the
purpose of reviewing Schaeffler AG’s performance against the Sustainability Performance Target or
Sustainability Performance Level, as the case may be.

“GHG Emissions” means Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions of the Schaeffler Group,
determined in accordance with the Scope 1 and 2 guidance of the GHG Protocol Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard as published by the World Resources Institute and the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development, as amended from time to time, or any generally


-----

accepted standard (in the good faith determination of the Issuer) which replaces the GHG Protocol
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

“Sustainability Compliance Certificate” means an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer which shall (i)
confirm whether the Sustainability Performance Target or the Sustainability Performance Level, as
the case may be, for the relevant financial year has been met (i.e. the GHG Emissions are lesser than
or equal to the Sustainability Performance Target or the Sustainability Performance Level, as the case
may be, for that financial year), (ii) attach the relevant Sustainability Report and Assurance Letter, (iii)
to the extent not included in the Sustainability Report, include sufficient information so as to allow a
reasonable determination to be made as to whether or not the Sustainability Performance Target or
the Sustainability Performance Level, as the case may be, for that financial year has been achieved
and (iv) to the extent not included in the Sustainability Report, and if applicable, confirm whether any
adjustments have been made to the Baseline GHG Emission levels, any Sustainability Performance
Target or any Sustainability Performance Level.

“Sustainability Performance Target” means, subject to the section entitled “—Sustainability
_Adjustments” below, in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2025, the Baseline GHG_
Emissions reduced by 75.0% or more.

“Sustainability Report” means, with respect to the financial year ended December 31, 2025 or, in
connection with a redemption of Notes, the financial year referred to in the definition of
“Sustainability Compliance Event,” a sustainability report of Schaeffler AG which shall include GHG
Emissions verified by an External Verifier pursuant to an Assurance Letter (which may be included in
the Sustainability Report or in another document). For the avoidance of doubt, a Sustainability
Report may be a standalone report, be part of Schaeffler AG’s annual report or included in another
document of Schaeffler AG.

_Sustainability Adjustments_

In the event of any change (i) to the calculation methodology of GHG Emissions (including any change
to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard), (ii) in data due to better data
accessibility, or (iii) in the Schaeffler Group’s perimeter (due to an acquisition, a merger, a disposal or
an investment), which, individually or in aggregate, has an impact on the levels of the GHG Emissions
of 5% or more (as determined in good faith by the Issuer), the Issuer may, at its election, revise the
Baseline GHG Emissions, the Sustainability Performance Target applicable to the Notes and/or the
Sustainability Performance Levels in respect of each such change to reflect such change; provided
that, in the Issuer’s good faith determination, such revision is (1) consistent with Schaeffler Group’s
strategy; and (2) in line with the initial level of ambition of, or more ambitious than, the Sustainability
Performance Target applicable to the Notes. The revised Sustainability Performance Target(s) and/or
Sustainability Performance Levels shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer to the
Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent(s)) (the “Recalculation Notice”) and, as from the
date of delivery of the Recalculation Notice, the revised Baseline GHG Emissions, Sustainability
Performance Target(s) and/or Sustainability Performance Levels shall replace previous the Baseline
GHG Emissions, Sustainability Performance Target(s) and/or Sustainability Performance Levels, and
any reference to the Baseline GHG Emissions, the Sustainability Performance Target(s) and/or the
Sustainability Performance Levels in the Indenture thereafter will be deemed to be a reference to
such revised Baseline GHG Emissions, the Sustainability Performance Target(s) and/or the
Sustainability Performance Levels. The Trustee and the Paying Agents shall rely conclusively on any
Recalculation Notice from the Issuer, and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the
accuracy of the Recalculation Notice, verify the revised Baseline GHG Emissions, Sustainability
Performance Target(s) and/or the Sustainability Performance Levels, or make calculations,
investigations or determinations with respect to the revised Baseline GHG Emissions, Sustainability
Performance Target(s) and/or the Sustainability Performance Levels. Promptly after delivery of the
Recalculation Notice to the Trustee, the Issuer shall publish any changes to the Baseline GHG


-----

Emissions, the Sustainability Performance Target(s) and/or the Sustainability Performance Levels, as
the case may be, on a website of or designated by the Issuer.

In case of a change described in clause (iii) of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph due to an
acquisition, a merger or an investment, the Issuer may, at its election and instead of revising the
Baseline GHG Emissions, the Sustainability Performance Target(s) and/or the Sustainability
Performance Levels with respect to such change, exclude from each determination of the GHG
Emissions in respect of the financial year during which such change occurs (and each subsequent
financial year), the impact of such change, in which case the impact of such transaction shall be
excluded from each such determination of the GHG Emissions made under the Indenture.

**_Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined
below) will be payable at the corporate trust office or agency of one or more Paying Agents, except
that payments on the Global Notes will be made to the common depositary whose nominee is the
registered holder of the Global Notes.

Principal, premium, if any, Cash Interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any definitive registered
Notes in certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or
agency of one or more Paying Agents. In addition, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest
may be made by check mailed to the address of the Holders as such address appears in the Note
register. Interest, if payable in the form of Additional Notes, on any Definitive Registered Notes will
be payable by the Issuer delivering to the Trustee and Paying Agent such Additional Notes in the
relevant amount as Definitive Registered Notes and an order to authenticate such notes. See “—
_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”_

PIK Interest on the Notes will be payable (x) with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global
Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable on
the relevant record date, by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Global Note by an
amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable Interest Period (rounded up to the
nearest €1.00) (a “PIK Payment”) and (y) with respect to Notes represented by Definitive Registered
Notes, by issuing Additional Notes (“Additional **PIK Notes”) in certificated form in an aggregate**
principal amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable period (rounded up to the
nearest €1.00), and the Trustee or its authenticating agent will, at the request of the Issuer,
authenticate and deliver such Additional PIK Notes in certificated form for original issuance to the
Holders on the relevant record date, as shown by the records of the register of Holders. Following an
increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, the
Global Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such
PIK Payment. Any Additional PIK Notes issued in certificated form will be dated as of the applicable
interest payment date and will bear interest from and after such date. The Additional PIK Notes will
be governed by, and subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of, the Indenture and shall have
the same rights and benefits as the Notes issued on the Issue Date. Any certificated Additional PIK
Notes will be issued with the description “PIK” on the face of such Additional PIK Note. Unless the
context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the
Notes and any Additional PIK Notes that are actually issued.

The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes to Persons who are registered holders at the close of
business on the record date immediately preceding the interest payment date for such interest. Such
holders must surrender their Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on the Notes will be
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the
Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business


-----

Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

### Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes 

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (collectively with any other paying agents, the
“Paying Agent”) for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars for the Notes (each, a “Registrar”) for so long as
the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require. The initial Registrar
will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Issuer will also maintain one or more transfer agents for
the Notes (each a “Transfer Agent”). The initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register (the “Register”) reflecting ownership of Definitive
Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will facilitate transfer of Definitive
Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer and a copy of the Register will be sent to the Issuer on the
Issue Date and after any change to the Register made by the Registrar, with such copy to be held by
the Issuer at its registered office. In case of discrepancies between the Register and the register held
by the Issuer at its registered office, the latter will prevail for purposes of Luxembourg law. See
“Book-entry, Delivery and Form.” The Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent without prior notice to the
Holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, are
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.luxse.com).

### Transfer and exchange 

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form, without interest
coupons, as follows:

- Notes sold to U.S. persons and within the United States, in each case, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global
**Notes”), which will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the**
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and
Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”).

- Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Note, the “Global Notes”), which will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject
to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more
fully under “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants
in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in a 144A Global Note, or the “Restricted Book-Entry Interest,” may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S
Global Note, or the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests,” only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interest may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transfer of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in
a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
law of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs
will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Notes from which it was
transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Notes to which it was transferred.
Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and
other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
For a more detailed description, please see “Book-entry, Delivery and Form.”

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. Additional
PIK Notes in the form of Definitive Registered Notes issued from time to time in payment of accrued
interest or Additional Amounts may be issued in minimum denominations of €1 (rounded to the
nearest whole integer). It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set
forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be
subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and
described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of
Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will
require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents to the Registrar, furnish information regarding the account of
the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and
opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection
with such transfer or exchange; provided that if the Issuer is a party to the transfer or exchange, the
Holder will not be required to pay such Taxes.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

### Additional Amounts 

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the
Guarantors under or with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account
of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any
Guarantor (including any successor Person to the Issuer or such Guarantor) is then incorporated or
organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any
political subdivision thereof or therein or any jurisdiction of the Paying Agent or any political
subdivision thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of
the Guarantors with respect to any Note Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of
principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by the holders of the Notes after such withholding,
deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such
additional amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of
such payments in the absence of such withholding, deduction or imposition (the “Additional
**Amounts”); provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:**

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of
any present or former connection between the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor
of a power over, the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, trust, nominee,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction
(including being or having been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having
been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent
establishment therein), but excluding any connection arising merely from the acquisition and
holding of such Note, the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note
Guarantee or the receipt of any payments under or in respect of such Note or a Note
Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note
for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment
to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(4) any Taxes withheld within the context of the Luxembourg law of 23 December 2005, as
amended;


-----

(5) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with
respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(6) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes would not be imposed or withheld but for the failure of
the Holder or beneficial owner of Notes (including, for these purposes, any financial
institution through which the Holder or beneficial owner holds the Notes or through which
payment on the Notes is made), following a written request by or on behalf of the Issuer or a
Guarantor or a Paying Agent addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner (and made at a
time that would enable the Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that
request, and in any event, at least 30 days before any withholding or deduction would be
required), to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirement whether required by statute, treaty, regulation, official guidance or
administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, that is a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not
resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification, information or documentation;

(7) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and
Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem
_Steuerwettbewerb), as amended from time to time;_

(8) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes would not be imposed or withheld but for the application
of sections 1471 through 1474 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, including any current or
future Treasury regulations, other official interpretations thereunder, or any law
implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto (“FATCA”);

(9) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer to the Holder if such
Holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of
such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had
such Holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note; or

(10) any combination of items (1) through (9) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and any Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the Holder for
any taxes, charges or similar levies which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery,
issuance, registration, enforcement or transfer (other than a transfer of the Notes after the Offering)
of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document referred to therein,
and any taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection
with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the
Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer
or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating
the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The
Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information necessary to enable the Paying Agents
to pay such Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date. The Issuer and the relevant
Guarantor will provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
evidencing the payment of Additional Amounts. The Trustee shall be entitled to, and shall, rely solely
on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.


-----

If the Issuer is required to pay any Additional Amounts due on any payment of Cash Interest, such
Additional Amounts shall be paid in cash to the extent that the Issuer would be required to pay Cash
Interest as described above under “—Interest.” In other cases, such Additional Amounts may be paid,
at the Issuer’s option, in the form of cash or Additional PIK Notes as may be appropriate so that the
net amount paid after the applicable withholding or deduction is the same as it would have been
without such withholding.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and
will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with
applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax
receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to a holder upon written request, within 60 days after
the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts
evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such
entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably
satisfactory to the holder) by such entity. To the extent that the Issuer is required by law or by the
interpretation or administration thereof to make any deduction or withholding from any payment of
interest on the Notes or any payment of Additional Amounts which, in either case, is made through
the issuance of Additional PIK Notes, the foregoing provisions shall apply with respect to such
withholding or deduction requirement, mutatis mutandis.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context,
the payment of amounts of principal, interest or any other amount payable under, or with respect to,
any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the
payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or
would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any
jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated,
engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from
or through which such Person, Issuer or Guarantor makes any payment under or with respect to the
Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

### Security

**_General_**

The Notes will be secured by the Collateral as described below. The Collateral will initially include the
following properties and assets:

(1) pledges over 333,000,001 shares of Capital Stock of Schaeffler AG (representing
approximately 50% plus one share of Schaeffler AG’s total Capital Stock and approximately
66.6% of Schaeffler AG’s Voting Stock as of the date of this Offering Memorandum);

(2) pledges over 48,742,194 common shares in Continental held by the Issuer (representing
approximately 24.4% of Continental AG’s total Capital Stock as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum); and

(3) pledges over 9,748,439 common shares in Vitesco held by the Issuer (representing
approximately 24.4% of Vitesco’s total Capital Stock as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum).

Any additional assets that may in the future be pledged to secure Obligations under the Notes, any
Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute Collateral.


-----

The obligations under the Notes, the Existing Issuer Notes (including the Redeemed Issuer Notes until
their redemption), the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and any
future Indebtedness that is permitted under the Indenture to share the Collateral (including any
Additional PIK Notes and any additional notes issued as PIK interest in respect of the Existing Issuer
Notes) will be secured effectively equally and ratably by liens over the Collateral. While the pledges
on the Collateral securing the Notes will be created later in time than the pledges securing the
existing Indebtedness secured by the Collateral and are therefore lower-ranking in rem, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that any proceeds received from enforcement of the security
documents will be shared equally and ratably between the holders of the Notes and any other
indebtedness that is or becomes subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Indenture, the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, if any, will be permitted to maintain additional Permitted
Collateral Liens, and in connection therewith will be permitted to incur certain additional
Indebtedness and other liabilities in the future which may share in the Collateral. The amount of such
Permitted Collateral Liens will be limited by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain
_covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The_
amount of such additional Indebtedness secured by the Collateral could be significant.

The Security Documents have been or will be entered into by, among others, as the case may be, the
Security Trustee or its nominee(s), who will act as security trustee with respect to the Collateral for
the Trustee and the Holders, for the lenders under the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement, for the
hedge counterparties under certain hedging obligations and for the holders of any other
Indebtedness that is permitted to share in the Collateral.

The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to
the Holders. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the Offering of the
Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of
time, or at all. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will be required to share recovery
proceeds with other Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), have certain
limitations on their ability to enforce the Security Documents and have agreed that the Collateral
may be released in certain circumstances without their consent.

Each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Trustee to enter into the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each Holder, by accepting a Note, appoints the
Trustee or the Security Trustee, as the case may be, as its trustee or agent under the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and authorizes it to act as such.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer will be entitled to exercise any and all
voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating
dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights
issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in
respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral.

**_Security Documents_**

The Issuer and the Security Trustee have entered or will enter into Security Documents defining the
terms of the Liens that secure the Notes and the other secured obligations that will be secured by the
Collateral. Subject to the terms of, and limitations under, the Security Documents, these Liens will
secure the payment and performance when due of all of the payment obligations of the Issuer and
any Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantees and the Security Documents.
The terms of any Security Documents applicable to Collateral that may be provided in the future by
Persons other than the Issuer will contain certain limitations on the enforcement to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,


-----

fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the relevant security grantors and
their respective shareholders, directors and general partners.

In Germany, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders will not be directly secured by the Security
Documents, but through the parallel debt claim acknowledged by the Issuer by way of an
independent acknowledgement of Indebtedness to the Security Trustee in the Intercreditor
Agreement that is equal to the total amounts payable under the Indenture and the Notes. Please see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**_Enforcement of security_**

Neither the Holders nor the Trustee are a party to the Security Documents. Therefore, neither the
Trustee nor the Holders may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights
in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only take action through the Security
Trustee, and the Collateral generally will only be enforced upon the relevant Security Trustee taking
enforcement action. The Security Trustee will only take enforcement action if an enforcement
decision is taken under the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders will be entitled to vote on such decisions. However, the Security Trustee will take an
enforcement action only if a majority of votes cast by Secured Creditors entitled to vote under the
Intercreditor Agreement is in favor of such action.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Trustee will take an enforcement action with
respect to any of the Collateral only upon the instruction of the Instructing Group (as defined below).
Any decision, instruction or consent requiring action by the Instructing Group under the Intercreditor
Agreement, including decisions and instructions with respect to the enforcement of the Collateral, will
be made in the form of a resolution in the following manner:

Holders (as well as holders of the Existing Issuer Notes and of any notes or similar debt
instruments issued by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries in the future that are secured by the
Collateral and are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) will be entitled to vote on the
resolution, with series of notes denominated in different currencies each voting separately as a
class. The Indenture will provide that, within each voting class, abstentions will be deemed to
have voted either in favor of or against the resolution on a pro rata basis in the same proportion
as the aggregate principal amount with respect to which votes were actually cast in favor of the
resolution and against the resolution, respectively, bears to the total principal amount with
respect to which votes were actually cast. The Trustee (and the trustee for the Existing Issuer
Notes and any trustee for any notes issued in the future that become subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement) will report to the Security Trustee the aggregate principal amount of notes of each
currency that voted (or are deemed under the relevant indenture to have voted) in favor of the
resolution and the aggregate principal amount of notes of each currency that voted (or are
deemed under the relevant indenture to have voted) against the resolution.

Lenders under the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement (and under future facilities agreements
that become subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) will be entitled to vote on the resolution in
accordance with the provisions of the relevant facilities agreement. The facility agent under the
relevant facilities agreement will report to the Security Trustee the aggregate amount of
commitments under the respective facilities agreement that voted (or are deemed under the
relevant facilities agreement to have voted) in favor of the resolution and the aggregate amount
of commitments that voted (or are deemed under the relevant facilities agreement to have voted)
against the resolution.


-----

The Security Trustee will determine the euro-equivalent total principal amount of notes and
amount of commitments under the facilities agreements that voted (or are deemed to have
voted) in favor of and against the resolution.

The resolution will be passed if the total principal amount of notes and amount of commitments
under the facilities agreements that voted (or are deemed to have voted) in favor of the
resolution exceeds the total principal amount of notes and amount of commitments under
facilities agreements that voted (or are deemed to have voted) against the resolution, in each
case on a euro-equivalent basis.

The Intercreditor Agreement refers to any resolution passed in the foregoing manner as a decision or
resolution of the “Instructing Group” (the “Instructing Group”).

Holders may need to rely on other secured creditors, whose interests may differ from those of the
Holders, to direct the Security Trustee to take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral. For
a description of security enforcement and other intercreditor provisions, please see “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Issuer—Issuer Security Pooling and Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

The Security Trustee will agree to any release of the Liens created by the Security Documents that is
in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of
the Holders or the Trustee.

**_Release_**

The Liens created by the relevant Security Documents will be unconditionally released under any one
or more of the following circumstances and as follows:

(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such
property or assets (for the avoidance of doubt, whether directly or through the disposition of
a Person holding such property or assets or of a parent thereof) to (a) a Person that is not
(either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not otherwise violate
the covenant described under the caption entitled “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—
_Asset Sales” or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be_
relied upon in case of a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such
property or assets to a Restricted Subsidiary unless the relevant property or asset remains
subject to, or otherwise becomes subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition;

(2) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions set forth under “Certain covenants—Designation
_of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Members of Issuer Group and OpCo Group,”_
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the
Indenture and the Notes;

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and discharge;”

(5) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) substantially concurrently with or following the release, discharge or other termination
(other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens (other than Permitted


-----

Liens) over the relevant Collateral securing Indebtedness other than Indebtedness under the
Notes and any Notes Guarantees (including in connection with any Restricted Schaeffler
Shares, Restricted Continental Shares, Restricted Vitesco Shares or Restricted Shares
becoming Unrestricted Shares, as the case may be), so long as no Event of Default exists at
such time or would arise as a result of such release;

(7) in connection with the sale or disposal of subscription rights for shares of Capital Stock of any
Person in the course of an Opération Blanche, the release of such subscription rights;
provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

(8) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation
_or Sale of Assets”; or_

(9) as described under “—Amendment, supplement and waiver.”

In addition, the Liens created by the Security Documents will be released as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

Subject to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all
conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such release have been complied with,
the Security Trustee and the Trustee will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release
of Collateral securing the Notes and any Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Trustee
without the consent of the Holder or any action on the part of the Trustee.

### Intercreditor Agreement; Turnover 

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement, as described under
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Indebtedness of the Issuer—Issuer Security Pooling and
_Intercreditor Agreement.” The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding_
the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and any Note Guarantees.

The Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will contain
provisions providing that, if at any time prior to the Senior Discharge Date (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) a payment or distribution is made to the Trustee or to the holders of Notes
that, due to the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement should not have been made to them, subject to certain knowledge
exceptions, the Trustee or the holders of Notes are required to hold it in trust for the Security
Trustee and pay the payment or distribution over to the Security Trustee for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

### Optional redemption

Except as set forth below and except pursuant to “—Redemption for changes in taxes,” the Notes will
not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option prior to [], 2025.

At any time prior to [], 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture, upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to Holders, at a redemption price equal to [] % of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption (subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant
record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds of
an Equity Offering of (i) Schaeffler AG or the Issuer; or (ii) any Parent Entity to the extent the


-----

proceeds from such Equity Offering are contributed to the Issuer’s common equity capital (other
than through the issuance of Redeemable Capital Stock) or are paid to the Issuer as consideration for
the issuance of ordinary shares of the Issuer or are loaned to the Issuer as Subordinated Shareholder
Debt; provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the
Indenture on the Issue Date (excluding Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately
after the occurrence of such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 120 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, at any time prior to [], 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions
redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable
Premium as of the date of redemption, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

On or after [], 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of
the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed
as percentages of principal amount) set forth (i) in column A below, in case the Sustainability
Compliance Event has occurred or (ii) in column B below, in case a Sustainability Compliance Event
has not occurred, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve month
period beginning on [] of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of the
Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

**Notes**

2028 and thereafter ................................................................................. 100.0000% 100.0000%

**_General_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any Notes in compliance with
the terms of the Indenture, including a Change of Control Offer, a Notes Offer or an Asset Sale Offer,
if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making
such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders will be deemed to have consented to such tender offer,
and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ prior written notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration
date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase, at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes (excluding any early
tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding,
such redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). In determining whether the Holders of
at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered
and not withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes, Notes
owned by any affiliate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such


-----

tender offer or other offer, as applicable. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the
requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or
regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with any such
tender offer.

Notice of any redemption of Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of
a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an
Asset Sale or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one
or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If
such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such
notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days
after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have
been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or
by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time
in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be
satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the
redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture,
and, subject to the requirements of the relevant clearing system, a single notice of redemption may
be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice
may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have the same or different
redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date
will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of the relevant clearing
system, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to
redemption by the Issuer. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest
will cease to accrue on the respective Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the
applicable redemption date.

### Redemption for changes in taxes

The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable
and given in accordance with the procedures described in “—Selection and notice”), at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all
Additional Amounts (if any) then due or which will become due by the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect
thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the
Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts or a Guarantor would be unable for reasons
outside its control to procure payment by the Issuer (or by another Guarantor that would be able to
make the relevant payment without paying Additional Amounts) and in making payment itself the
relevant Guarantor would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer or the relevant


-----

Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures
available, and the requirement to pay such Additional Amounts arises as a result of:

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, treaties or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this Offering
Memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after
the date of this Offering Memorandum, such later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such
laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which
amendment or change has not been publicly announced before and which becomes effective
on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction
became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such later
date) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”).

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date
on which the Issuer or a Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or
withholding if a payment in respect of the relevant Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or,
where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that there has been such
Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before
the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot
be avoided by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of
counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as
described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

### Mandatory redemption 

Except for any Mandatory Excess PIK Interest Redemption as set forth under “—Interest,” the Issuer
is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

### Repurchase at the option of Holders 

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase all or any part (in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1 in excess
thereof) of that holder’s Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the
Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the “Change of
**Control Payment”), subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest**
due on the relevant interest payment date.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each Holder at such
Holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and
offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the


-----

notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice
is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other applicable securities laws and regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are
then listed) to the extent those laws and regulations (or exchange rules) are applicable in connection
with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a
repurchase of the Notes, under the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agents an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an
Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes
being purchased by the Issuer.

The Paying Agents will as soon as reasonably practicable mail (or cause to be delivered) to each
Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee
(or its authenticating agent) will as soon as reasonably practicable authenticate and mail (or cause to
be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of
the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are
applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes
in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change
of Control Offer; or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described
above under the caption “—Optional redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of
the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the
consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer may be limited
by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control
would constitute a change of control under the Issuer’s and the Schaeffler OpCo Group’s other
indebtedness, including the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement, the Schaeffler Group Facilities
Agreements, the Existing Issuer Notes and the Schaeffler Group Existing Notes, which would require a
mandatory prepayment or offer to repurchase such indebtedness. In addition, certain events that
may constitute a change of control under such other indebtedness and require a mandatory
prepayment or offer to purchase such indebtedness may not constitute a Change of Control under
the Indenture. Future indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also require such


-----

indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. The ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the
Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may also be limited by the Issuer’s and the
Restricted Subsidiaries’ then existing financial resources, and sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available
at the Issuer’s Subsidiaries or at Continental AG, Vitesco or their respective subsidiaries, the boards
of directors of Schaeffler AG, Continental AG and/or Vitesco may not declare the requisite dividends
or distributions to pay such funds to the Issuer Group, the other shareholders of Continental AG
and/or Vitesco AG may fail to approve any such dividend or distribution by Continental AG and/or
Vitesco AG to the Issuer Group, and the terms of indebtedness of the Schaeffler OpCo Group,
Continental AG, Vitesco AG or their respective subsidiaries may prohibit the upstreaming of funds to
the Issuer Group necessary to repurchase or repay the Notes upon a Change of Control. Accordingly,
the Issuer expects that it would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes upon a Change of Control, and the Issuer cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain
such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer or consummate an offer to purchase Notes would
constitute a Default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the Issuer
Revolving Facility Agreement. Please see “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes and our Structure—
_Although the occurrence of specific change of control events will permit Note Holders to require_
_repurchase of the Notes, the Issuer may not be able to repurchase such Notes.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as
to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as
to whether a Change of Control has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith
judgment of the Issuer.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute
a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the_
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions
that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of
Control.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, are
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer will post a public announcement with respect to the results of any
Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).


-----

**_Asset Sales_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Issuer (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity
Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of (such Fair Market Value to be determined
on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); and

(2) other than with respect to a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% (or, in case of a Restricted
Asset Sale, 90%) of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary consists of:

(a) cash, Cash Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments or Investment Grade Securities;

(b) the assumption by the transferee of any such assets (or the cancellation or discharge
of) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or, in case of a Restricted Asset Sale, the Issuer or
any Guarantor) (or, if incurred since the date of the latest balance sheet, that would
be recorded on the next balance sheet or the notes thereto) (other than
Subordinated Debt), as a result of which the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (or,
in case of a Restricted Asset Sale, the Issuer or any Guarantor) are no longer
obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;

(c) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the
Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash, Cash Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments
or Investment Grade Securities received in that conversion;

(d) in any Asset Sale other than a Restricted Asset Sale, any Capital Stock or assets of the
kind referred to in clauses (1)(d), (e) or (f) of the next paragraph of this covenant;

(e) in any Asset Sale other than a Restricted Asset Sale, Indebtedness of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to
the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together
with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant
that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) € 500 million and (ii)
5.0% of Total Assets, at the time of receipt of such Designated Non-Cash
Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value),

_provided that, in case of the issuance, sale or other disposal of assets or Equity Interests upon and in_
connection with the exercise of exchange or conversion rights under Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is exchangeable or convertible into such assets or Equity
Interests, (i) for purposes of this Asset Sale covenant (but not for purposes of clause (1) of the first


-----

paragraph under “—Security—Release”) such issuance, sale or other disposal shall be deemed to
occur at the time of incurrence of such exchangeable or convertible Indebtedness by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) the consideration received for such assets or Equity Interests
issued or sold or otherwise disposed of shall be deemed to be the proceeds received by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of the incurrence of such exchangeable or convertible
Indebtedness and (iii) for purposes of clause (1) above, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to have received consideration at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets
or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of, if the Fair Market Value of the proceeds
referred to in the foregoing clause (ii) are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of such
exchangeable or convertible Indebtedness.

Within 365 days (or, in the case of a Restricted Asset Sale, within 180 days) after the receipt of any
Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be) may:

(1) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary):

(a) to (i) purchase Notes in an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price at least
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (a “Notes Offer”), (ii) redeem
Notes if the Notes are then redeemable as provided under “—Optional Redemption”
or (iii) purchase Notes through open market purchases or in privately negotiated
transactions at market prices (which may be below par);

(b) to prepay or repay Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor under a
Credit Facility or to pay any Hedging Obligations, in each case, that are secured by a
Permitted Collateral Lien that ranks equal to or in priority to any Lien on such assets
securing the Notes or any Note Guarantees and, if the Indebtedness repaid is
revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect
thereto;

(c) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay (i) any Indebtedness that is
secured by a Lien on assets or property of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
which do not constitute Collateral, or (ii) any Indebtedness (x) of a Restricted
Subsidiary (not owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary) that is not a
Guarantor or (y) of any member of the Schaeffler OpCo Group (not owed to another
member of the Schaeffler OpCo Group), and, in each case, if the Indebtedness repaid
is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with
respect thereto;

(d) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another
Permitted Business (or any business that is not, in whole or in part, a Permitted
Business, if the business, or the part thereof that is not a Permitted Business, is not
material to the Issuer, its Restricted Subsidiaries and Schaeffler OpCo Group taken as
a whole), if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, such business
is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(e) to make a capital expenditure;

(f) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets
under IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

(g) any combination of the foregoing; or

(2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clause (d), (e) or
(f) of paragraph (1) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a
permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the


-----

earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the
180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period,

_provided that the Net Proceeds from any Restricted Asset Sale may only be applied in accordance_
with clause (1)(a) or (b) of this paragraph (or any combination thereof).

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary)
may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any
manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the
Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the
extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law
(including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of
the relevant directors) or (y) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the Net Proceeds from an
Asset Sale by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to
comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the
Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be
applied in compliance with this covenant.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second
paragraph of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” Within ten Business Days from the
365th day (or, in case of a Restricted Asset Sale, from the 180th day) after the later of an Asset Sale
and the receipt of such Net Proceeds, or at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €75 million and has not been committed in accordance with
clause (2) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale
**Offer”) to all holders of Notes and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other Pari Passu**
Indebtedness, to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and such
other Pari Passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all
fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) to which the Asset Sale
Offer applies that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer
price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to no less than 100% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase,
prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess
Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be
prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds or if the aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the
amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Trustee or the applicable Registrar will select the Notes
and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable (to the extent the Trustee or Registrar is the
relevant agent of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness), to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the
manner described under “—Selection and notice”), based on the amounts tendered or required to be
prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will
be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the
net amount of funds in euro that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of
the Net Proceeds into euro.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations (or the rules of any exchange on
which the Notes are then listed) to the extent those laws and regulations (or exchange rules) are


-----

applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, an Asset
Sale Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or
exchange rules) conflict with the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules)
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of the Notes, under
the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

### Selection and notice

Notices of redemption may be made subject to conditions precedent.

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the applicable
Registrar will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global
form as discussed under “—Book-entry, Delivery and Form,” based on a method that most nearly
approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee or the applicable Registrar deems fair and
appropriate in accordance with Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s procedures), unless otherwise required
by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements. Neither the Trustee nor the
applicable Registrars shall be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

Except in the case of a Mandatory Excess PIK Interest Redemption, no Notes of €100,000 or less can
be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1 will be redeemed. In case of a
Mandatory Excess PIK Interest Redemption, only Notes of €1 will be redeemed. Notices of
redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each Holder to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption
notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will
state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of
the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note. In case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation
will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of
Notes called for redemption.

For Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices
may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to
entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market
and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the
holders of the relevant Notes shall also be posted by the Issuer on the official website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com) and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer
will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the notice requirements in the Indenture will be
subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, for so
long as the Notes are held as Global Notes. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of
Euroclear or Clearstream conflict with any requirements applicable to notices under the Indenture, a
notice will be deemed to satisfy such requirements if it complies with the mandatory rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, concerning the content, timing and
procedure for delivering notices and otherwise complies with any applicable requirements under the
Indenture.


-----

### Certain covenants

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

Subject to the exceptions set forth below, the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, “incur”)
any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt); provided that (i) any member of the Issuer Group may
incur Indebtedness if, on the date of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, after giving effect to the
incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom, on a pro forma
basis, as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four quarter
period, (x) the Combined Coverage Ratio would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 and (y) the Issuer Group LTV
Ratio would be less than 1.0 to 2.5, and (ii) any member of a Restricted OpCo Group may incur
Indebtedness if, on the date of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, after giving effect to the
incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom, on a pro forma
basis, as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four quarter
period, the Combined Coverage Ratio would be at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries of any of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under Credit Facilities in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed an amount equal to the greater
of €1,500 million and 9.5% of Total Assets, plus, in the case of any refinancing of any
Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount
of all fees, underwriting discounts, premiums, accrued and unpaid interest and other costs
and expenses in connection with such refinancing;

(2) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or Indebtedness of any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries owing to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; provided
that: (a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the lender is
not the Issuer or any Guarantor ((i) except in respect of intercompany current liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with cash management, cash
pooling or foreign exchange, working capital or tax management of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the extent legally permitted), such Indebtedness must
be unsecured and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
Obligations then due with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer or the respective
Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and (b)(i) any disposition or transfer of any such

provide all or any portion of the funds used to consummate the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries); provided,
however, with respect to this clause (13), that at the time of the acquisition or other
transaction pursuant to which such Indebtedness was deemed to be incurred (x) the Issuer
would have been able to incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (i)(x) of
the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such

applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in
each case, so long as the incurrence of such Indebtedness is not prohibited under the terms
of the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with the first two paragraphs of this covenant, in the event
that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of clauses (1) through (14) of the
second paragraph of this covenant, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to divide and classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of
its incurrence in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided that Indebtedness under the
Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date (after giving pro forma effect to
the Refinancing) will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception
provided by clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified pursuant
to the next following sentence. In addition, any item of Indebtedness initially classified as incurred
pursuant to one or more of clauses (1) through (14) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or
entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, may later be reclassified by
the Issuer such that it will be deemed as having been incurred pursuant to such other clause of the
second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant to the extent
that such reclassified Indebtedness could be incurred pursuant to such other clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant or the first paragraph of this covenant at the time of such reclassification.


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with the first two paragraphs of this covenant,
notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred
to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Total Assets, if such refinancing would cause the
percentage of Total Assets restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Total
Assets on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Total Assets restriction shall not be
deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and/or capitalized
interest, accreted value or original issue discount and any fees, costs and expenses, including
premiums, defeasance costs, indemnity fees, upfront fees and any required additional tax gross-up
amounts, in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this “Limitation on
_Indebtedness” covenant, obligations with respect to letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each_
case supporting Indebtedness otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will
not be included. If obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to
the first or second paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included.
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness (including in respect of the Notes), the payment of dividends in the form of additional
shares of preferred stock or Redeemable Capital Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an
incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance
with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of
amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or “clean down” provision or any similar
provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid
periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been incurred on the
date such Indebtedness was first incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing
thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was incurred (in the case of term Indebtedness) or first committed or first incurred,
whichever yields the lower euro equivalent (in case of revolving credit Indebtedness); provided that
(1) if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other
than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of all fees, underwriting
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses in connection with such refinancing; (2) the euro
equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date will be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (3) if and for
so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against fluctuations
in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated
covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness will be
calculated so as to take account of the effects of such currency agreement.


-----

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. The principal amount
of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate
applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect
on the date of such refinancing.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be (1) in the case of any
Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect thereof
determined in accordance with IFRS and (2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of
any other Indebtedness.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with any merger, acquisition or other Investment where there is a time difference
between commitment and closing or incurrence (including in respect of incurrence of Indebtedness,
Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio
and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date (the “Agreement
**Date”) the definitive agreements for such merger, acquisition or other Investment are entered into**
(or, in case of an acquisition or other Investment in the form of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with which no definitive agreement is entered into with the target company, the date of
such tender or exchange offer) and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to such merger, acquisition or other Investment and the other transactions to be
entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for
purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any
subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such
baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio or any component
thereof (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets or the share price or share
value of any Person) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation
of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted
hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such
transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such
determinations occur at the Agreement Date, any such transactions (including any incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the Agreement
Date and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture
after the Agreement Date and before the consummation, termination or abandonment of such
transaction. The calculation of the Intercreditor Agreement LTV Ratio on a pro forma basis pursuant
to the foregoing sentence may, at the Issuer’s option, also give pro forma effect to the granting of
any Liens over additional assets that will form part of the Collateral on the date of consummation of
the relevant transaction; provided that if not all of such additional assets form part of the Collateral
on the date of consummation of the relevant transaction, the Issuer shall be required to test the
Intercreditor Agreement LTV Ratio at the time of consummation of such transaction or related
transactions (if compliance with the ratio is required in connection with the consummation of such
transactions).


-----

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, make any Restricted Payment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may make a

time of such Restricted Investment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a
consequence of such Restricted Investment;

(2) the Issuer, at the time of such Restricted Investment and after giving pro forma effect thereto
as if such Restricted Investment had been made at the beginning of the applicable fourquarter period, would have been permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness

of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Indebtedness;” and

(3) such Restricted Investment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Investments declared or made under this paragraph after the Issue Date, and after giving

avoidance of doubt, any member of the Schaeffler OpCo Group), and (ii) any other
Investments (including Investments in Continental and Vitesco) other than
Investments in Subsidiaries; plus

(b) 50% of the sum of the aggregate Consolidated Net Income of each Restricted OpCo

Subsidiary and ending on the last day of such entity’s last fiscal quarter ending prior
to the date of such proposed Restricted Investment for which consolidated financial
statements of such entity are available, without double counting of dividends,
distributions or other returns in respect of Investments from such Restricted OpCo
Group TopCo that are taken into account under clause (a) above in respect of the
same period of time (or, if such sum of Consolidated Net Income of the Restricted
OpCo Group TopCos for the relevant period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit);
plus

(c) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the Fair Market Value of property or
assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer since the Issue Date as equity
capital contributions or from the issuance or sale (other than to any Subsidiary of the
Issuer) of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock (including upon the exercise of options,
warrants or rights) or warrants, options or rights to purchase the Issuer’s Qualified
Capital Stock (excluding the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Issuer’s
Qualified Capital Stock financed, directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid) or
from the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than an issuance
or sale to a Subsidiary of the Issuer); plus

(d) (i) the amount by which the Issuer’s Indebtedness or Indebtedness of any
Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the Issuer’s or such Restricted

the conversion or exchange (other than by a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of
such Indebtedness into the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock; and

(ii) without duplication with preceding clause (i), 100% of the aggregate
amount of cash and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or
marketable securities received after the Issue Date by the Issuer from the

Indebtedness or Redeemable Capital Stock that has been converted into
or exchanged for the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock,

together with, in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii), the aggregate net cash proceeds
received by the Issuer at the time of such conversion or exchange (excluding the net
cash proceeds from the issuance of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock financed,
directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

(e) if any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is (a) sold, disposed
of, repurchased, redeemed or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or repaid (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the sale or disposal of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary), 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the Fair Market
Value of the property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than from the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary);

Issuer, 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Investment of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

guarantee made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to any Person (other than
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), an amount equal to the amount of such
guarantee; plus

(f) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the Fair Market Value of the property or
assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than from the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) from the sale of Unrestricted
Continental Shares, Unrestricted Schaeffler Shares or Unrestricted Vitesco Shares;
plus

(g) in the case of the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary
or if an Unrestricted Subsidiary is merged or consolidated into the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to
the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries (as long as the designation of such Subsidiary
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary was deemed a Restricted Investment), the Fair Market
Value of assets received by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary or the Issuer’s
Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such designation or at the time of
such merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, other than to the extent of the
amount of the Investment that constituted a Permitted Investment or was made
under clause (11) of the next succeeding paragraph and will increase the amount
available under the applicable clause of the definition of “Permitted Investment” or
clause (11) of the next succeeding paragraph, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the first two paragraphs above, the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may
take the following actions so long as (with respect to clauses (11) and (12) below only) no Default or
Event of Default of the type specified in clauses (1), (2), (3), (6) or (9) under “—Events of Default and
_Remedies” has occurred and is continuing:_

transactions, shall not exceed the amount of tax that the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would owe without taking into account such other person.

Restricted Payments made subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to clauses (1), (8) (but only to the
extent that Permitted Upstream Payments under clause (8) are not made for the purpose of the
payment of Taxes by a Restricted Person), (11) and (12) of the preceding paragraph (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not pursuant to any other clauses) will reduce the amount that would otherwise
be available for Restricted Investments under clause (3) of the second paragraph of this covenant.

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted
Payment (or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in
clauses (1) through (15) of the second preceding paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant
to the second paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the
definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment
or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on
circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment
(or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment
pursuant to one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction
on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured
by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating


-----

distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and
(y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or
advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other indebtedness incurred by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or
by reason of:

(1) agreements (including Credit Facilities) in effect on the Issue Date, including the Issuer
Revolving Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Existing Issuer Notes and the
indenture governing the Existing Issuer Notes, the security documents relating to the Issuer
Revolving Facility Agreement and the Existing Issuer Notes, in each case as in effect on the
Issue Date, and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that (a) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the amendments, restatements, modifications,
renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more
restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions
than (i) those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith
by the Issuer) or (ii) is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by
the Issuer) or (b) the Issuer determines in good faith that such restrictions will not materially
adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to make required principal and interest payments
on the Notes;

(2) the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to
any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (a) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a
whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case, as in effect on the
Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or (ii) is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or (b) the Issuer determines in good
faith that such restrictions will not materially adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to
make required principal and interest payments on the Notes;

(4) applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any license, authorization, concession
or permit;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or
relating to Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person, entered into on or before the date on
which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or
into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or
on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness incurred
as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such
date;


-----

(6) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered
into in the ordinary course of business;

(7) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and
Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature
described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all
of the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that
Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(9) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the
agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more
restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the
Indebtedness being refinanced (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(10) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described under the
caption “—Limitation on Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets
subject to such Liens;

(11) customary provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint
venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale
agreements and other similar agreements in the ordinary course of business (including
agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitation is
applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;

(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or
required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business;

(15) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant agreements governing Hedging Obligations or Bank
Products;

(17) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews,
refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the
foregoing clauses (1) through (16), or in this clause (17); provided that the terms and
conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material
respect than those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, refinanced or
replaced (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (each, an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of
€40 million and 0.25% of Total Assets, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable
to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could be obtained in a


-----

comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;
and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate consideration in excess of the
greater of €80 million and 0.50% of Total Assets, the terms of the transaction have been
approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in
this clause (2) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested
directors of the Issuer (or, if there is only one disinterested director, by such disinterested
director).

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject
to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant agreement,
employee benefit arrangements with any employee, consultant, officer or director of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation
rights, stock incentive or similar plans;

(2) transactions between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary, or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3) transactions in the ordinary course of business with (i) a Person (other than an Unrestricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer) that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer, directly or
through a Restricted Subsidiary, owns an Equity Interest in, can designate one or more board
members of, or otherwise controls, such Person or (ii) joint ventures (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Continental and Vitesco) or Unrestricted Subsidiaries; provided that, in
the case of the foregoing sub-clause (ii), such transactions are fair to the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as
favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(4) payment of reasonable fees and reimbursements of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) of the Issuer or
Subordinated Shareholder Debt to Affiliates of the Issuer;

(6) any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) or other Restricted Payment, in either
case, that does not violate the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(7) any Permitted Investments (other than Permitted Investments described in clause (a) of the
definition thereof);

(8) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by, any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and
transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so
long as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not more
disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect than the original agreement as in
effect on the Issue Date (as determined by the Issuer in good faith);

(9) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each
case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the


-----

Indenture that are fair to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable
determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior
management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(10) any transactions in the ordinary course of business between the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and any Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because a director of such
Person is also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer; provided
that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Issuer or such direct or indirect
parent, as the case may be, on any matter involving such Person;

(11) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between the Issuer
and any other Person or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer and any other Person with
which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries files a consolidated tax return or with
which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a group for tax purposes or any
tax advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; provided,
_however, that any such tax sharing agreement does not permit or require payments in excess_
of the amounts of tax that would be payable by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a
stand-alone basis;

(12) transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Equity
Interests of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such transaction is with all holders
of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders) and such Affiliates are treated no
more favorably than all other holders of such class generally;

(13) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such
Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with terms of
the Indenture and pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(14) any lease entered into between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any
Affiliate of the Issuer, as lessor, which is approved by a majority of the members of the Board
of Directors of the Issuer;

(15) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing; and

(16) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a letter
from an investment banking or accounting firm of international standing or any third party
appraiser of international standing that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (1)
of the first paragraph of this covenant.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist, any Lien (the “Initial Lien”)
securing Indebtedness, except for Permitted Liens, upon or with respect to any of their property or
assets that do not constitute Collateral, now owned or hereafter acquired, unless all payments due
under the Indenture, the Notes and any Note Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable basis
(or, in the case of Indebtedness which is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Note
Guarantees, on a priority or senior basis, with the same relative priority as the Notes or the Note
Guarantees, as applicable, shall have with respect to such subordinated Indebtedness) with the
obligations so secured.

With respect to the whole or any part of the Collateral, the Issuer will not, and will not cause or
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise
cause or suffer to exist, any Lien securing Indebtedness, except for Permitted Collateral Liens.


-----

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to this covenant will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged (a) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien other
than as a consequence of an enforcement action with respect to the assets subject to such Lien; or
(b) as set forth under the heading “—Security.” Subject to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating
to such release have been complied with, the Security Trustee and the Trustee will take all necessary
action required to effectuate any release of such Liens in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Trustee
without the consent of the Holders.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at
the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any
Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean
any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the
accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the
form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or
liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing
Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Issuer will not, in a single transaction or through a series of related transactions, (i) merge,
amalgamate or consolidate with or into any other Person; or (ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any other Person or Persons unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of related transactions either
(a) the Issuer will be the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
merger, amalgamation or other combination or to which such sale, assignment, conveyance,
transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis has been made (A) is a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or similar entity organized or existing
under the laws of any Permissible Jurisdiction, Switzerland, Norway, the United States of
America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia; and (B) expressly assumes all of the
Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a party (to the extent
such assumption is not effected by operation of law);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default exists;

(3) the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other
than the Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition has been made, would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma
effect thereto and to any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (i) be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Combined Coverage Ratio test set forth in
clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness;” or (ii) the Combined Coverage Ratio would be no less than it was_
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case,
stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any)
comply with this covenant; and that the Notes, the supplemental indenture and the


-----

Indenture constitute the Issuer’s (or persons formed by or surviving any such consolidation
or merger) legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their terms;
provided that in giving such opinion of counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as
to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above.

A Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture) will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another
Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation); or (2) sell, assign, transfer,
lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or a series
of related transactions, to another Person unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, (a) the Guarantor is the surviving Person
or (b) no Default or Event of Default exists and the Person acquiring the property in any such
sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger
assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents to which such Guarantor is a party pursuant to a supplemental indenture and
appropriate accession documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; or

(2) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, if any.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result
of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been incurred in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

This “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to (i) any consolidation or
merger or sale of all or part of the assets of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor with,
into or to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or (ii) any
consolidation or merger or sale of all or part of the assets of any Guarantor with, into or to the Issuer
or another Guarantor. Clauses (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale
_of Assets” covenant will not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the_
assets or merger or consolidation of the Issuer to, with or into any Guarantor, and clause (3) of the
first paragraph of this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to any sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Issuer with
or into an Affiliate for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the
Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Members of Issuer Group and OpCo_**
**_Group_**

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, either (A) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of €1,000 or
less or (B) if such Subsidiary has assets greater than €1,000, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of
the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Investments under the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of
the definition of “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be
permitted if, at the time of designation, (1) the Investment referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence would be permitted; and (2) none of such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries:


-----

(a) has any Indebtedness other than Non-Recourse Debt;

(b) except as permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—
_Transactions with Affiliates,” is party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or_
understanding with the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary unless the terms of any
such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding are no less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that might be obtained at the time
from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Issuer; and

(c) is a Person with respect to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has any
direct or indirect obligation (a) to subscribe for additional Equity Interests; or (b) to
maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or to cause such Person to
achieve any specified levels of operating results.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing promptly with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving
effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with
the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments.”_

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any member of the Schaeffler OpCo Group) to be a Restricted Subsidiary
if such designation would not cause a Default; provided that such designation will be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1)(a) such Indebtedness is
permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
reference period or (b) the Combined Coverage Ratio calculated on a pro forma basis as if such
designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period would be greater than
or equal to such ratio immediately prior to such designation; and (2) no Default or Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation.

Subject to the next succeeding sentence, any Person which, after the Issue Date, becomes a direct
Subsidiary of any member or members of the Issuer Group and any Subsidiary of such Subsidiary
(each such Subsidiary, a “Future Subsidiary”) will, upon becoming such Subsidiary, initially be
deemed to be a member of an OpCo Group. The Issuer may designate any Future Subsidiary
(including in connection with any acquisition or formation of any such Future Subsidiary) to be a
member of the Issuer Group (upon which designation such Subsidiary shall cease to be a member of
an OpCo Group), provided that (1) such Future Subsidiary complies with the covenant described
under the caption “—Limitation on activities;” (2) such Future Subsidiary is not a Subsidiary of any
member of an OpCo Group (unless any such member of such OpCo Group is also designated as a
member of the Issuer Group); and (3) no Default or Event of Default would arise as a result of such
designation.

**_Maintenance of listing_**

The Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market for so long as such
Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain
such listing, it will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain a listing of such Notes on another
recognized stock exchange.


-----

**_Lines of business_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business
other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Limitation on activities_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the
Issuer Group to, engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity, own any assets or
incur any liability except for Holding Company Activities.

**_Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Guarantor), directly or
indirectly, to Guarantee any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor in an amount in
excess of €100 million outstanding under any Credit Facility unless such Restricted Subsidiary
simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for a Guarantee of the
payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu
with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations
or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantees of any Restricted
Subsidiary given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided
profits of not less than €250 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given,
of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s,
in connection with the operation of cash management programs established in the ordinary course of
business for the benefit of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary
to Guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction, (b) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in
the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary
(or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders or the
partners of such partnership) or (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to
any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Guarantee of a Guarantor created pursuant to the
provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not
otherwise violate the covenant described under the caption entitled “—Repurchase at the
_option of Holders—Asset Sales;”_

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor (for the
avoidance of doubt, whether directly or through the disposition of a parent thereof) to a


-----

Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not
otherwise violate the covenant described under the caption entitled “—Repurchase at the
_option of Holders—Asset Sales” and that Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a_
result of the sale or other disposition;

(3) substantially concurrently with or following the release or other termination of any and all
guarantees given by the relevant Guarantor with respect to Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor other than the Notes any Guarantees thereof in an amount in excess of €100.0
million outstanding under any Credit Facility, so long as no Event of Default exists at such
time or would arise as a result of such release;

(4) if the Issuer designates any Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(5) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and discharge;”

(7) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the
Indenture and the Notes;

(8) as described under “—Amendment, supplement and waiver;” or

(9) as described under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.”

The Issuer will be permitted after the Issue Date to cause additional Restricted Subsidiaries to
become Guarantors under the Indenture even if such Restricted Subsidiaries are not required at such
time to become Guarantors pursuant to this covenant (such Guarantors, “Optional Guarantors”). The
Issuer will be entitled to release any such Optional Guarantor from its Note Guarantee obligations
provided (x) no Event of Default would result from such release and (y) such Optional Guarantor is
not at the time of the proposed release otherwise required to be a Guarantor pursuant to this
covenant.

Upon any release of a Note Guarantee contemplated under this covenant, the Trustee or Security
Trustee, as applicable, shall execute any documents required in order to evidence such release,
discharge and termination in respect of such Note Guarantee.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action, which action or omission would have the result of materially
impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that (i) the
incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens” or (ii)
the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for
the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Trustee, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing
in this provision shall restrict the discharge, release or replacement of the Collateral in accordance
with the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, (b) the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens and (c) the Security Documents may be


-----

amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
_provided that, in the case of clause (c), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed,_
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released, unless, contemporaneously
with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or
release, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally
recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification, replacement or release and retaking; or (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors, a
member thereof or the chief financial officer or another responsible Officer of the relevant Person
(acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement,
supplement, modification or release and retaking; or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications),
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or
Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens
not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders, the Security Trustee may from
time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) subject to compliance with the first
paragraph above, provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any
other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the Holders in any material respect.

In the event that the Issuer complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall
(subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

At the request of the Issuer, without the consent of Holders, and at the time of, or prior to, the
incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness (i) that is permitted to be
incurred pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and
either to share in the Collateral or to rank pari passu or junior in right of payment to the Notes or pari
_passu or junior to any Guarantee, or (ii) the proceeds of which are used, in whole or in part, to_
refinance the Notes or Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (i), the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall enter into with the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an Intercreditor Agreement (an “Additional
**Intercreditor Agreement”) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or on**
terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), and substantially similar as applies to sharing of
the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security; provided that
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
any Security Trustee or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or
any Security Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the request of the Issuer, without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Trustee
shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure defects and manifest errors, resolve ambiguities or


-----

reflect changes, in each case, of a minor, technical or administrative nature; (2) increase the amount
or types of Indebtedness covered by any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement that may be incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including the addition of provisions
relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes); (3) add new
guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (4) further
secure the Notes or any Note Guarantee; (5) make provision for the security securing Additional
Notes to rank pari passu with the Collateral or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens;
(6) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with
the terms thereof; or (7) make any other change to any such Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement that does not adversely affect the rights of Holders in any
material respect.

The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or any Security Trustee to enter into any
amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted by the provisions under “—Amendment, supplement and waiver” or
as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to
the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or any Security Trustee under the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or, to the extent applicable, an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee shall be deemed to have consented on behalf of the Holders to any payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

Each Holder shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or
entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have consented to and
directed the Trustee and the Security Trustee to enter into any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
any amendment of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement which
complies with the foregoing provision and the conditions contained therein.

**_Suspension of covenants when Notes rated investment grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have received Investment Grade Status and
(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension
**Event” and the date thereof being referred to as the “Suspension Date”), then, beginning on that day**
and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the covenants specifically listed under
the following captions in this “Description of the Notes” section of this Offering Memorandum will
not be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Asset Sales;”

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness;”

(3) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(4) “—Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(6) clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;”


-----

(7) “—Lines of business;” and

(8) “—Limitation on issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, neither the Issuer nor any
Restricted Subsidiary may designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to
the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

If and while the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants,
the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any
period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the
Notes cease to maintain Investment Grade Status, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will
thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture unless and until the
Notes subsequently again attain Investment Grade Status. The period of time between the
Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this “Description of the Notes” as the
“Suspension Period.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to
be taken by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that (i) with
respect to Restricted Payments made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as
Restricted Investments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension_
Period; (ii) all Indebtedness incurred, or Redeemable Capital Stock issued, during the Suspension
Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (4) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Indebtedness;” (iii) any
Affiliate Transaction entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into
during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (8) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Transactions with Affiliates;” (iv) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in
clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—
_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective_
during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
_Restricted Subsidiaries” and (v) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to comply with the_
covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness”
after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Restricted Subsidiary
during any Suspension Period. In addition, in the event of any such reinstatement, the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, without causing a Default or an Event of Default, to honor
any contractual commitments or take any actions, as long as the contractual commitments were
entered into during the Suspension Period and not in anticipation of the occurrence of a Reversion
Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The
Issuer shall notify the Trustee of the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, although such
notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.


-----

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
in electronic form:

(1) (a) annual reports (x) with respect to Schaeffler AG (for so long as Schaeffler AG is a

(2) (a) quarterly reports (x) with respect to Schaeffler AG (for so long as Schaeffler AG is a

description of the material differences in the financial condition and results of
operations between (i) the Issuer Group, the Schaeffler OpCo Group and any
Restricted OpCo Group on a combined basis and (ii) the Schaeffler OpCo Group and
any Restricted OpCo Groups on a combined basis; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of (a) a Material Transaction; (b) any changes of the chief
executive officer or chief financial officer of the Issuer or in the auditors of the Issuer; (c) the
entering into an agreement that will result in a Change of Control; or (d) any material events
that the Issuer or Schaeffler AG announces publicly, in each case, a report containing a
description of such events.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS, except that the financial
statements required by clause (1)(c) above and the financial statements referred to in the next
following paragraph may be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the country in which the respective Person for which such financial statements are to be prepared is
organized (“Local GAAP;” in the case of a Person organized in Germany, Local GAAP shall mean
generally accepted accounting principles (Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchführung) under the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) as in effect from time to time). Except as provided
for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

If the consolidated total assets of any Restricted OpCo Group TopCo as of the end of any fiscal year
for which the Issuer is required to deliver an annual report with respect to such Restricted OpCo
Group TopCo pursuant to clause (1)(a) of the first paragraph of this covenant do not exceed €100
million, the Issuer may satisfy its obligation to deliver such annual report for such fiscal year by
delivering instead, within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of such Restricted OpCo Group
TopCo, annual unconsolidated financial statements for such Restricted OpCo Group TopCo consisting
of the information described in clause (1)(c) of the first paragraph of this covenant (as if such clause
applied to such Restricted OpCo Group TopCo). The Issuer shall not be required to deliver quarterly
reports pursuant to clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph of this covenant with respect to any Restricted
OpCo Group TopCo for any fiscal quarter if the consolidated total assets of such Restricted OpCo
Group TopCo as of the end of such fiscal quarter do not exceed €100 million.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the Holders and to securities analysts and
prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule
144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.


-----

The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first
paragraph of this covenant (i) on a website of or designated by the Issuer; and (ii) if and so long as
the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on
the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require,
post such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

For the purposes of this covenant, a “Material Transaction” shall mean any acquisition or disposition
by Schaeffler AG or any Restricted OpCo Group TopCo of any business whose consolidated total
assets (as determined on the basis of the most recently available financial statements for such
business prior to the date of such acquisition or disposition) exceed 20% of the Total Assets
immediately prior to such acquisition or disposition.

In the event that, and for so long as, equity securities of Schaeffler AG or a Restricted OpCo Group
TopCo are listed on any nationally recognized regulated stock exchange or listing authority in a
member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom or the United States (including, for
avoidance of doubt, the main market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) and Schaeffler AG or such
Restricted OpCo Group TopCo, as the case may be, is subject to the admission and disclosure
standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such stock exchange, the
provisions contained in clauses 1(a), 1(b), 2(a) and (3) of the first paragraph and in the fifth paragraph
of this covenant with respect to Schaeffler Group or such Restricted OpCo Group TopCo, as the case
may be, will be deemed to have complied with if the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, or Schaeffler AG
or such Restricted OpCo Group TopCo, as the case may be, publishes on a website of or designated
by Schaeffler AG or such Restricted OpCo Group TopCo, such annual and interim reports,
information, documents and other reports that Schaeffler AG or such Restricted OpCo Group TopCo,
as the case may be, is, or would be, required to file with such stock exchange pursuant to such
admission and disclosure standards.

At the Issuer’s option, the Issuer may provide annual consolidated financial statements for the Issuer,
consisting of an audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as of the end of the most recent
fiscal year and audited consolidated income statement and statement of cash flow of the Issuer for
the most recent fiscal year and in each case including comparative figures as of or for the previous
fiscal year, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the
independent auditors on the financial statements, in lieu of providing the information required by
clauses (1)(c) and (d) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

Any subsequent restatement of financial statements shall have no retroactive effect for purposes of
calculations previously made pursuant to the covenants contained in the Indenture.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for information purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual
or constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the compliance by the Issuer
or any Guarantor with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Events of Default and Remedies_**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default:”

(1) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption, required repurchase or
otherwise) of the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes; or

(2) default for 30 days in the payment when due of Cash Interest or PIK Interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes; or

(3) failure by the Issuer for 60 days to effect a Mandatory Excess PIK Interest Redemption in
accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Interest;” or


-----

(4) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after written notice to the Issuer by the
Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding,
voting as a single class, to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture (other than a
default in performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with
in clauses (1), (2) or (3)); or

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created
after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness at the Stated Maturity
thereof (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such
Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or
the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €100 million or more (or its
equivalent in any other currency or currencies); or

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final and enforceable judgments
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of €100 million (or its
equivalent in the applicable currency) (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been stayed,
discharged or waived for a period of 60 days after such judgment becomes final; or

(7) except as permitted by the Indenture, if (A) any Note Guarantee of a Guarantor that is a
Significant Subsidiary is by judicial decision declared to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases
for any reason to be in full force and effect; or (B) any of the Guarantors that is a Significant
Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee in writing; or

(8) with respect to any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of €50 million, individually
or in the aggregate, (A) the Liens with respect to such Collateral purported to be created
under any Security Document, after they are in full force and effect, at any time cease to be
in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the relevant Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) for any reason other
than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Notes or the release of such Liens in
accordance with the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or (B) the Liens with respect to such Collateral purported
to be created under any Security Document, are by final and enforceable judicial decision
declared invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default under clauses (A) or (B) continues for
10 days; or

(9) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; or

(10) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to
Schaeffler AG if such events are not cured or otherwise remedied within 30 days after their
occurrence.

In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (9) of the preceding paragraph, with respect to
the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted


-----

Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will
become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes may, and the Trustee, upon request of such holders, shall, declare all the
Notes to be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes
because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event
of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise
to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if the annulment of the acceleration of the
Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Indenture, it will not constitute a Default or an Event of
Default if the Sustainability Performance Target is not achieved, or if the Issuer or Schaeffler AG fails
to provide any Sustainability Compliance Certificate or Sustainability Report, and the sole recourse of
Holders in such instance shall be the right to receive the applicable Step-up Interest and/or the
applicable increase of the redemption premium for certain optional redemptions in the absence of
the occurrence of a Sustainability Compliance Event, as applicable.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture
and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of
principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder
which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such
Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such
Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain covenants—Reports” or otherwise to
deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to
be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate,
as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may
withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of
principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any Holders unless such Holders have
offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or
expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendment, _Supplement and_
_Waiver”) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or_


-----

Additional Amounts when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or
the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture.

### Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance 

The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth
in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the
outstanding Notes and all obligations of any Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note
Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such
payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make
Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant
**Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a**
Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all
Events of Default described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” (except those relating to
payments on the Notes or bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such entity appointed by the Trustee
for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, cash in euro, euro-denominated
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof in amounts as will be sufficient,
in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of
independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional
Amounts and premium, if any) on, the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment
thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must


-----

specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a
particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United
States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer has
received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or
(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax
law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm
that, the holders and beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will
be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of
United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the holders and
beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders over the other creditors of the
Issuer or any Guarantors with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of the Issuer, any Guarantors or others; and

(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel,
subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions
precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied
with.

### No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders 

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such,
will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes, the
Indenture, any Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not
be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.

### Amendment, supplement and waiver 

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, any Note
Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any
existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, any
Note Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that certain amendments to the Security Documents may be
made with the prior written consent of the Instructing Group.


-----

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then
outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which
any Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_redemption”;_

(4) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on
any Note;

(5) impair the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any
payment of principal or interest or Additional Amounts on or with respect to such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

(6) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional
Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes and a waiver of the Payment Default that resulted from such acceleration);

(7) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(8) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by
one of the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of
_Holders”);_

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) release all or substantially all of the Liens on the Collateral granted for the benefit of the
Holders, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the relevant Security
Document and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

Any amendment, supplement or waiver consented to by at least 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes will be binding against any non-consenting holders.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, any Guarantors, the
Trustee and the Security Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any Note
Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to Holders in the
case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or such
Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(3) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder in any
material respect;

(4) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Guarantees, any Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement to any provision of this “Description of the Notes”
to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a


-----

verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the
Security Documents, or the Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) to enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents;

(6) to release any Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to release the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents;

(8) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in
the Indenture;

(9) to allow any Restricted Subsidiary to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note
Guarantee with respect to the Notes;

(10) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided
that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or in a manner
such that the uncertificated Notes are not treated as “registration-required obligations”
under Section 163(f)(2)(A) of the Code);

(11) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the
Indenture; or

(12) to add additional parties to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to the
extent permitted hereunder and thereunder.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment.

In connection with its entry into any amendment, supplement or waiver, the Trustee shall be entitled
to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an
Officer’s Certificate.

For the purpose of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have consented to or
voted in favor of any amendment, supplement or waiver, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount
of any Notes shall be as of the Issue Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of articles 86 to
94-8 of the Luxembourg act dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, shall not
apply in respect of the Notes.

### Satisfaction and discharge 

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued
thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that
have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been
deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the
Trustee or the Paying Agent for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become
due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or
will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or an entity
designated by the Trustee for such purpose) as trust funds in trust solely for the


-----

benefit of the Holders, cash, Cash Equivalents, European Government Obligations or
a combination thereof, in each case, denominated in euro, in amounts as will be
sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued
interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the
Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply
the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption
date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that
any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer, the Trustee (or an entity designated by the Trustee for such
purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders of Notes prior to Stated Maturity or
the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that such Holders shall have received at
least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be
included in the notice of redemption or pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate). For
the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to Stated Maturity or
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent some or all of the Notes are
represented by Global Notes, any payment in respect of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Notes shall be subject to the then applicable procedures of the relevant clearing system.

### Judgment currency 

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantor under
the Indenture, the Notes and any Note Guarantees is euro. Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than euro in respect of the Notes (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any
Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Holder or by the Trustee in respect of any sum expressed to be due to
it from the Issuer or any Guarantor will constitute a discharge of the Issuer and such Guarantor only
to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received
or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to
make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that euro
amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer
and any Guarantors will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any
event the Issuer and any Guarantors will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such
purchase.

For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the
Holder or the Trustee to certify in writing to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the other obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantors, will give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any
Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full
force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect
of any sum due under any Note, any Note Guarantee or any other judgment or order.


-----

### Concerning the Trustee 

The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within 30 days of becoming aware of the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90
days or resign as Trustee.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that, in case an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to
use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions,
the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The Issuer and any Guarantors jointly and severally will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims,
liabilities and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part,
arising out of or in connection with its duties.

### Listing 

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Issuer has initially designated
Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as its agent for those purposes. The address of Deutsche Bank
Luxembourg S.A. is 2, boulevard Konrad Adenauer, L-1115 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

### Additional information 

Copies of the Indenture, which includes the form of Notes, and the Intercreditor may be obtained by
request to the Issuer.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
shall so require, copies of the financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum may be
obtained, free of charge, during normal business hours at the offices of the Listing Agent.

### Governing law 

The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture (including any
Note Guarantees) and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority
in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement will be
governed by English law. The Security Documents will be governed by German law.

### Consent to jurisdiction and service of process 

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will appoint Cogency Global, Inc., 122 East 42nd Street,
18th Floor, New York, NY 10168, USA, as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or
proceeding with respect to the Indenture and the Notes brought in any U.S. federal or New York
state court located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.


-----

### Enforceability of judgments 

Substantially all of the assets of the Issuer are outside the United States. As a result, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer may not be collectable within the United States. See
“Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

### Prescription 

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any,
on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five
years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

### Certain definitions

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. Reference is made to the Indenture
for a full disclosure of all defined terms used therein, as well as any other capitalized terms used
herein for which no definition is provided.

“Acquired Debt” means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at the time

such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition or (3) of a Person at the time such
Person merges with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary. Acquired Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been incurred, with respect to clause (1)
of the preceding sentence, on the date such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and, with

assets and, with respect to clause (3) of the preceding sentence, on the date of the relevant merger,
consolidation or other combination.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For purposes of
this definition, “control,” as used with respect to any Person, means the possession, directly or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such

purposes of this definition, the terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and “under common control
with” have correlative meanings.

(at a rate equal to the Cash Interest Rate that is in effect on the date on which the redemption notice
for such redemption is given) due on the Notes through, 2025 (but excluding accrued and
unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate
(subject to a 0.0% floor) plus 50 basis points over (B) the principal amount of such Notes on such

redemption date. For the avoidance of doubt, such calculation shall not be a duty of the Trustee or
any Paying Agent.

“Applicable Redemption Price” for purposes of the definition of “Applicable Premium” means, with
respect to Notes to be redeemed and any redemption date, the relevant redemption price for such
Notes and such redemption date as set forth in the table appearing under the caption “—Optional

Subsidiaries taken as a whole);

Shares, Restricted Schaeffler Shares, Restricted Vitesco Shares or Restricted Shares) made in

consummate any acquisition, provided that any cash or Cash Equivalents received in such
disposition are applied in accordance with the “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock” covenant._

“Asset Sale Offer” has the meaning assigned to that term in the Indenture governing the Notes.

“Associate” means (i) any Person of which the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries are the legal and
beneficial owners of between 20% and 50% of all outstanding Voting Stock and (ii) any joint venture

the revolving credit facility of any Credit Facility that refinances or replaces the Issuer Revolving
Facility Agreement) for the period starting on the 45th day preceding such interest payment date and
ending on the Business Day preceding the Applicable Amount Determination Date. The Average
Available RCF Drawings shall be calculated by a responsible Officer of the Issuer. For the avoidance of
doubt, such calculation shall not be a duty of the Trustee or any Paying Agent.


-----

“Average **Cash Balance” means, with respect to any interest payment date, the average daily balance**
of the aggregate amount of cash and Cash Equivalents of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
(excluding the proceeds from the offering of the Notes) for the period starting on the 45th day

Amount Determination Date, determined to give pro forma effect to the payment of any cash
interest payable on or prior to such interest payment date under the Issuer Revolving Facility
Agreement (or any Credit Facility that replaces the Issuer Revolving Facility Agreement) or any other
outstanding Indebtedness of any member of the Issuer Group. The Average Cash Balance shall be
calculated by a responsible Officer of the Issuer. For the avoidance of doubt, such calculation shall
not be a duty of the Trustee or any Paying Agent.

Cash Balance with respect to such interest payment date and (ii) the Average Available RCF Drawings
with respect to such interest payment date.

deposits and direct debits and (ii) daylight exposures of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
in respect of banking and treasury arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice.

“Beneficial Owner” has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the
Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date. The terms “Beneficially Owns” and “Beneficially Owned”
have a corresponding meaning.

“Board of Directors” means:

(1) with respect to any corporation, the board of directors (or analogous governing body) of the
corporation or any committee thereof duly authorized to act on behalf of such board;

(2) with respect to a partnership, the board of directors of the general partner of the

analogous governing body) or any controlling committee of managing members thereof; and

function.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the board of directors of any corporate entity with a
two-tier board means the management board of such entity (except that, for purposes of the
definition of the term “Voting Stock,” the board of directors of any corporate entity with a two-tier
board shall mean the board of such entity whose members are elected or appointed by such entity’s
shareholders).

“Bund Rate” means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of the
Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially
compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has become publicly available at
least two business days in Frankfurt am Main (but not more than five business days in Frankfurt am
Main) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available,
any publicly available source of similar market data selected in good faith by the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Issuer)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to []
, 2025; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to [],
2025, is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany
for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation
(calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations


-----

of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from
such redemption date to [], 2025,is less than one year, the weekly average yield on
actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity
of one year shall be used, provided that if such rate is less than zero, the Bund Rate shall be deemed
to be zero. For the avoidance of doubt, such calculation shall not be a duty of the Trustee or any
Paying Agent.

“Business Day” means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking
institutions in Frankfurt, London, Luxembourg or New York or a place of payment under the
Indenture are authorized or required by law to close.

Restricted OpCo Group TopCos, as the case may be) and the Combined Issuer Group Net
Interest shall be calculated for the relevant 12-month period by giving effect on a pro forma
basis as if Indebtedness incurred, repaid, repurchased, redeemed, defeased or otherwise
discharged (including with the proceeds of new Indebtedness) by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of the relevant 12-month period and on or prior

the discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or operations

-----

directly attributable to any Indebtedness repaid, repurchased or otherwise
discharged in connection with such discontinued operations (as determined in
accordance with IFRS) or disposal of operations or businesses (or ownership interests
therein) (or, if the shares of any Restricted Subsidiary of Schaeffler AG or any
Restricted OpCo Group TopCo are sold, the Consolidated Net Interest of such Person
for the relevant 12-month period directly attributable to the Indebtedness of such

continuing Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be) are no longer liable for such

Net Interest for the relevant 12-month period directly attributable to any
Indebtedness repaid, repurchased or otherwise discharged in connection with such
discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or disposal of
operations or businesses (or ownership interests therein) (or, if the shares of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Issuer Group are sold, the Combined
Issuer Group Net Interest for the relevant 12-month period directly attributable to
the Indebtedness of such Person if and to the extent the continuing members of the
Issuer Group are no longer liable for such Indebtedness after such sale); and

(c) if since the beginning of the relevant 12-month period and on or prior to such date of
determination the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries made an investment in any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (or any Person which becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of

ownership interests therein), Consolidated EBITDA of Schaeffler AG (or relevant Restricted
OpCo Group TopCos, as the case may be), Consolidated Net Interest of Schaeffler AG (or
relevant Restricted OpCo Group TopCos, as the case may be) and Combined Issuer Group Net
Interest for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the
incurrence of any Indebtedness) (as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer) as if such investment or acquisition had occurred on the first
day of the relevant 12-month period.

Whenever a pro forma effect is to be given to any calculation, the pro forma calculations will be
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (who may rely
on calculations of Schaeffler AG or relevant member of Restricted OpCo Group, as the case may be).
If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest
expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination
had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any interest rate hedging
applicable to such Indebtedness). Any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer on the date
of determination will be deemed to have been a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer at all times during
such four-quarter period. Any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer on the date of
determination will be deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer at any time
during such four-quarter period. Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any calculation of
Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Interest of Schaeffler AG pursuant to clauses (a) to (c) in
the preceding paragraph, Schaeffler AG and all Subsidiaries of Schaeffler AG shall be deemed to be
Restricted Subsidiaries, whether or not they have been designated as Restricted Subsidiaries.

## Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations

_The validity and enforceability of the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_
_and may be limited under applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity_
_and enforceability. The following is a summary description of certain limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Collateral, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the_
_jurisdiction in which the Issuer is organized. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or any of_
_its subsidiaries experienced financial difficulties, it is not possible to know with certainty in which_
_jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or what the_
_outcome of such proceedings would be. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of_
_the obligations of the Issuer. The descriptions below are only a summary and do not purport to be_
_complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Collateral. If additional Collateral is required to be granted pursuant to the_
_Indenture in the future, such Collateral will also be subject to limitations on enforceability and validity,_
_which may differ from those discussed below._

##### EU

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany, being a member state of the EU. As such, it is
subject to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (as amended) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which entered into
force on June 26, 2017 and applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date (subject to
certain exceptions).

The EU Insolvency Regulation is effective in all EU member states (other than Denmark). Pursuant to
the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of an EU member state (other than Denmark) will have
jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings if the company concerned has its center of main
interests (“COMI”) in that EU member state. The determination of where a company has its COMI is a
question of fact and is made at the time of the filing of the insolvency application. There is a
presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its COMI in the
EU member state in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (that
presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another member state of
the EU in the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings).
However, the EU Insolvency Regulation also states in its preamble at Recital 30 that the COMI of a
company should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its
interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third-parties. Courts have taken into
consideration a number of factors in determining the COMI of a company, including in particular,
where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its
business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are
established.

If main insolvency proceedings are validly opened in one EU member state, they will be recognized
and have effect in all other EU member states (other than Denmark) pursuant to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. If the company is found to have its COMI in a place other than the relevant EU member
state (other than Denmark), the courts of that EU member state will only have jurisdiction to open
secondary insolvency proceedings in that EU member state and only then provided that the company
concerned has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation) in that EU member state. An “establishment” is defined as “any place of
operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the
request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means
and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another EU member


-----

state will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such member state of the EU in the
three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of such secondary insolvency proceedings will be restricted to the assets of the company
located in that EU member state and the main insolvency proceedings will be opened in the EU
member state (other than Denmark) in which the company is found to have its COMI. Where main
proceedings in the EU member state in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been
commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another member state of
the EU where the debtor has an establishment and where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be
commenced in the EU member state in which the debtor’s COMI is situated because of the
conditions laid down by that EU member state’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency
proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the
operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the member state of the EU where the
opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the
EU member state within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request
the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings,
such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the
local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the
debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of
the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other member
states of the EU so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency
administrator appointed by a court in a member state of the EU which has jurisdiction to commence
main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by
the laws of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the
debtor from that other EU member state) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other EU member state or no preservation measures
have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that
other EU member state where the debtor has assets. If the company does not have an establishment
in any other member state of the EU, no court of any other EU member state has jurisdiction to open
territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The EU Insolvency Regulation created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties
by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency
practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of a
group’s members.

In addition, the concept of “group proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency Regulation
with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a
group of companies. Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination
proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings
of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened
in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the
coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan, however, is voluntary.

**_Insolvency_**

In the event of insolvency of the Issuer, subject to the statements made above under the heading “—
_EU” and absent any change in circumstances, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be_
initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. The insolvency laws
of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or
the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG)may not be as favorable to your interests

as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of
creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as security interests and the
duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency
laws. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer may be
opened in other jurisdictions.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings under German law with respect to a debtor
incorporated as a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or any
other corporation or partnership not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder must be
initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that,
according to German case law, the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they
fall due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant
provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its
liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values) unless, based on the
prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend
_wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve months (positive_
_Fortführungsprognose), which is temporarily shortened pursuant to the SanInsAG (as defined below)_
to a four month forecast horizon applicable during the period from November 9, 2022 to December
31, 2023. A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts when they fall due, in
addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending
illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to
an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings

If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—
_SE), or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder finds itself in a_
situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing directors of such company and, under
certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for insolvency without undue delay (ohne
_schuldhaftes Zögern), however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three weeks after_
illiquidity occurred and in the case of over-indebtedness at the latest six weeks after overindebtedness occurred (which period is temporarily extended pursuant to the SanInsKG (as defined
below) to eight weeks applicable during the period from November 9, 2022 to December 31, 2023).
Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well
as criminal sanctions. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), is a valid
insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company is currently able to service its
payment obligations but will presumably (predominant likelihood) not be able to continue to do so at
some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months).
However, in the case of imminent illiquidity only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not
obliged) to file for insolvency proceedings.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the
due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court
may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the
preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or
suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these
preliminary proceedings as far as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s
assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business.


-----

As part of such protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status
(Eigenverwaltung), meaning an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally
remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a
provisional custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), with this petition not being obviously futile
(offensichtlich aussichtslos). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the
decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard
and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which includes the continuation of the business carried out by
the debtor) and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and
dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency
administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured
creditors against the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be set up if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_
requirements: (i) a balance sheet total in excess of €6 million (after deducting an equity shortfall if
the debtor is over-indebted), (ii) revenues of at least €12 million in the twelve months prior to the
last balance sheet date and/or (iii) 50 or more employees on an annual average basis. The
requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of
other group companies. The preliminary creditor’s committee will be able to participate in certain
important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following:
the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for “debtor-in-possession” proceedings
(Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and appointments of provisional custodians (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter)._

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of main insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of_
impending illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor) or illiquidity and/or over-indebted
and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the
assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main
insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the
absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be
refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse) following which the company will,
_inter alia, be deemed dissolved and put into liquidation._

Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, the right to manage and dispose of the business
and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), who is
appointed by the insolvency court unless debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered
(in which case the court will only appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) who will supervise the
management of the debtor). The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to
change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator upon the occasion of the first creditors’
assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes
cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual
becoming insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible to be officeholder,
(i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial).

The insolvency administrator has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets,
whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator (or in
case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial
indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations and satisfaction of these
liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any


-----

insolvency claims of unsecured creditors (with the residual claim of a secured creditor remaining
after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency
proceedings against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

  - unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwoltung), the right to
administer and dispose of assets of a German subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to
the court-appointed (preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorläufiger) lnsolvenzverwalter)
as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

  - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals
effected by management of a German subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law;

  - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in
the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in
part of a German subsidiary of the Issuer’s property that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening
of formal insolvency proceedings;

  - claims against German subsidiaries of the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance
with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (lnsolvenzordnung); and

  - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderunq), i.e., the relevant asset of this
person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency
proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court
proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)),
wishing to assert claims against the debtor in person need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally
no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance
with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any individual
enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckungsmaßnahmen) already brought against the debtor by any of
its creditors is, in principle, subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been
opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and
the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the
insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent
sufficient assets are available).

Certain secured creditors have preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) regarding the enforcement
of their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to
enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency
administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor
remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by
the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has the
sole right to (i) realize any movable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential
rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte) as
well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen).


-----

According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled
to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or,
insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator
has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. There is,
however, no authoritative case law on this question.

In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds
minus certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets
(Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the
aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to
the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured
claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings and after
satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities, be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured
creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security
interests, the Note Holders. If the Issuer grants security over its assets to other creditors than the
Note Holders, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of such other creditors’ secured
claims (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the
disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from the disposal of collateral
provided to such other creditors may not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of the Note Holders
against the Issuer. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not
necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this
right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with
specific rules. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the
insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors.

A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan
(Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor as well as the
consent of a majority of creditor classes and, within each approving class, the majority of creditors
belonging to such class of creditors (in accordance with specific majority rules and cramdown rules)
and the approval of the insolvency court. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement
a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor
into a debt-to-equity swap if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap. Creditors secured by
pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard
to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public
auction outside the insolvency process.

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigen_verwaltung), if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turnaround_
plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not
aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on
incorrect assumptions. If the debtor files for insolvency proceedings on grounds of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) or imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), it may also file for protective
shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless, from a third-party perspective, there is no
reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. Such protective shield will not be available if the
debtor is already illiquid; however, if the debtor actually becomes illiquid at a later point in time this
will not automatically terminate protective shield proceedings. Upon request of the debtor, the court
deciding on the application for protective shield proceedings will appoint a provisional custodian
(vorläufiger Sachwalter) and order provisional measures which appear necessary in order to avoid
any detriment to the financial status of the debtor until the decision on the opening of main
proceedings (vorläufige Sicherungsmaßnahmen), including a stay on certain enforcement measures
(other than with respect to immoveable assets), for up to three months. During that period of either


-----

preliminary debtor in possession proceedings (vorläufige Eiqenverwaltunq) or the preliminary
protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which
ideally will be implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after
formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that,
despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one
separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency
reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally
independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no
consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no
pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. On April 13, 2017, the German legislator
passed an act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der
_Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), which came into force on April 21, 2018. This act, however, is_
mainly intended to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of
group companies. This act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the
insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or
pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key
amendments of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in order to facilitate an efficient
administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group
company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as
insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination
obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees;
and (iv) certain parties may apply for coordination proceedings (Koordinationsverfahren) and the
appointment of a coordinator (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a coordination plan
(Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not
limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of
funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the
insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims
of regular, unsecured creditors. The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the
Indenture may result in the Note Holders and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a
shareholder-like position (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding
over the assets of the Issuer, the claims arising from the liabilities under the Notes would be treated
as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency
claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer unless
the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated
insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by
German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the
opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors.
See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.”

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrators opt for performance.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an
agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for
insolvency proceedings or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings
(insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the
election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they


-----

reflect the termination rights (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) applicable under statutory law.
This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully avoided by the insolvency
administrator or custodian, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction,
performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer based on and governed by the
insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the Note Holders as well as the granting
of collateral for or providing credit support in respect of the Notes could be subject to potential
challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (or, in the event that debtor-inpossession status has been granted, the custodian (Sachwalter)) under the rules of avoidance as set
out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under these rules, an insolvency administrator (or custodian) may avoid (anfechten) transactions,
performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected
prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. Such
challengeable transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the Note Holders as well as
granting them any security interest. The administrator’s right to avoid transactions can, depending on
the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition
for commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event a transaction, performance or other act is successfully avoided, the Security Trustee and
the Note Holders would be under an obligation to repay any amounts derived from such challenged
transaction, performance or act to the insolvency estate or to waive the benefit of the security
interest.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term also includes the
provision of security and the repayment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be
avoided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), inter alia, in the following
cases:

  - any act or transaction granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, a security (including
a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be avoided if such act or
transaction was effected (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of such act or transaction the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig, i.e., unable to pay its debt when due) and the creditor had
knowledge thereof (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity), or
(ii) after a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the
creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid (or of circumstances that
imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing);

  - any act or transaction granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, a security (including
a guarantee) or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no right at the
respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be avoided if such act was taken
during the last month prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings or after such filing; if the act or transaction was taken during the second or third
month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of such act or transaction (i) the
debtor was illiquid, or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such
detrimental effect);

  - a transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors of
the debtor or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a


-----

proprietary claim against the debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, can be avoided if the
transaction was effected (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction
the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or
(ii) after a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the
debtor and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being
illiquid;

- any act of a debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants a security
interest (including a guarantee) for a third-party debt might be regarded as having been
granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)) can be avoided if it was effected during the four years
prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the
debtor;

- any act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted
with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche
_Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of_
such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the
beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the
debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act
disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a
creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such
creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the
beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and
that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a
payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that
he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

- any non-gratuitous contract (unentgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and a
related party (nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors
can be avoided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of
the debtor’s intention to prejudice its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in
relation to corporate entities, the term ‘related party’ includes, subject to certain limitations,
members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning
more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable
positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and
other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons;

- any act that provides security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an equivalent claim can be avoided if (i) in the
event it provided security, the act was taken during the last ten years prior to the filing of a
petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it
resulted in satisfaction, the act was taken during the last year prior to the filing of a petition for
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; it being understood, that the
regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (x) to shareholders that own 10% or less of the
shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (y) until the successful
restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor acquires for the first time shares during overindebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and


-----

  - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent
claim to a third party, can be voided if the act was taken during the last year prior to the filing
of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder
of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a surety (Garant or Bürge) (in which case
the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further
conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a subsidiary subject to the German
insolvency laws) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice,
the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general
statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

If the Collateral granted by the Issuer were avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, a holder of
the Notes would cease to have any claim or benefit in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a
transaction that had been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has
obtained an enforcement order but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy
of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the
payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Act on Avoidance
(Anfechtungsgesetz). The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and
the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance
in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the
debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency
at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the
creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors
of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could
be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the
debtor as the grantor of the security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to
enquire further with respect thereto.

Finally, the insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors
against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims
shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and
according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty
payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency
proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the
proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such
incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay
money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for
restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

The Act on the Temporary Adaptation of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate
Crisis Consequences (Sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtliches Krisenfolgenabmilderungsgesetz
(“SanInsKG”), that has incorporated the former Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for
Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19
pandemic (COVID-19-Insolvenzaussetzungsgesetz)), however, provides for privileged treatment of
new financing and shareholder loans under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a


-----

certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable
interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be
considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was granted between March 1,
2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing
duties at the time.

This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but
does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or
receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a loan.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the
“Preventive Restructuring Directive”) has been adopted. In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring
Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German Restructuring and
Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the
introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (“Company
**Stabilization and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-**
court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act
(“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to
affected creditors or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens).

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act
upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when
it is likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over
(generally) the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of
the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for
regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met.

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do
not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility
under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to
cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under
the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor
requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilization and
Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum
and the tools can, under certain circumstances, even be used without the need for any public notices
despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization and
Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an
important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by
entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the
Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of
the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group
insolvencies.

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court
restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the
principal amounts, interest rates or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also
negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the
debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally
be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or
majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of
the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the
voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the


-----

value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed
capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be
adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided
certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class
_cramdown)._

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by
the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring
plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the
application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or
all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three
months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months
subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the Note Holders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the
Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries having their COMI
in Germany would be the following:

  - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no
or only limited review or supervision by a court;

  - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a
period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order;

  - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be
compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction
in principal or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release
and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right);

  - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective
collateral; and

  - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any
holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites
for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the Note Holders.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be
recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation
(Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on
insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A
of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain
rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” (akzessorisch) security interests such as pledges
(Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person.
Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the
extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) cannot be assigned independently but
would automatically follow the claims which they secure in case that the relevant secured claim is
assigned and (iii) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The
Note Holders will not be party to the Security Documents relating to the Collateral. In order for the
Note Holders to benefit from security under “accessory” Collateral, the Issuer Security Pooling and
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt,
the Security Trustee becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor


-----

under the Notes. The pledges governed by German law will only secure the parallel debt claims of the
Security Trustee rather than securing the Note Holders’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel
debt procedure has not been tested in court under German law, therefore the possibility cannot be
ruled out that this concept will not be recognized by German courts or that the courts will eliminate
or mitigate the validity or the enforceability of accessory security interests, and that the ability of the
Security Trustee to enforce the collateral may thus be restricted. Similar concerns would apply for
any future pledgee concept included in the relevant pledge agreement. In addition, Note Holders
bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Trustee.

The security interests of the Security Trustee may also be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in the collateral. For example, the enforcement of
ownership interests and pledges may be subject to certain specific requirements, and the Security
Trustee may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot
assure you that the Security Trustee will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure
you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on
such assets. Accordingly, the Security Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon those
assets, and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease. German law does not generally
permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The
enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting
the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods
and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the
collateral gives the Security Trustee the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted
such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have
held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking)
in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no
right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by
other creditors).

Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security purposes
must not be excessive. Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim
the release of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (where the value of
security interest granted significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured
obligations), or security interest can even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive overcollateralization. As a general rule, value of collateral should not exceed the amount of the secured
obligations by more than 50%. A security transfer or assignment violating this rule either in itself or in
combination with other security interests will be deemed void if the violation exists at the time the
collateral is granted. If the ratio is exceeded later as a result of partial prepayment or of progressing
repayment of the secured obligations, the security grantor is entitled to a corresponding ratable
release of the collateral. There is no clear authority as to how the ratio has to be applied in the
context of a financing involving several companies and to what extent accessory forms of collateral
(e.g. share pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be taken into account. While the
German Federal High Court (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case-by-case basis, legal
authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization is given if the realization value of the security
exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims.

## Book-entry, Delivery and Form

### General

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Note”). Notes sold to non-U.S. persons
outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”).

Each Regulation S Global Note representing the Notes (each such note, a “Regulation S Global Note”
and, collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the closing date, with a
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each Rule 144A Global Note representing the Notes (each such note, a “144A Global Note” and,
collectively, the “144A Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the closing date, with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream. The 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are together
referred to as the “Global Notes.”

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and,
together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through
such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, the Notes will not
be issued in definitive form. For the purposes of the International Central Securities Depositories, the
denomination of the Notes should be considered as €1 and Euroclear and Clearstream are not
required to monitor or enforce the minimum denomination/tradeable amount of, e.g., €100,000.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may
impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in
global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes
for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective
nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to
exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the
records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.


-----

### Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be
taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above)
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of
Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents or waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the
Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserve the right to
exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive
**Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.**

### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that we issue
or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not
only to the owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or
us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and
such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless
that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent and the relevant Registrar
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and
no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will
be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such
registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the BookEntry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

### Redemption of Global Notes 

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear
and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to


-----

prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate, provided,
however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in
part.

### Payments on Global Notes 

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Principal Paying Agent. The Principal
Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will distribute such payments to participants
in accordance with their respective customary procedures. We will make payments of all such
amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as
described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such deduction or
withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts,” we will pay Additional Amounts as may be necessary in order for the net_
amounts received in respect of the Global Notes or Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding to equal the net amounts that would have otherwise been received in respect of such
Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We
expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will treat the registered
holders of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominee)) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none
of us, the Trustee and the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

  - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

### Currency of Payment for the Global Notes 

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream in
euro.

### Transfers 

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes
to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities,
such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture governing the Notes.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”


-----

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the
U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction._

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and exchange” and, if required,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other
Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such
a Book-Entry Interest.


-----

### Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream 

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures
solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are
controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally
traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and
Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge
such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream
system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a
definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take
physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global
Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

### Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-entry System

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the LuxSE and admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are
under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may
be discontinued or modified at any time. None of us, the Issuer, the Trustee or the relevant Paying
Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants
or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

### Initial Settlement

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for
value of the settlement date.


-----

### Secondary Market Trading 

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle
in same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at
the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts
are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

While the Notes may only be traded in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1 in
excess thereof, for purpose of the clearing systems the denominations may be considered as €1. For
the avoidance of doubt the clearing systems may not be required to monitor or enforce the minimum
amount.

## Taxation

### Responsibility of the Issuer for the Withholding of Taxes at Source

The Issuer does not assume any responsibility for the withholding of taxes at source.

### Taxation in the Federal Republic of Germany

This tax section deals with certain German tax consequences to be made under German law from the
proceeds of the investment in the Notes and Additional PIK Notes (as defined in the “Description of
_the Notes”). It is based on the laws in force on the date of this Offering Memorandum, of general_
nature only and is neither intended as, nor to be understood as, legal or tax advice. The information
is not exhaustive and does not constitute a definitive explanation of all possible aspects of taxation
that could be relevant for an investor. Any information given hereafter reflects the opinion of the
Issuer and must not be misunderstood as a representation or guarantee with regard to potential tax
deductions. Further, the withholding tax consequences depend on the individual facts and
circumstances at the level of the investor and may be subject to future changes in law which could
potentially have retroactive effect. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this section
“Taxation in the Federal Republic of Germany” to the Notes include any Additional PIK Notes that are
issued.

The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate for certain investment income and, in
particular, interest income on the part of German tax resident private investors. There is an ongoing
discussion in Germany whether the reduced tax rate should be increased or abolished so that
investment income would be taxed at higher rates. It is still unclear whether, how and when the
current discussion may result in any legislative changes.

**_Withholding Tax_**

For German tax residents (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of
management is located in Germany), Cash Interest payments on the Notes and, under certain
conditions, also any PIK Interest are subject to withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer), provided that
the Notes are held in custody with or administrated by a German custodian, which deducts the
withholding tax from such investment income paid or credited (the “Disbursing Agent,” auszahlende
_Stelle). Disbursing Agents are German credit institutions, financial services institutions (each including_
German permanent establishments of foreign institutions), securities trading companies and
securities trading banks. The applicable withholding tax rate is 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge
thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%).

For individuals who are subject to church tax, an electronic information system for church
withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment income, with the effect that also church
tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has filed a
blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für
_Steuern) in which case the investor will be assessed to church tax. Further, church tax is not collected_
by way of withholding if the investment income forms part of income from trade business, selfemployment, agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing.

The withholding tax regime should also apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes realized by investors holding the Notes as private (and not as business) assets in
custody or administration with a Disbursing Agent. The withholding tax charge is generally levied on
the difference between the proceeds received upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Notes (after the deduction of actual expenses directly related thereto) and the
acquisition costs, if the Notes have been held with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their
acquisition. If PIK Interest was taxed as accrued, the taxed amount should be recognized as


-----

acquisition costs of the Additional PIK Notes or as additional acquisition costs of the Notes for
taxation purposes. If similar Notes kept or administered in the same custodial account were acquired
at different points in time, the Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the
purposes of determining the capital gains. Where Notes are acquired and/or sold or redeemed in a
currency other than euro, the sales/redemption price and the acquisition costs have to be converted
into euro on the basis of the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and
the acquisition date, respectively, with the result that any currency gains or losses are part of the
capital gains. If Cash Interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds
from the disposal are also subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the
payment of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately and to proceeds from the
payment of PIK Interest claims, if the PIK Interest was not taxed as accrued.

To the extent the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same
Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 26.375% (including solidarity surcharge, plus church
tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued
**Interest” (Stückzinsen)), if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been notified of the actual**
acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of the previous
bank, financial services or securities institution from another Member State of the European Union or
the European Economic Area or certain other countries (e.g., Switzerland or Andorra).

The Disbursing Agent deducts from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income
realized by the private investor of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of
other capital investments with the exception of shares in stock corporations and forward
transactions). It also deducts Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon
the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent credits foreign withholding taxes levied on
investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the private investor in the custodial
account with the Disbursing Agent. However, expenses actually incurred are not deductible.

No withholding tax will be deducted if the total investment income of a private investor does not
exceed the annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for couples and partners filing
jointly), provided that such private investor has filed a withholding exemption certificate
(Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent. However, such non-deduction applies only to the
extent that the investment income of such private investor does not exceed the respective available
maximum allowance amount shown on the withholding exemption certificate. Furthermore, no
withholding tax will be deducted if the investor has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of
non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent local tax office.

German resident corporate and other German resident business investors should generally not be
subject to withholding tax on capital gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
of the Notes (i.e., for these investors only Cash Interest payments and, under certain conditions, PIK
Interest are subject to the withholding tax regime, irrespective of any deduction of foreign
withholding tax and capital losses incurred).

Subject to further requirements, non-German tax residents should generally not be subject to the
German withholding tax regime in respect of the receipt of interest income and capital gains from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes. This should generally hold true,
even if the Notes are held in custody with or are administered by a Disbursing Agent. Exceptions
apply, e.g., where the Notes are held as business assets of a German permanent establishment or a
German permanent representative. If the investment income from the Notes is subject to German
taxation, such non-resident holder is subject to a withholding tax treatment similar to that described
above for German tax residents.


-----

Where Notes are not kept in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent and proceeds from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of a Note are paid by a Disbursing Agent to a nonresident investor upon delivery of the Notes, withholding tax generally will also apply.

The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax
treaty, subject to further requirements and restrictions.

Furthermore, payments made to a holder resident in a so-called “non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht
_kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) should be subject to a tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a_
rate of 15% (plus solidarity surcharge) of the gross payment pursuant to the German Act to Avert Tax
Evasion and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem
_Steuerwettbewerb). However, according to recently introduced legislation no withholding tax will be_
levied if bearer notes are represented by a global note (Sammelurkunde), are held in collective safe
custody with a central depositary, and are tradable on a recognized stock exchange.

**Prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the individual tax**
**consequences arising from the investment in the Notes.**

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is
located in Germany).

Income (i.e. interest income and capital gains) derived from capital investments under the Notes held
by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany, irrespective of any holding period, is in
general subject to German income tax at a flat tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church
tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment
(Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum
annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for couples and partners filing jointly),
whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not
deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income
from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as
described under “—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied,
such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the
payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has
been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), the individual
holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax
return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable,
church tax thereon). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has
been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), an individual
holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds, must apply for an
assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs. Further, an individual holder may apply
for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an
assessment to tax with any amounts over withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of
expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. The offsetting of losses
incurred by an individual holder is subject to several restrictions. Losses incurred with respect to the
Notes may only be offset with investment income realized in the same or following assessment
periods. According to new legislation, capital losses of private investors resulting from a bad debt loss
(Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or if the Notes expire worthless can
only be offset against income derived from capital investments up to an amount of €20,000.00 per


-----

annum Losses exceeding that threshold can be carried forward and set-off against income derived
from capital investments up to an amount of €20,000.00 per annum in subsequent years, subject to
certain requirements.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or where the
income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding
tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject
to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax
thereon). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest income (including Accrued Interest)
and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income
and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s
applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the
personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or
corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business
the current income and capital gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the
Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on
the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) applicable to the investor. If the holder is an
individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or
partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

**_Non Tax—Residents_**

This subsection “—Non Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e.,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and
control is not located in Germany).

Interest income (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains (which include currency gains and
losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by
holders who are not tax resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i)
the holder of the Note is tax resident in a non-cooperative jurisdiction as determined pursuant to the
German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von
_Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb) and the above mentioned exemption (as_
described under “—Withholding Tax” above) does not apply, (ii) the Notes form part of the business
property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base
maintained in Germany by the holder or (iii) the income otherwise constitutes German source
income (such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate or income
from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate, unless the Notes
qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody
Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen); this
exception does not apply in case the fungible notes representing the same issue qualify as
convertible bonds (Wandelanleihen) or profit sharing bonds (Gewinnobligationen)). In cases (ii) and
(iii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under “—Tax Residents” applies. If holders who are
not tax resident in Germany are subject to German taxation, the German tax authorities may request,
under certain circumstances, if appropriate to secure the relevant tax claims and on a case-by-case
basis, that the debtor of a payment to the respective holder under the Notes (Vergütungsschuldner)
withholds the respective holder’s relevant German tax. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax
resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the
proceeds by way of an over the counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are
not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements, a
holder who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions
provided by an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).


-----

**_Solidarity surcharge_**

The solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished as of the assessment period 2021 for certain
individuals. The solidarity surcharge shall, however, continue to apply for investment income and,
thus, on withholding taxes levied. In case the individual income tax burden for a private investor of
Notes tax resident in Germany is lower than 25% such holder can apply for his/her investment
income being assessed at his/her individual tariff-based income tax rate in which case solidarity
surcharge would be refunded.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or
gift tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a
resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany or in certain cases for German citizens who
previously maintained a residence in Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or
deemed to be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes
will be levied unless the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent
establishment or fixed base is maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in
Germany or the obligations under the Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real
estate (unless the Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)). Should a double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) be in
effect in the individual case, however, German taxation provisions may be restricted thereby.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with
the issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any notarial
fees). However, under certain conditions, entrepreneurs for VAT purposes may opt for a liability to
value added tax with regard to the sale of Notes which would otherwise be tax exempt. Currently,
net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (“FTT”)_**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s
**Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy,**
Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “Participating Member States”) and Estonia. However,
Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
the Notes or Additional PIK Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both
within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings
in the Notes or Additional PIK Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least
one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed
to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including
(a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the
financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

At the ECOFIN Council meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented
on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the
participating Member States (excluding Estonia) to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint
French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle
would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the
European Union.


-----

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between Participating Member States. It
may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member States may decide to
participate. Therefore, it is currently uncertain whether and when the proposed FTT will be enacted
by the Participating Member States and when it will take effect with regard to dealings in the Notes
or Additional PIK Notes.

Prospective holders of the Notes or Additional PIK Notes are advised to seek their own professional
advice in relation to the FTT.

### U.S. Taxation 

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to U.S. Holders
and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes. This
summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), final,
temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations, all
of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not discuss all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to investors in light of their particular
circumstances, such as investors subject to special tax rules (including, without limitation: (i) financial
institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in stocks, securities, currencies or
notional principal contracts; (iv) regulated investment companies; (v) real estate investment trusts;
(vi) tax-exempt organizations; (vii) partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements, or
persons that hold Notes through pass-through entities or arrangements; (viii) investors that hold
Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ix) U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S.
dollar; (x) U.S. expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States; (xi) persons subject
to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being
taken into account in an applicable financial statement; and (xii) holders having notes redeemed in
the Issuer Notes Redemption, each of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from
those summarized below. This summary does not address U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare
contribution or alternative minimum tax considerations or non-U.S., state or local tax considerations
and does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the Notes
as part of the initial distribution at their issue price (generally, the first price to the public at which a
substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money). This summary assumes that investors will hold
their Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment).

For the purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Notes that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a
corporation that is created in, or organized under the laws of, the United States or any state thereof,
including the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for
U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (iv) a trust the administration of which is
subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more United States persons
who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if it has properly elected
under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a
beneficial owner of Notes that is not a U.S. Holder.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a
partnership that acquires, holds or disposes of the Notes will depend on the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. Partnerships should consult their own tax advisors concerning the
U.S. federal income tax consequences to their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition
of the Notes.


-----

**_U.S. Holders_**

_Characterization of the Notes_

As described under “Description of the Notes” and in more detail below, under certain circumstances
the Issuer may make additional payments on the Notes or have the option to make payments of
interest as PIK Interest. Although not free from doubt, the Issuer intends to take the position that
U.S. Holders should account for the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes using a payment
schedule which assumes all stated interest payments on the Notes will be paid in cash and which
does not include such additional payments or payments of PIK Interest. However, these additional
payments and/or payments of PIK Interest could be viewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) as causing the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”). If the
Notes were to be treated as CPDIs, U.S. Holders may be required to recognize income for U.S. federal
income tax purposes at different times and in different amounts than described below, to treat any
income realized on a taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than capital gain, and to
suffer additional adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. The Issuer intends to take the
position that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Notes should not be treated as CPDIs. No
rulings have been or will be sought from the IRS on this matter. The Issuer’s determination that the
Notes should not be treated as CPDIs is binding on a holder unless such holder discloses its contrary
position in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury regulations.

Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences in the event the Notes are treated as CPDIs for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

_Original Issue Discount_

The Notes will be treated as being issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes because their “stated redemption price at maturity” will exceed their “issue price” by
an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount. The “stated redemption
price at maturity” of the Notes will be equal to the sum of all payments due on the Notes other than
“qualified stated interest.” The “issue price” will be equal to the first price at which a substantial
amount of the Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. Qualified
stated interest on a debt instrument is stated interest that is “unconditionally payable” in cash or
property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer) at least annually at a single fixed rate. Because
interest on the Notes may, if certain conditions are satisfied, be payable at the option of the Issuer in
PIK Interest, and the payment of PIK Interest is not a remote contingency, interest on the Notes
(including any Cash Interest) will not be treated as unconditionally payable at least annually and will
therefore not be treated as qualified stated interest. Accordingly, the Notes will be treated as being
issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the “stated redemption price at maturity”
will include all payments due on the Notes. The amount of OID on the Notes will be equal to the
excess of such Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity over their issue price.

U.S. Holders of Notes will be required to include OID (including additional amounts in respect of
withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld, if any) as ordinary income
calculated on a constant yield method potentially before the receipt of cash attributable to the
income, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax accounting, and will generally have to
include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID over the life of the Notes. The amount of OID
includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note
for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the
Note (“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual
period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. Accrual periods with respect to
a Note may be of any length selected by the U.S. Holder and may vary in length over the term of the
Note as long as (i) no accrual period is longer than one year and (ii) each scheduled payment of


-----

interest or principal on the Note occurs on either the final or first day of an accrual period. The
amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is determined by multiplying the “adjusted issue price”
(as defined herein) of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period by the “yield to maturity” of
such Note (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted to reflect the length of the accrual period). The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the
beginning of any accrual period generally is the issue price of the Note increased by (x) the amount of
accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by (y) the amount of all cash payments
made with respect to such Note in all prior accrual periods. The “yield to maturity” of the Note is the
discount rate that causes the present value of all payments on the Note as of its original issue date to
equal the issue price of such Note.

In certain circumstances the Issuer has the option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes on certain
dates or upon certain events (see “Description of the Notes—Optional redemption” and “Description
_of the Notes—Redemption for changes in taxes”). In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change_
in control events, a holder may be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes at a
premium (see “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Change of Control”).
The U.S. Treasury regulations contain special rules for determining the payment schedule and the
yield and maturity of a debt instrument in the event the debt instrument provides for a contingency
that could, for example, result in the acceleration or deferral of one or more payments. For purposes
of determining the yield and maturity of the Notes, we intend to take the position that, as of the
issue date, the Issuer will not exercise its redemption option (see “Description of the Notes—Optional
_redemption”) because such exercise would not reduce the yield of the Notes. Furthermore, the_
payment schedule of the Notes that does not take into account a holder’s option to require the
Issuer to repurchase the Notes at a premium upon certain change of control events (see “Description
_of the Notes—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Change of Control”) should also be used for_
purposes of determining the yield and maturity of the Notes because such payment schedule is
significantly more likely than not to occur and/or because such contingency should be viewed as
remote or incidental.

In addition, for purposes of computing the yield to maturity of the Notes and the amount of OID
attributable to each accrual period, we intend to take the position that the Issuer and each U.S.
Holder are required under U.S. Treasury regulations to use a payment schedule in which all of the
stated interest on the Notes is initially assumed to be paid in cash (rather than PIK Interest). This
assumption is made solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and does not constitute a
representation by the Issuer regarding the likelihood that interest on the Notes will be paid in cash.

If the Issuer, however, exercises its redemption option or its option to pay PIK Interest, or makes a
mandatory redemption payment for excess PIK Interest, if a holder exercises its option to require the
Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control events or if any
other change in circumstances results in the payment of Additional Amounts, the yield and maturity
of the Notes will be redetermined using the new payment schedule by treating the Notes (solely for
purposes of redetermining the yield, maturity and OID) as retired and reissued in an amount equal to
their adjusted issue price on the date the relevant option is exercised or the date of such other
change in circumstances, in each case, with respect to Notes that continue to remain outstanding
after such change in circumstances. Such deemed reissued Notes could be subject to the Treasury
regulations applicable to CPDIs.

Any PIK Interest will generally not be treated as a payment of interest on an original Note for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Instead, any Additional PIK Note together with the original Note will be
treated as a single debt instrument for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

OID will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars. The U.S.
dollar value of any accrued OID will be determined by translating such OID at the average exchange
rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two


-----

taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). A U.S.
Holder may elect to translate accrued OID using the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the
accrual period or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in
effect on the last day of the part of the period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year. Additionally, if
the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued OID,
an electing U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued OID into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in
effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the
U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter
acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

OID accrued with respect to the Notes should generally constitute income from sources outside the
United States, subject to the rules regarding the U.S. foreign tax credit allowable to a U.S. Holder
(and the limitations imposed thereon, including restrictions under the recently issued U.S. Treasury
regulation as discussed below).

The tax rules relating to the determination of the amount of OID allocable by a U.S. Holder to each
accrual period are complex. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors
regarding any tax consequences to them of our decision to exercise, or not exercise, the redemption
option or the option to pay PIK Interest, including any deemed retirement and reissuance of the
Notes upon the exercise of any such option.

_Payments of Cash Interest_

In general, each payment made in cash under a Note will be treated first as a payment of any accrued
OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and
secondly as a payment of principal (which is not includible in income). A U.S. Holder generally will not
be required to include separately in income cash payments received on a Note to the extent such
payments constitute payments of previously accrued OID.

Non-U.S. withholding tax, if any, imposed on a U.S. Holder may, at the election of such holder, be
treated as foreign income tax eligible for credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability
or a deduction in computing taxable income, to the extent such tax is not otherwise refundable.
There are significant and complex limits on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits, and
recently issued U.S. Treasury regulations further restrict the availability of any such credit based on
the nature of the withholding tax imposed by the foreign jurisdiction.

Upon receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest
upon the sale or other disposition of a Note), a U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange gain
or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
received (translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar
value of the amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into
U.S. dollars. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale,
exchange, or redemption and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the cost of such Note to such U.S. Holder increased
by the amount of OID previously included in the U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Note and
reduced by the amount of any cash payments made with respect to the Note. A U.S. Holder’s tax
basis in a Note will be determined by reference to the U.S. dollar cost of the Notes and the U.S. dollar
value of any cash payments made with respect to the Note. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased
with a foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of
purchase or, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market (as defined in the


-----

applicable U.S. Treasury regulations) that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual
basis U.S. Holder that so elects), on the settlement date for the purchase. Such an election by an
accrual basis U.S. Holder must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be revoked
without the consent of the IRS.

Although not free from doubt, a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis, adjusted issue price and accrued
and unpaid OID in a Note should be allocated between the original Note and any Additional PIK Note
issued upon the Issuer’s exercise of the option to pay PIK Interest in proportion to their relative
principal amounts.

Gain or loss recognized upon a sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition (except as
discussed below with respect to exchange gain or loss) generally will be capital gain or loss and will
be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable
disposition the Note has been held by such U.S. Holder for more than one year, and will generally be
treated as from U.S. sources for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation.

Although not free from doubt, a U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to an Additional PIK Note
issued if the option to pay PIK Interest is exercised would likely be identical to its holding period for
the original Note with respect to which the Additional PIK Note was received.

The amount realized on a sale or other disposition of a Note for an amount in foreign currency will be
the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of sale or other disposition or, in the case of
Notes traded on an established securities market (as defined in the applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations) that are sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects),
on the settlement date for the sale or other disposition. Such an election by an accrual basis U.S.
Holder must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of
the IRS.

In the case of a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, the maximum federal income tax rate
applicable to capital gains is currently lower than the maximum marginal rate applicable to ordinary
income if the Notes are held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
significant limitations.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note that is
attributable to changes in exchange rates will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and
generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Gain or loss attributable to changes in
exchange rates generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
Holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the exchange rate in effect on
the date the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s
purchase price for the Note, determined at the exchange rate in effect on the date the U.S. Holder
purchased such Note (or, in each case, on the settlement date, if the Notes are traded on an
established securities market, as defined in the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, and the holder is
either a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). In addition, upon the sale or
other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or
loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid OID, if any, which will be
treated as discussed above under “—Original Issue Discount” and “—Payments of Cash Interest.”
However, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, exchange gain or loss (including with
respect to accrued OID) is taken into account only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on such
sale or other taxable disposition of the Note.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion concerning information reporting and backup withholding below, a NonU.S. Holder generally should not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any
payments on the Notes and gain from the sale, redemption or other disposition of the Notes unless:


-----

(i) that payment and/or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by that Non-U.S. Holder of a
trade or business in the United States; (ii) in the case of any gain realized on the sale or exchange of a
Note by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, that Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange or retirement and certain other conditions are met; or
(iii) the Non-U.S. Holder is subject to tax pursuant to provisions of the Code applicable to certain U.S.
expatriates.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of principal, interest (including accrued OID) on, and the proceeds of a sale,
redemption or other disposition of, the Notes, payable to a U.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent or
other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under
applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Backup withholding will apply to these payments if the U.S.
Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or
otherwise to comply with the applicable backup withholding requirements. Certain U.S. Holders
(including, among others, corporations) are not subject to information reporting and backup
withholding. A U.S. Holder can claim a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability, or a refund,
for amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing appropriate U.S. tax
returns.

In general, payments of principal, interest and accrued OID on, and the proceeds of a sale,
redemption or other disposition of, the Notes, payable to a Non-U.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent or
other U.S. intermediary will not be subject to backup withholding if appropriate certification (IRS
Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or other appropriate form) is timely provided by the Non-U.S. Holder to the
payer and the payer does not have actual knowledge that the certificate is false. Such payments,
however, generally may be subject to information reporting requirements (unless the Non-U.S.
Holder otherwise establishes an exemption).

**_Reportable Transactions_**

A U.S. taxpayer that participates in a “reportable transaction” will be required to disclose its
participation to the IRS. A U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from
the Notes as a reportable transaction if the loss exceeds certain specified thresholds in a single
taxable year. Accordingly, if a U.S. Holder realizes a loss on any Note (or, possibly, aggregate losses
from the Notes) satisfying such thresholds, the U.S. Holder could be required to file an information
return with the IRS, and failure to do so may subject the U.S. Holder to penalties. Prospective
purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to the
acquisition, holding or disposition of Notes.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. Holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” that meet certain U.S. dollar
thresholds are generally required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their
tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. U.S.
Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes.

**THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT**
**MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD**
**CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE**
**NOTES UNDER THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.**

## Certain ERISA Considerations

Unless otherwise indicated, the Notes should be eligible for purchase by Plans (as defined below)
subject to certain considerations of the issues described in this section. The following is a summary of
certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes by (a) an “employee
benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (b) a “plan” (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code), such as an individual retirement account and other arrangement,
that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code and (c) entities whose underlying assets include “plan
assets” (within the meaning of United States Department of Labor Regulation 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (“Plan Assets”)) of such employee benefit
plans, plans, accounts or other arrangements (each of clauses (a), (b) and (c) above, an “ERISA Plan”).
Employee benefit plans that are “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain
“church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and non-U.S.
plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code;
however, such plans may be subject to non-U.S., federal, state or local laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”) or which otherwise affect their ability to invest in the Notes
(together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”). Any fiduciary of such a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan
considering an investment in the Notes should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the
availability of, any exemptive relief under such laws or regulations.

### General Fiduciary Matters 

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of ERISA Plans and prohibit
certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested
parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control
over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such
an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect)
with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA
Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment
is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and ERISA, Section 4975 of
the Code or any Similar Law.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee,
the Security Trustee, the registrars, the agents and their respective affiliates (collectively, the
“Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide
investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary
capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications,
correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to
be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not
constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The
decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan
purchaser on an arm’s length basis.


-----

### Prohibited Transaction Issues 

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving Plan Assets with persons or entities having certain relationships to such plans,
who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,”
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest
or a disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, the fiduciary
of an ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of
Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party is considered a party in interest
or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance
with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable. Included among these are exemptions under
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a
person that is a party in interest (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that has or exercises
discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice with respect to assets involved in the
transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the plan, provided that there is adequate
consideration for the transaction), Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to
investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions determined
by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance
company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled
separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by in-house asset managers).
There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available
with respect to any particular transaction involving any Notes.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing Plan
Assets, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
violation of any Similar Laws.

### Representation and Warranty

Accordingly, by acceptance of any Notes or interest therein, each purchaser and subsequent
transferee will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that (X) either (i) it is not, and
is not acting on behalf of, a Plan, and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to
acquire or hold the Notes or any interest therein constitutes assets of a Plan or (ii) the acquisition,
holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or any interest therein will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or, in the case of a governmental plan, a church plan, non-U.S. or other
plan, a violation of any Similar Laws, and (Y) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any
interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same
representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such Notes
or any interest therein.

Each purchaser and transferee that is, or is acting on behalf of, an ERISA Plan, will be further deemed
to represent, warrant and agree that (1) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment
recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the
assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its
decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as
defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan


-----

Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Notes and (2) the Plan Fiduciary is
exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in nonexempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons
considering whether to purchase the Notes (and hold the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of,
any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable.

## Plan of Distribution

Under the terms and conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement entered into between the
Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed
to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have, severally and not jointly,
agreed to purchase the principal amount of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers of the Notes are
Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities Europe SA and Citigroup Global
Markets Europe AG.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligation of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Notes
is subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The Initial Purchasers must
purchase all the Notes if any are purchased.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their controlling persons against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act. The Issuer has been advised that the Initial
Purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this
Offering Memorandum. The price at which the Notes are offered may be changed at any time
without notice. Initial Purchasers that are not U.S. registered broker dealers may make offers and
sales into the United States if any, only through their U.S. registered broker dealer.

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefore on or about, 2023 which will
be the ninth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred
to as “T+9”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally
are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next six
business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in T+9, to specify
an alternate settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of
the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next six business days should
consult their own advisors.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. Application has
been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Lux SE and to trading on the Euro MTF
Market. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the
market after the Offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading
market for the Notes will develop and continue after the Offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised
the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers
are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any market making activities with respect to a
tranche of Notes at any time without notice. In addition, market making activity will be subject to the
limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot make any
assurance that a liquid market will develop for a tranche of Notes, that any purchaser will be able to
sell its Notes at a particular time or that the prices that a purchaser receives when it sells will be
favorable.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than the Issuer
and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections afforded to
its clients nor for providing advice in relation to the Offering.

Buyers of the Notes sold by the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the initial
offering price set forth on the cover of this Offering Memorandum.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions
and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act.

Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the
relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security


-----

so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve
purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a
broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker-dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or
covering transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These
transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial
advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates have performed and may perform in
the future various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services (including
hedging transactions) from time to time for the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of
business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. In addition,
in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for
the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities
and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the Notes).

Each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates is a lender under the Issuer Syndicated
Facilities Agreement. In addition, some of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are
lenders under the Schaeffler Group Revolving Facility. Furthermore, the Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates may and/or do provide additional credit lines to the Schaeffler Group from time
to time. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received and/or will receive
customary fees for their services in such capacities.

It is likely that certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates will hedge their credit
exposure. Typically, they would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities,
including potentially the notes offered in the Offering. Any such credit default swaps or short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered in the Offering. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments
and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such
securities and instruments (including the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of
such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire,
long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. It and the Initial Purchasers also
reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason or no
reason and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the full amount of the Notes sought by it.
The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities may acquire, for their own
accounts, a portion of the Notes.

## Transfer Restrictions

You are hereby advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other
transfer of any of the Notes offered in the Offering.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below. By purchasing Notes, you will
be deemed to have made the following acknowledgements, representations to and agreements with
us and the Initial Purchasers:

(i) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities
laws and are being offered for resale in transactions that do not require registration under
the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws; and

(b) unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except
under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (v) and (vi) below.

(ii) You acknowledge that this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act and may not comply in important respects with SEC
rules that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering of securities.

(iii) You represent that you are not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act)
of ours, that you are not acting on our behalf and that either:

(a) you are a “qualified institutional buyer” (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act) and are purchasing Notes for your own account or for the account of another qualified
institutional buyer, and you are aware that the Initial Purchasers are selling the Notes to
you in reliance on Rule 144A; or

(b) you are not a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) or

(iv) You acknowledge that none of we, the Initial Purchasers or any person representing us or the
Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to you with respect to us or the offering of the
Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Accordingly, you
acknowledge that no representation or warranty is made by the Initial Purchasers or any person
representing the Initial Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. You
represent that you are relying only on this Offering Memorandum in making your investment
decision with respect to the Notes. You agree that you have had access to such financial and
other information concerning us and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection
with your decision to purchase Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request
information from us and the Initial Purchasers.

(v) You represent that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more
investor accounts for which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case not with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution of the Notes in violation of the U.S.
Securities Act or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition
of your property or the property of that investor account or accounts be at all times within your
or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A,
Regulation S or any other available exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.
You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are
purchasing Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance of the Notes will


-----

agree, that until the end of the Resale Restriction Period (as defined below), the Notes may be
offered, sold or otherwise transferred only:

(a) to us or any of our subsidiaries;

(b) under a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities
Act;

(c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person the seller
reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that is purchasing for its own account
or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer and to whom notice is given that
the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) through offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the
meaning of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act; or

(e) under any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act,

subject, in each of the above cases, to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s
property or the property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller’s or
account’s control, and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable
local laws and regulations.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global
note, the Resale Restriction Period may continue until one year after the Issuer, or any affiliate
of the Issuer, was the owner of such note or held an interest in such global note, and so may
continue indefinitely.

(vi) You also acknowledge that:

(a) the above restrictions on resale will apply from the closing date until the date that is one
year (in the case of Rule 144A Notes) after the later of the closing date, the closing date of
the issuance of any additional Notes and the last date that we or any of our affiliates was
the owner of the Notes or any predecessor of the Notes or 40 days (in the case of
Regulation S Notes) after the later of the closing date and when the Notes or any
predecessor of the Notes are first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in
Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S (the “Resale Restriction Period”), and
will not apply after the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends;

(b) we and the Trustee reserve the right to require, in connection with any offer, sale or other
transfer of Notes under clause (v)(d) or (v)(e) above, the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and the Trustee; and

(c) each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE

HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH
TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, SUCH REGISTRATION.

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND
ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR ACCOUNT FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED SECURITIES, TO OFFER,

COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM.
THE HOLDER AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS SECURITY IS
TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND. IN THE CASE
OF REGULATION S NOTES: BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER HEREOF REPRESENTS
THAT IT IS NOT A U.S. PERSON NOR IS IT PURCHASING FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A U.S. PERSON
AND IS ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE PROHIBITED TRANSACTION PROVISIONS OF SECTION
406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE (COLLECTIVELY, “SIMILAR LAWS”) (EACH OF (1),
(2), (3) AND (4) ABOVE A “PLAN”) OR (B) THE ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND DISPOSITION OF THIS
SECURITY OR ANY INTEREST HEREIN WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR RESULT IN A NON-EXEMPT
PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR,
IN THE CASE OF A GOVERNMENTAL PLAN, CHURCH PLAN, NON-U.S. OR OTHER PLAN, A
VIOLATION OF ANY SIMILAR LAWS AND (Y) IT WILL NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS

ERISA OR SECTION 4975(E)(3) OF THE CODE, TO THE ERISA PLAN OR THE PLAN FIDUCIARY IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ERISA PLAN’S ACQUISITION OF THE NOTES AND (2) THE PLAN
FIDUCIARY IS EXERCISING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING THE INVESTMENT

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(vii) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such Notes.

(viii) You are deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (X) either (a) you are not, are not acting
on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by you to acquire and hold such Notes or any

## Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities

The Issuer is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Germany. In addition, any future
providers of Collateral may also be organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. Most of the
members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Managing Directors of Schaeffler AG and many
of the directors and officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. As a result, it may
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or
such persons, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws or otherwise despite the fact that, pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, the Issuer has appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process
in New York, or to enforce, in original actions, liabilities against the Issuer based on those laws. In
addition, as many of the Issuer’s assets and the assets of its directors and executive officers are
located outside of the United States, Note Holders may be unable to enforce against them judgments
obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the Issuer has assets.

Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below
for Germany, investors should consult with their own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as
needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

Civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the Unites States may, either in an original
action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts, not be enforceable in Germany.
The enforceability of U.S. judgments in Germany is subject to an action to be brought before a
German court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the procedures set forth by the German
Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). The United States and Germany do not currently have
a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration
awards, in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered
by a federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, may not be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in
Germany.

Notwithstanding, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United
States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws,
would generally be recognized by a German court upon a number of factors, including the following:

(a) U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles on jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

(b) the document introducing the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely
manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such
requirements, (i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless
appeared in the proceedings;

(c) the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior
judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is to be recognized in
Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment is not in contradiction to
proceedings in Germany that have become pending earlier;


-----

(d) the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law,
including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of the Federal Republic
of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that in the past the recognition
and enforcement of any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding
punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as
treble damages, has been denied by German courts. They are regarded to be in conflict with
material principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent they are necessary
to compensate actual losses or damages;

(e) the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

(f) the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was
pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants
after having received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with
the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in
Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there
can be no assurance that those judgments will be enforceable. In particular, the obligations need to
be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law.
Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of
aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the
laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by
which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse
or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in
the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.
