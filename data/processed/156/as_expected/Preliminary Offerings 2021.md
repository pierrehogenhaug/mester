The materials relating to this offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer
or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires
that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and an Initial Purchaser or any affiliate of an

by such Initial Purchaser or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuers (as defined in the offering memorandum)

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents

**Professional investors and ECPs only target market:** Solely for the purposes of the product approval
process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Securities is eligible counterparties (‘‘ECPs’’) and
professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU; and (ii) all channels for distribution of
such Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending such Securities (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Securities (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the
purposes of this provision, the term ‘‘manufacturers’’ shall mean such of the Joint Global Coordinators and


-----

Joint Bookrunners and Joint Sustainability-Linked Bond Structuring Advisors (as listed in the offering
memorandum) as are subject to the product governance rules under MiFID II.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Securities is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (‘‘COBS’’) and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (‘‘UK MiFIR’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Securities to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such Securities (for the purposes of this provision, a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of such Securities (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the
purposes of this provision, the term ‘‘manufacturers’’ shall mean such of the Joint Global Coordinators and
Joint Bookrunners as are subject to the product governance rules under COBS and UK MiFIR.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors:** The Securities are not intended to be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of the
following: (a) ‘‘retail client’’ as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (b) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the
Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Prohibition of sales to United Kingdom retail investors:** The Securities are not intended to be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is on (or more)
of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the ‘‘UK PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Securities
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Guarantors’ or the Target Companies’ business, financial condition or other information contained in this
offering memorandum may change after the date hereof. Neither the delivery of this offering
memorandum at any time after the date of publication nor any subsequent commitment to purchase the

United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by beneficial
interests in one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’).

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS**

**United States**

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any other
regulatory authority has reviewed or approved or disapproved of the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and
none of the foregoing authorities have passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offering or the accuracy
or adequacy of this offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense under
the laws of the United States and could be a criminal offense in certain other jurisdictions.

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this offering memorandum under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The
Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state
of the United States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer. Prospective purchasers are hereby
notified that the seller of any note may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the
Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer
of the Notes, see ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

**Canada**

This offering memorandum constitutes an ‘‘exempt offering document’’ as defined in and for the purposes
of applicable Canadian securities laws. No prospectus has been filed with any securities commission or
similar regulatory authority in Canada in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes. No securities
commission or similar regulatory authority in Canada has reviewed or in any way passed upon this
document or on the merits of the Notes and any representation to the contrary is an offence.

The Notes may be sold only to Canadian purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are ‘‘accredited investors’’, as such term is defined in Section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106
Prospectus Exemptions or, in Ontario, as such term is defined in Section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act
(Ontario), and are ‘‘permitted clients’’, as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103
Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Each Canadian purchaser
who purchases the Notes will be deemed to have represented to the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers and to
each dealer from whom a purchase confirmation is received, as applicable, that the purchaser (i) is
purchasing as principal, or is deemed to be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian
securities laws, for investment only and not with a view to resale or redistribution; (ii) is an ‘‘accredited
investor’’; and (iii) is a ‘‘permitted client’’.

Any resale of Notes acquired by a Canadian purchaser in the Offering must be made in accordance with
applicable Canadian securities laws, which may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may
require resales to be made in accordance with Canadian prospectus requirements, a statutory exemption
from the prospectus requirements, in a transaction exempt from the prospectus requirements or otherwise
under a discretionary exemption from the prospectus requirements granted by the applicable local
Canadian securities regulatory authority. These resale restrictions may under certain circumstances apply
to resales of the Notes outside of Canada.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser
within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The
purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province
or territory for particulars of these rights, or consult with a legal advisor.

Canadian purchasers are advised that this document has been prepared in reliance on Section 3A.3 of
National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (‘‘NI 33-105’’). Pursuant to section 3A.3 of NI 33-105,
this document is exempt from the requirement that the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers in the Offering
provide Canadian purchasers with certain conflicts of interest disclosure pertaining to ‘‘connected issuer’’
and/or ‘‘related issuer’’ relationships as would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 2.1(1) of
NI 33-105.

Upon receipt of this offering memorandum, each Canadian purchaser hereby confirms that it has expressly
requested that all documents evidencing or relating in any way to the sale of the Notes described herein
(including for greater certainty any purchase confirmation or any notice) be drawn up in the English
language only. Par la r´eception de ce document, chaque investisseur Canadien confirme par les pr´esentes qu’il

**European Economic Area**

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, ‘‘retail investor’’
means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) ‘‘retail client’’ as defined in point (11) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); or (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Securities or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of
the EEA that is subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
14 June 2017 (as amended, the ‘‘Prospectus Regulation’’) will be made pursuant to an exemption under
the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.

**_MiFID II Product Governance_**

Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product approval
process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in the
offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible
counterparties (‘‘ECPs’’) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term ‘‘manufacturers’’ shall mean such of the
Joint Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners as are subject to the product governance rules under
MiFID II.

**United Kingdom**

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (‘‘UK’’). For these purposes,
‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is on (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (‘‘EUWA’’); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (‘‘FSMA’’) and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part
of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the
PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the ‘‘UK PRIIPs
**Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in**
the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.

-----

**_UK MiFIR Product Governance_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the securities described in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct
of Business Sourcebook (‘‘COBS’’) and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as
it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (‘‘UK MiFIR’’); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (for the purposes of this provision, a
‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term ‘‘manufacturers’’ shall mean such of the
Joint Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners as are subject to the product governance rules under
COBS and UK MiFIR.

**Switzerland**

The Notes may not be publicly offered, sold or advertised, directly or indirectly, in or into Switzerland
within the meaning of the Swiss Financial Services Act (‘‘FinSA’’), except under the following exemptions
under the FinSA:

(i) to any investor that qualifies as a professional client within the meaning of the FinSA; and

(ii) in any other circumstances falling within art. 36 of the FinSA;

_provided, in each case, that no such offer of Notes referred to in (i) and (ii) above shall require the_
publication of a prospectus for offers of Notes pursuant to the FinSA.

The Notes have not and will not be listed or admitted to trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange or on any
other trading venue (exchange or multilateral trading facility) in Switzerland.

Neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Offering,
the Notes or the Issuers constitutes a prospectus as such term is understood pursuant to the FinSA, and
neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Offering,
the Notes or the Issuers may be distributed or otherwise made available in Switzerland in an manner which
would require the publication of a prospectus in Switzerland pursuant to the FinSA. Neither this offering
memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Offering, the Notes or the
Issuers have been or will be filed with or approved by any review body (Pr¨ufstelle) or other Swiss regulatory
authority.

**Luxembourg**

This offering memorandum has not been approved by and will not be submitted for approval to (i) the
Luxembourg financial sector regulator (the _Commission de surveillance du secteur financier) for the_
purposes of a public offering or sale in Luxembourg, of the Notes or admission to the official list of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (‘‘LxSE’’) and trading on the LxSE’s regulated market of the Notes or to
(ii) the LxSE for the purposes of admitting the Notes to the official list of the LxSE and trading on the
LxSE’s Euro MTF market (the ‘‘Euro MTF Market’’). Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold
to the public in Luxembourg, directly or indirectly, or listed or traded on the LxSE’s regulated market or
the Euro MTF Market, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other circular, prospectus, form of
application, advertisement or other material may be distributed, or otherwise made available in or from, or
published in, Luxembourg except in circumstances which do not constitute a public offer of securities to
the public subject to prospectus requirements in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation and the
Luxembourg act of July 16, 2019 on prospectuses for securities.

**FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about market
consolidation and our strategy, investment program, future operations, prospects, growth, goals, targets,
industry forecasts, expected acquisitions, transactions and investments, and target levels of liquidity,
leverage and indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or
forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs,
plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact.
Words or phrases such as ‘‘aim,’’ ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘assume,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘continue,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’
‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘forecast,’’ ‘‘guidance,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘ongoing,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘predict,’’ ‘‘project,’’
‘‘seek,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘target,’’ ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘would’’ or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or
phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily
mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and
are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially
from those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in
‘‘Risk Factors.’’ In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or
developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from
projected future results include, but are not limited to:

- adverse and uncertain global and regional economic conditions;

- operating within a highly competitive industry, including the resulting pricing pressure on our
business;

- our ability to implement our business strategies;

- our ability to achieve the targeted benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures;

- volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials;

- disruption in our supplier relationships;

- cyclicality in the chemicals industry;

- the outbreak of Covid-19 and its global economic impact;

- our ability to execute future acquisitions and deliver the anticipated benefits thereof;

- concentration of revenues among a limited number of product groups and customers;

- our exposure to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks;

- risks related to our international operations;

- operational risks associated with manufacturing;

- compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the retention of requisite
permits related to our operations;

- ongoing costs and regulations related to contamination or exposure impacts from our operations or
products;

- our ability to maintain compliance with chemical safety regulations;

- delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and changes in rules and regulations;

- the loss of key customers;

- non-payment or non-performance of contracts by our customers;

- our limited control of joint ventures and other similar business arrangements;

- economic developments in the EU, including with regards to Brexit;

- legal disputes and government proceedings;

- our ability to develop new, commercially viable products;

viii


-----

- our ability to adjust our products or technologies to address our customers’ changing requirements or
competitive challenges in a timely manner;

- the occurrence of major operational interruptions or problems at our facilities;

- our ability to attract, hire, train and retain experienced management and personnel;

- antitrust regulation and related enforcement actions and damage claims;

- our reliance on complex information technology systems and networks that are subject to the risk of
disruption and security breaches;

- the sufficiency of our insurance coverage and increases to our insurance premiums;

- our dependence on good relationships with our employees;

- our substantial pension and other similar employee benefits-related obligations, including the
development of these obligations and related funding requirements;

- impairment of the value of brand names or other intangible assets;

- exposure to additional tax liabilities;

- risks related to the Transactions, our capital structure and the Notes; and

- other factors discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors.’’

These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors
that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity and developments in
the markets and industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not
possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the
extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
actual results. We urge you to read this entire offering memorandum, including the sections entitled, ‘‘Risk
_Factors’’, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’,_
‘‘Industry’’ and ‘‘Business’’ for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future
performance and the industry in which we operate.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum, and we do not
intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this offering
memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering
memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We operate in the microbial control solutions industry and in number of other specialty chemicals
industries. In certain cases, it is difficult in this sector to obtain precise market, economic and industry
information. Certain information used in this offering memorandum has been obtained from the Boston
Consulting Group and other third party and our analysis and estimates.

Some of the information herein has also been extrapolated from market data, reports, surveys and studies
using our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this offering memorandum, statements
regarding the industry in which we operate, our position in this industry and the size of certain markets are
based solely on our experience, internal studies, estimates and surveys, and our own investigation of
market conditions.

None of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers accepts responsibility for the factual
correctness of any such statistics or information obtained from third parties. While we believe this
information to be reliable, it has not been independently verified, and we do not make any representation
or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum.
Some of the forward-looking statements contained in such industry and market data were made prior to
the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and have not been fully updated to account for the impact of
such outbreak. There can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have been
materially different if the COVID-19 pandemic had been taken into account. See _‘‘Forward Looking_

_Statements.’’ Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not_
necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself
is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including
judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market.
Additionally, industry publications and reports from management consultants generally state that the
information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the
accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do
not assume liability for such information. We cannot therefore assure you of the accuracy and
completeness of such information as we have not independently verified such information.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

We own or have rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that we use in connection with
the operation of our business. We assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our
trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**The Issuers**

The Issuers were incorporated on January 28, 2021 to facilitate the Transactions. As of the date of this
offering memorandum, the Issuers had no material assets or liabilities, did not have any revenuegenerating activities of their own and had not engaged in activities other than those related to their
incorporation and in preparation of the Transactions. As a result, no historical financial information of the
Issuers is included in this offering memorandum.

**LSI Business**

The LSI Business has been, and as at the date of this offering memorandum remains, part of Lonza Group.
It has not historically existed as a separate reporting group, but rather formed part of a larger Lonza
Group of companies. In prior years, the LSI Business was reported as a separate ‘‘Specialty Ingredients’’
segment in the relevant consolidated financial statements of Lonza Group. In order to facilitate the
Acquisition, all companies and operating activities that are part of LSI Business were carved out of Lonza
Group (the ‘‘Carve-out’’) as part of the divestment of the LSI Business. During the year ended
December 31, 2020, Lonza Group substantially completed the Carve-out by (i) implementing operational
changes to separate key functions, including supply chain activities, customer facing roles and other critical
functions; and (ii) establishing certain additional legal entities to facilitate the organizational and legal
aspects of the Carve-out.

**Historical Financial Information**

As the LSI Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating activities
within the LSI Business were under the common control of Lonza Group, in each case, prior to the
finalization of the Carve-out, the historical financial information of the LSI Business presented in this
offering memorandum as at and for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 has been
prepared on a combined and carve-out basis.

As a result, this offering memorandum presents the following financial information of the LSI Business
(the ‘‘Financial Statements’’):

- The audited combined and carve-out financial statements of the LSI Business as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2019, together with notes thereto (the ‘‘2019 Financial Statements’’) and the
audit report thereon, which include comparative numbers as at and for the year ended December 31,
2018.

- The audited combined and carve-out financial statements of the LSI Business as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2020, together with notes thereto (the ‘‘2020 Financial Statements’’, and
together with the 2019 Financial Statements, the ‘‘Financial Statements’’) and the audit report
thereon, which include comparative numbers as at and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The Financial Statements exclude, for all relevant years, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of
Lonza Group’s ‘‘Consumer Health & Nutrition’’ and ‘‘Water Care’’ businesses, which were both previously
part of the ‘‘Specialty Ingredients’’ segment of Lonza Group. The ‘‘Consumer Health & Nutrition’’
business was transferred from the LSI Business to the Lonza Pharma Biotech & Nutrition (‘‘LPBN’’)
segment of Lonza Group effective as at January 1, 2019. However, certain assets, liabilities and results of
operations of a small portfolio of the legacy ‘‘Consumer Health & Nutrition’’ business, which are related to
the core LSI Business activities, were not transferred and are included in the Financial Statements. The
‘‘Water Care’’ business was sold by Lonza Group on February 28, 2019 to Platinum Equity and was
reported as discontinued operations in Lonza Group’s financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

The consolidated financial information of Lonza Group has not been included in this offering
memorandum.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of our business, the
terms of the Offering and the financial information presented in this offering memorandum.

xv


-----

**Basis of Preparation**

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), reflecting the fact
that the LSI Business has been carved-out from the larger Lonza Group. See Note 1 ‘‘Accounting Principles
_and Basis of Preparation’’ to the 2020 Financial Statements._

The preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. IFRS also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant, are disclosed in the Financial Statements. IFRS differs in
various respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’). We
have not prepared a reconciliation of our financial information to U.S. GAAP or a summary of significant
differences in the accounting and valuation methods of IFRS and U.S. GAAP and do not intend to do so
in the future. Potential investors should therefore consult their own professional advisors for an
understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP.

As IFRS does not provide guidelines for the preparation of combined and carve-out financial statements,
the preparation of the Financial Statements was subject to IAS 8 ‘‘Accounting Policies, Changes in
_Accounting Estimates and Errors,’’ particularly IAS 8.12, which required management of Lonza Group to_
consider recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements
and recognized industry practices in connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements.
Accordingly, in preparing the Financial Statements, the LSI Business applied Lonza Group’s accounting
approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business combinations under
common control. In general, the LSI Business used the same accounting policies and measurement
principles in preparing the Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial
statements of Lonza Group (the ‘‘extraction approach’’). This approach has been adjusted with respect to
transactions with Lonza Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS. Transactions between the
LSI Business and Lonza Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party
transactions as defined in IAS 24 ‘‘Related Party Disclosures.’’

In the year ended December 31, 2020, Lonza Group reallocated certain assets and liabilities between its
continuing business and the LSI Business, resulting in certain changes to the asset and liability allocations
to the LSI Business in the carve-out approach applied in the preparation of the 2019 Financial Statements.
These revised allocations were presented to enhance comparability and were reflected in the 2020
Financial Statements, including in the comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31,
2019. See Note 1.2 to the 2020 Financial Statements. Accordingly, figures as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 included in the 2020 Financial Statements may differ from those included in the 2019
Financial Statements. Figures in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31,
2019 have been extracted or derived from the comparative figures as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 included in the 2020 Financial Statements.

Additional information on the scope and basis of preparation of the Financial Statements and the
application of significant accounting policies is presented in Note 1 ‘‘Accounting Principles and Basis of
_Preparation’’ to the 2020 Financial Statements._

As a result, the Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum may not reflect what the
results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the LSI Business operated as a
separate, stand-alone business without the shared resources of Lonza Group for the years presented, and
may not be indicative of our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The fact that
the companies and operating activities comprising the LSI Business did not historically exist as a separate
group limits the validity of the combined and carve-out financial information.

**IFRS 16 (Leases)**

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), which replaced IAS 17 and the related IFRIC
and SIC interpretations and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the
distinction between operating and finance leases was eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee
recognizes an asset (the right-to-use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The
only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases should a company elect to apply an available practical
expedient in order to reduce the transition effort. IFRS 16 became effective for fiscal years commencing
on or after January 1, 2019.

xvi


-----

The LSI Business adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on January 1, 2019, by using the modified retrospective
method, which means that the cumulative transition effects of initial applications are recognized in
retained earnings as at January 1, 2019. The LSI Business elected to use the transition practical expedient
allowing the standard to be applied only to contracts that were previously identified as leases applying
IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 as at the date of initial application. Accordingly, no adjusted comparative information
was disclosed.

The transition to IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As a result,
figures as at and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 may not be comparable to the results
presented for prior periods. As at December 31, 2019 and 2020, our right-of-use assets (presented in
property, plant and equipment) amounted to CHF15 million and CHF14 million, respectively, and lease
liabilities amounted to CHF15 million and CHF14 million, respectively. The depreciation of right-of-use
assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, amounted to CHF5 million and CHF4 million,
respectively, and the interest expenses from lease liabilities amounted to CHF1 million and CHF1 million,
respectively.

The adoption of IFRS 16 had a positive impact on our Adjusted EBITDA, as the cost of operating leases
that were previously expensed above Adjusted EBITDA are now moved below Adjusted EBITDA and
included in depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest expense.

For an analysis of the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (Leases) from January 1, 2019, see
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting
_Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Changes to accounting standards—IFRS 16 (Leases)’’ and_
Note 1 ‘‘Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation’’ to the 2020 Financial Statements.

Aside from IFRS 16, the adoption of the other accounting standards in any year ended December 31, 2018,
2019 or 2020 did not have any significant impact on the Financial Statements.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information**

This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited _pro forma financial information of the SUN_
Issuer as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020, including pro forma indebtedness, pro forma senior
secured indebtedness and _pro forma interest expense, which has been prepared to illustrate the effect of_
the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on December 31, 2020, for the purposes of
calculating pro forma indebtedness and pro forma senior secured indebtedness and (ii) on January 1, 2020,
for the purposes of calculating pro forma interest expense. The pro forma financial information as at and
for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not
represent what our indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on
December 31, 2020 or January 1, 2020, respectively; nor does it purport to project our financial results,
indebtedness or interest expense at any future date.

The _pro forma financial information as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has not been_
prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards or in accordance
with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or any other
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other regulator. Neither the
assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information as at and for the
year ended December 31, 2020 have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted
auditing standards.

The unaudited adjustments and the unaudited _pro forma financial data set forth in this offering_
memorandum are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe
are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts. These pro forma measures are
not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures used by other companies.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

**_General_**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of
the Financial Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary non-IFRS financial measures used in this
offering memorandum include currency-adjusted sales to third parties, gross profit margin, Adjusted

xvii


-----

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of Carveout Adjustments,
Microbial Control Solutions Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of Carveout Adjustments, Specialty
Chemical Services Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of Carveout Adjustments, capital expenditures,
maintenance capital expenditure, growth capital expenditure, operational expenditures, trade net working
capital, change in trade net working capital, operating net working capital, change in operating net working
capital, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA margin and _pro forma Adjusted_
EBITDA, and other figures for the year ended December 31, 2020 (our ‘‘Non-IFRS Measures’’). These
measures are presented in this offering memorandum because they are measures that our management
uses to assess our operating performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in
our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and
because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by
excluding the distorting effect of certain non-operational, non-recurring or exceptional items.

For an explanation and reconciliation of certain of these Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly
comparable IFRS measure, see ‘‘Summary—Summary Financial and Other Information—Other Financial,
_Operating and Pro Forma Information.’’_

Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows:

**_Currency-adjusted sales to third_**
**_parties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** Means the currency-adjusted basis sales amounts, percentages and
variances which are calculated using the average monthly foreign
exchange rate of the same period in the prior year and applying that
rate to the actual monthly foreign currency sales amounts in the
applicable period. The monthly amounts are then aggregated to
display the full-year currency-adjusted basis sales figures. This is done
in order to enhance the comparability of our sales to third parties, and
such figures are presented using a constant exchange rate across
periods presented.

**_Gross profit margin . . . . . . . . . ._** Means gross profit as a percentage of sales to third parties.

**_Adjusted EBITDA . . . . . . . . . . ._** Means profit for the period, as adjusted by adding back income taxes,
share of loss/(profit) of associates and financial expenses less financial
income and adding back depreciation of property, plant and
equipment, amortization of intangible assets and impairment and
reversal of impairment on property, plant and equipment and
intangibles.

**_Adjusted EBITDA margin . . . . . ._** Means Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales to third parties.

**_Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal_**
**_of Carveout Adjustments . . . . ._** Means Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting the reversal of carveout
adjustments originally made to allocate certain costs, primarily
corporate overhead function costs, of the Lonza Group to the LSI
Business. These adjustments, which are further explained in Note 1.3
Basis of Preparation to the 2020 Financial Statements, were necessary
to reflect the fact that the LSI Business has been carved out from the
larger Lonza Group. The allocated costs may not be indicative of the
actual expenses that would have been incurred had the LSI Business
been operating as a separate entity apart from Lonza Group.

**_Microbial Control Solutions_**
**_Adjusted EBITDA After_**
**_Reversal of Carveout_**
**_Adjustments . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** Means Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of Carveout Adjustments
for our Microbial Control Solutions business unit.

**_Specialty Chemical Services_**
**_Adjusted EBITDA After_**
**_Reversal of Carveout_**
**_Adjustments . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** Means Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of Carveout Adjustments
for our Specialty Chemical Services business unit.

-----

**_Capital expenditures . . . . . . . . . ._** Means the investments in property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets in the period.

**_Maintenance capital expenditure . ._** Means capital expenditure related to ensuring current production
levels, efficiency, cost improvements, health and safety and
compliance.

**_Growth capital expenditure . . . . ._** Means capital expenditure related to increasing production capacity
and sales.

We present Non-IFRS Measures for informational purposes only. This information does not purport to
represent the results we would have achieved had any of the transactions for which an adjustment is made
occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or as of the dates indicated. Our Non-IFRS Measures
and ratios may not reflect accurately all aspects of our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt
and are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS, U.S. GAAP, SEC requirements or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to
performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, SEC requirements or any
other generally accepted accounting principles. The Non-IFRS Measures contained in this offering
memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC, will not be subject
to review by the SEC and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or
filed with the SEC. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or
verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of
operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies
and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for

xix

analysis of our operating results or cash flows as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of
Non-IFRS Measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
income statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;

- other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures; and

- each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this offering memorandum
is defined and calculated differently from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated Net Income’’ and
‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ presented in the sections entitled ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’of this offering memorandum and in the Indentures. Accordingly,
the EBITDA-based measures presented in this offering memorandum do not provide precise
indications as to the level of our adherence to the terms of the Indentures.

Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on
the Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement evaluation of our
performance.

**_Guarantor Coverage Information_**

This offering memorandum includes certain information with respect to the relative proportion of our total
assets, sales to third parties and EBITDA represented by Notes Guarantees provided by the Guarantors

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the following are among our key competitive strengths:

**_Fundamental macro trends driving growth across highly attractive end markets_**

Our business focuses on highly attractive end markets that offer significant structural growth potential. We
operate in profitable niche markets within the high-growth microbial control market and attractive niches
within the specialty chemical services market.

The biocides market is supported by a broad range of global trends driving underlying growth across
diversified application areas, such as our customers’ shift to more complex formulated products in
response to consumer preferences and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. It also benefits from
supportive demand as a result of the critical functions that biocides serve for our customers and their end
customers, which has been further evidenced by the increasing demand for our products due to changing
customer preferences induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in our Hygiene market field. The
Covid-19 pandemic has increased the need for protection of health and well-being and is creating a ‘‘new
normal’’ in the use of disinfectants, requiring us to stay ahead of the curve, defining and supporting the
‘‘new normal’’ and providing us with a significant opportunity, as well as with the responsibility for
educating customers and the public given our market leading position. Megatrends such as the growing
global population and, in particular, middle class, urbanization and rising living standards and other trends
such as changing lifestyles, increasing focus on the environment, safeguarding people’s wellbeing and
increasing regulation are aligned in favor of the Microbial Control Solutions business unit’s strengths,
creating attractive growth opportunities. In particular, the biocides market requires substantial research
and development investment and is a highly regulated market with lengthy registration processes and
regulatory reviews. We believe that our experience and expertise in this area would be difficult for new

3


-----

entrants to replicate. Our Microbial Control Solutions business unit is particularly well positioned to
navigate these processes and reviews to capitalize on favorable underlying consumer demand.

Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit is active in high-growth niches, such as composites. We have
a pipeline of innovative products in Specialty Chemical Services, including composite materials and
services related to our CDMO market field (sodium batteries, vegan collagen for cosmetics and nutrition,
other nutritional fermented products, and fragrances ingredients).

**_Leading and defendable market positions across an attractive and diversified product portfolio_**

We have well established, leading market positions supported by our attractive product and service
offerings to customers focused on formulation, coupled with a broad product offering and we believe that
this provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage. Further, we continuously evaluate our technical
capabilities, including R&D and manufacturing, to consider potential upgrades and to enable us to
maintain our leading market position and to meet market and customer needs.

Our Microbial Control Solutions business unit is a market leading business across a broad range of end
markets, with the most comprehensive portfolio of active and formulated solutions that provide
application-specific results for our customers. This scale allows us to have a broader end market presence
than any of our competitors across the microbial control industry, particularly in our Hygiene, Paints and
Coatings and Wood Protection market fields.

With 42 actives approved in the United States and 20 actives approved in the European Union, our
manufacturing of actives provides leading scale with the broadest active base in the market and in-house
production of quats and pyrithiones. Our formulated solutions offering is based upon our microbial labs
and research and development capabilities, extensive knowledge of end-use applications and access to our
proprietary registered formulations to our customers. This allows our customers to enter the market with
new products much quicker, avoiding regulatory approval processes of up to seven years and the collection
of relevant field data for specific markets of up to five years. While our customers need registrations to run
their own processes and to protect their products, they are generally not experts in the time-consuming
process of registering biocides.

Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit is focused on niches with high profitability and value
generation potential utilizing our highly specialized chemical and fermentation technologies. We provide
critical products and services to specialty end markets that are characterized by high resilience and provide
us with symbiotic relationships with our blue-chip customer base. In particular, we are a leader in Vitamin
B3 and a leading supplier of cyanate ester resins. We have a highly automated and efficient setup that
leverages complex chemistries and fermentation technologies across various end markets and use
innovative processes and systems focused on process development for exclusive synthesis projects of our
customers and for multi-customer products. Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit acts as a key
enabler for growth in our Microbial Control Solutions business unit and we are increasingly finding
applications of the processes developed in our Specialty Chemical Services business unit in the Microbial
Control Solutions business unit.

**_Diversified, long-standing and loyal customer base_**

We operate a service-focused business model that provides a broad range of formulation capabilities and
regulatory support and customized solutions. This has allowed us to form close relationships with many of
our customers that have often lasted for decades.

We provide a highly sophisticated specialty chemicals offering with R&D, process development, regulatory
support and innovation capabilities that can be tailored to our customers’ specific requirements, resulting
in a unique customer proposition. Our 13 R&D centers across the globe allow us to develop new products
to meet the needs of our customers, with the regional set-up of our R&D organization enabling us to
establish close links and a high degree of customer intimacy. In addition, through our technical service
offerings, we offer specialized solutions for customer technology and application specifications and are
able to facilitate end-consumer safety expectations. This close cooperation and the deep integration in our
customers’ value chain has resulted in high customer retention, with several having started more than
50 years ago with one of our key customers being served via a co-located pipeline directly from our
facilities. Our customer base is also diverse, with over 5,300 customers and our top 10 customers

accounting for only 34% of our sales to third parties in 2020. The chart below shows our sales to third
parties to our top 10 customers in 2020:

Our strong technical offering positions us well to address our customers’ continuous demands for
innovation and high-quality products. For example, our Hygiene market field was highly ranked in a survey
of our customers in the top key purchasing criteria for customers, including product quality, solution focus,
value for money, brand and reputation, innovation capabilities and existing relationships. In meeting these
key purchasing criteria, we are able to best serve our customer base and ensure long-term relationships
with our customers.

**_Industry-leading innovation platform and regulatory assurance expertise_**

We operate an innovative business proposition led by our regulatory assurance and research and
development capabilities. Our industry-leading regulatory assurance offering allows us to provide
customers with access to our portfolio of approved actives and team of regulatory specialists. Our research
and development organization has a regional footprint and application focus, with 13 R&D centers across
the globe putting us at the forefront of the sector’s innovation by anticipating and responding to market
developments. We also work with our customers on joint R&D, leveraging our technological capabilities
and unique regulatory expertise.

We consider our regulatory expertise and our significant portfolio of registered actives as a key
differentiator for our business. We have developed what we believe to be unmatched, market leading
regulatory expertise in highly regulated markets such as the European Union and the United States, with
75 regulatory specialists. This allows us to assist our customers through the complexities of various
regulatory processes across the globe and to proactively anticipate and address changes in the global
regulatory environment and to share this insight with our customers, allowing them to address regulatory
issues early in the product development processes. With our unique portfolio of registered actives in these
highly regulated markets we can assure our customers that the active and formulated solutions we provide
have already been approved, saving our customers both the time and cost associated with regulatory and
registration processes. Further, we anticipate that the introduction of new actives, such as biocides or
preservatives, will be a rare event in the industry going forward and that innovations will be focused on the
combination of existing registered actives and the documentation of their safe uses through registrations.
This regulatory expertise helps to drive and secure brand equity for our customers, reinforcing our strong
customer relationships.

We believe that our pipeline of innovative research and development projects generate attractive sales
potential driven by market and customer needs and a rigorous approach to optimize commercial success.
Our Microbial Control Solutions business unit’s R&D function has developed 36 new products in the past
three years, with 16 formulations approved by the EPA to combat the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The

development stages (12 in the planning phase, 26 in the feasibility phase, 39 in the development phase and
10 in the commercialization phase). We are positioned to anticipate and respond to market developments
and customer needs. Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit’s R&D is focused on process
development for multi-customer products with 13 new products launched in the past three years. Examples
of our long track record of commercializing our R&D capabilities include: the Lonzagard� portfolio,
Sodium Omadine� antimicrobial, Lonzagard� BKC cGMP, BARamine�, the Bardac� range of
antimicrobials, the NUGEN� EHP platform, Lonzagard� NAHS, Wipes Plus�, Tanasote� preservative,
Geogard Ultra�, the SYNETH� Range, NUGEN� MB5A, NUGEN� MB5N, Lonzagard� RCS and
Lonzagard� R-82. Our R&D function has contributed significantly to our sales growth over the years. We
estimate that 35% of our Microbial Control Solutions business unit’s 2020 sales to third parties and 32% of

-----

our Specialty Chemical Services business unit’s 2020 sales to third parties are attributable to innovations on
the combination of existing registered actives and new products from in-house R&D. Over the past three
years our R&D expenses totaled CHF50 million in 2018, CHF48 million in 2019 and CHF35 million in
2020, representing 2.9%, 2.8% and 2.1% of sales to third parties in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

**_Well-invested global manufacturing footprint, leveraging multiple technology platforms across the portfolio_**

Our global presence and a well-invested asset base allow us to provide our customers with valuable
benefits from our broad range of technology platforms and skill sets and flexibility in our manufacturing
setup.

We operate an asset-based, process-oriented and efficiency-driven specialty business, with Visp being our
main site of operations, along with other key facilities located in the United States, China and the Czech
Republic. Our unique setup in Visp with its highly automated Cracker Core and the hydrogen cyanide
(‘‘HCN’’) and Ketene/Diketene networks, is optimized towards high-value niches. The Visp site includes
five highly flexible multi-purpose plants for custom manufacturing of specialty chemicals for various
applications and two multi-product chemical plants mainly serving the Composite Materials market field of
our Specialty Chemical Services business unit.

With our global footprint of 18 manufacturing sites across EIMEA, APAC and the Americas we can meet
the specific needs of customers across the globe. Currently, the Microbial Control Solutions business unit
is focused on and has its strongest sales in the Americas, while the Specialty Chemical Services business
unit is focused on and has its strongest sales in Europe. Given the focus of the sales distribution of these
business units in the US and Europe, we believe that our operations in Asia present a growth area for both
of our business units. We believe that our global presence combined with regional expertise provides us
with a significant competitive advantage, ensuring local, physical proximity to clients, which is a key for
many of the Microbial Control Solutions market fields, such as the Wood Protection market.

capacity expansion of Primaset from 2018 to 2020, all at our Visp facility. We have also made significant
investments related to EHS, with our aggregate operational expenses on EHS concerns amounting to
CHF9 million, CHF11 million and CHF15 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
respectively, while our capital expenditures on EHS amounting to CHF20 million, CHF30 million and
CHF31 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Our operational setup for the Microbial Control Solutions business unit reflects the broad technology base
for actives and formulated products, allowing us to leverage our technology base across diverse end
markets. This provides a key competitive advantage in being able to combine our technology to support
differentiated and more targeted offerings while providing for lower costs. In addition, our broad
manufacturing and technology base allows us to backward integrate key products into our own active
ingredients and provides our business with a stable, resilient portfolio of actives allowing for good capital
utilization. Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit is able to provide lower costs and offer
differentiated and more targeted offerings to our customers through our unique expertise and
complementary combination of chemical and fermentation solutions, our highly automated cracker and
downstream plant setup at Visp, our fixed cost absorption and integrated production network and our best
practice and knowledge sharing with small and medium enterprises that are based in Visp. These
technology platforms enable us to provide valuable commercial benefits to our customers.

**_Attractive financial profile with strong cash flow generation_**

We have historically delivered resilient cash flows with growing sales to third parties (on a currencyadjusted basis), Normalized Adjusted EBITDA margin and cash conversion. In particular, our business
model, including our recent focus on directing our portfolio towards higher growth and higher margin
products, has proven its resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic, with strong performance in 2020.

Our diverse mix of products, end markets, customers and geographies results in stability through economic
and raw material cycles as demonstrated by our 2020 growth in sales to third parties of 3.5% on a constant
currency basis (decrease of 2.1% on an actual currency basis). We have a strong focus on continuous
operational improvements, for example our recent cost of goods sold improvement program that focused
on fixed cost reduction, alternative chemical routes, debottlenecking and variable cost reduction, and a
demonstrated pricing excellence as well as ability to pass through costs, driving our 2020 Normalized
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%. Our track record of delivering on productivity and operational
optimization opportunities has led to an attractive financial profile resulting in high cash conversion of
76.6% in 2020 (calculated as (i) Normalized Adjusted EBITDA _less capital expenditures_ _plus change in_
operating net working capital divided by (ii) Normalized Adjusted EBITDA). We believe that our business
has a significant opportunity to drive cost savings and increase profitability margins, particularly through
our new cost savings initiatives related to our Transformation Program and because, as a standalone
company, we will no longer be part of a more pharmaceutically oriented company.

We have a strong financial trajectory, underpinned by a clear portfolio strategy towards our high-margin
Microbial Control Solutions business unit and penetration of attractive Specialty Chemical Services niches.
We have clear strategies and initiatives to grow, optimize and protect our businesses with the Microbial
Control Solutions and Specialty Chemical Services business units, with increased focus on attractive
‘‘growth’’ businesses, such as the Hygiene market field. In particular, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic
and trends in consumer preferences, we expect that the Hygiene market field will continue to grow as
products in this market field continue to serve a critical function for customers. These growth businesses
offer high and sustainable growth rates with higher margins, which drives overall profitability.

**_Highly experienced management team, leading talented workforce and highly committed financial sponsors_**

We benefit from a strong and experienced management team, consisting of our senior management and
heads of certain corporate and business functions, with a proven track record in the specialty chemicals
markets and over 140 years of combined experience in the specialty chemicals industry. Our Chief
Operating Officer, Antje Gerber, joined LSI in 2019 and was appointed as COO in 2020, bringing
substantial experience from previous positions at Venator Materials (formerly Huntsman), HB Fuller and
Evonik. In addition to our management team, we have a lean and efficient organizational structure
powered by talent, expertise and a passion to create real value as a market leader supported by a
well-trained global workforce with high employee satisfaction reflected in long tenures, low turnover and
strong performance.

7


-----

We also benefit from the experience of our Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven, who each have a track
record in successful execution within similar environments and realizing cost savings, with 25 carve-out
transactions since 2010 and over 15 transactions in the chemicals and materials market. Bain Capital and
Cinven have also worked together previously, including on the 2017 public takeover of STADA, a leading
pharmaceuticals business, which they continue to own jointly.

**Our Strategies**

As a result of our recent carve-out from Lonza, the Acquisition and the resulting organizational changes
and strategy review, we are fully focused on delivering our growth strategy, which builds on four main
pillars:

**_Unlock growth_**

We are confident that we can unlock growth in our business through our numerous initiatives and are well
positioned to address and capitalize on current, fundamental market trends. These trends include
tightening regulatory landscapes, evolving customer preferences, increasing focus on the environment and
sustainability, increasing focus on safeguarding people and resources and growing end-customer base.

The tightening regulatory landscapes around the world, in particular in the United States and Europe, are
creating opportunities for us to utilize our regulatory expertise to grow our business. In particular, we
believe our Hygiene market field is well positioned for growth by expanding our complementary
formulation platform and supplemental registration model in North America and capitalizing on
significant upcoming BPR-related commercial opportunities in Europe.

Evolving customer preferences present opportunities for us to grow our business in new end markets. For
example, we are seeing an increased demand for low temperature laundry applications in Home and
Personal Care and have developed new products to address that market. Additionally, the implementation
of 5G telecommunications systems presents an opportunity for us to develop and market 5G-related
electronics applications within our Composites market field. Further, the increasing global focus on the
environment and sustainability has opened up new R&D-driven opportunities, particularly in our Paints
and Coatings market field, such as marine antifouling, and within our Composites market field for light
weight-related opportunities in aerospace applications. In addition, concerns about safeguarding people’s
wellbeing and resources is creating opportunities in Hygiene through forward integration of ingredients
into ready-to-use formulated solutions and in Wood Protection through demand for replacement
technologies that address environmental and regulatory concerns. For example, upcoming BPR regulations
in Europe will impact the production and use of creosote (which we do not produce) and we expect that
our substitute product, Tanasote, will be well positioned to address these upcoming regulations.

The growing middle class, particularly in South America, is leading to above average growth in consumer
related markets such as home and personal care and hygiene, and we have seen year-on-year growth in our
Microbial Control Solutions business unit in Latin America of greater than 42% in 2020. We expect growth
to continue in these markets and believe we are well positioned through our global manufacturing
footprint and our extensive R&D and regulatory capability to continue to address customer needs in these
markets.

**_Drive innovation_**

Our research and development operations are key to maintaining our sector-leading innovation and ability
to respond to market developments and customer needs and are a core component of our customer
offering. Our ability to anticipate and navigate the regulatory environments in key jurisdictions allows us to
commercialize our products. We have a full pipeline of innovation projects across market fields which we
manage rigorously through a stage-gated R&D process, which was implemented in 2020 to focus more on
market and customer driven innovations. This process aims to continuously evaluate projects to assess
their ability to deliver real value to our customers and ability to successfully make it to market.

Our innovation projects are driven by market and customer needs for applications that make a difference
and are a key driver of revenue growth, particularly for our Microbial Control Solutions business unit.
Many of our projects are joint R&D efforts with our customers, which are sometimes co-funded by our
customers. Some of our innovations use the capabilities of our cross-business unit network, for example,
the development and scale up of new antidandruff products by our Specialty Chemical Services business
unit for a customer need within our Microbial Control Solutions business unit. We expect to continue to

8


-----

invest in our R&D, maintaining similar levels of investment in R&D as in past years and to look for ways
to capitalize on cross-business unit capabilities to enhance our offerings.

Our ability to commercialize the knowledge we have from our years of regulatory experience sets us apart
from our competitors. We work closely with regulators throughout the entire development process to
ensure that we have solutions for upcoming regulatory challenges. We will continue to develop strong
relationships with key regulatory stakeholders and focus on and develop our regulatory expertise to
strengthen our customer relationships through joint projects with our customers.

**_Manage the portfolio_**

We will continue to focus on highly attractive end markets that offer significant structural growth potential
with an aim to expand our operations in profitable niche markets within the high-growth microbial control
market and attractive niches within the specialty chemical services market. We intend to utilize our
strengths in research and development and regulatory expertise to continue to develop and commercialize
new products for these end markets. We continue to actively manage our portfolio, with clear strategies for
each of the business units and market fields, particularly within our higher-growth businesses. We expect
these strategies will lead to topline and profitability increases going forward.

We are experiencing above-market growth rates in our Microbial Control Solutions business unit, which is
expected to exhibit strong underlying end-market growth of 4.3% CAGR over the period from 2019 to
2025, complemented by selected growth opportunities in other attractive market verticals. This market
growth is driven by a shift to more formulated and higher value products as a result of regulatory and
consumer preferences. Our strong R&D initiatives are particularly vital in our Hygiene, Home and
Personal Care, Paints and Coatings and Wood and Crop Protection market fields. We expect growth in end
markets served by our Hygiene market field, which accounted for 16% of our 2020 sales to third parties, to
be 9.1% over the period from 2019 to 2025 and to be largely driven by Covid-19 increasing the need for
protection of health creating a ‘‘new normal’’ in the use of disinfectants and a permanent shift to more
formulated and higher value products due to tightening regulatory landscapes. Growth in end markets
served by our Home and Personal Care market field, which accounted for 14% of our 2020 sales to third
parties, is expected to be 2.4% and is largely driven by increasing customer awareness of preservation
systems and smart formulations to reduce preservative concentrations and Covid-19 positively impacting
the home care market due to higher hygiene sensitivity and demand for cleanliness and germ-free
solutions. Growth in end markets served by our Wood Protection market field, which accounted for 19% of
our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be 3.5% and is largely driven by increasing popularity of wood
construction due to climate neutrality and sustainability and growth in North America due to higher usage
of wood in construction and greater variety in applications. Growth in end markets served by our Paints
and Coatings market field, which accounted for 7% of our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be
4.5% and is largely driven by positive sales mix-effect due to shifts from solvent-based paints to waterbased paints and increasing usage of high-performance paints in emerging markets. Growth in end markets
served by our Material Protection market field, which accounted for 6% of our 2020 sales to third parties,
is expected to be 4.2% and is largely driven by oil and gas exploration by fracking as well as the
fast-growing plastics industry.

For Specialty Chemical Services we are targeting steady GDP-linked growth, driven by fast growing niche
businesses, particularly in the Composite Materials and CDMO market fields. The strong growth in these
areas is largely driven by focused innovation initiatives. Our highly profitable Composite Materials market
field is focused on serving the growing demand in the industrial and electronics end markets, while CDMO
activities are shifting towards higher value products and improved capacity utilization. Growth in end
markets (e.g., base chemicals such as ethylene and acetylene and pharmaceutical and vitamin
intermediates) served by our PIC market field, which accounted for 24% of our 2020 sales to third parties,
is largely driven by a clear focus on the most attractive niches, including high-tech industrial applications,
and serving pharma and vitamin end markets and underlying Vitamin B3 consumption growth, particularly
growth in animal feed and supplements penetration. Growth in end markets served by our CDMO market
field, which accounted for 7% of our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be 2% to 3% per year from
2019 to 2025 and is largely driven by increasing outsourcing of agrochemical players as well as serving
customers across various industries in need for complex chemical processes or fermentation. Growth in
end markets (e.g., electronics, industrial and transportation) served by our Composite Materials market
field, which accounted for 4% of our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be 6.8% per year from 2019
to 2025 and is largely driven by growth of high performance composite materials in electronics and
industrial applications.

**_Business transformation and operational excellence_**

Our business plan includes organic initiatives based on sales and innovation projects to drive topline
growth. The portfolio shift towards high-margin Microbial Control Solutions end markets and
development of attractive Specialty Chemical Services niches is anticipated to drive growth and increase
sales to third parties to above CHF2.1 billion by 2025. We have already seen that our increased focus on
these markets in 2020 has contributed to higher growth, notably in areas with above average profitability
(e.g., Hygiene with fully fledge solutions compared to raw material sales). This has already contributed not
only to top line growth but also to substantial margin improvement for our Microbial Control Solutions
business unit in 2020. We believe our organic initiatives will secure our business plan as a standalone
company for the next five years. Additionally, under new ownership we expect to be able to tap into further
growth ideas and M&A beyond the current business plan.

The second part of our business transformation is operational excellence. Existing cost savings initiatives in
operations will continue to gain momentum over the medium term. ‘‘Pivot’’ is an established program
aimed at cost of goods sold improvements, including fixed cost reduction, alternative chemical routes,
debottlenecking and variable cost reduction. Pivot initially started in Visp and has since been rolled out to
other sites and has, for example, enabled our Mapleton facility to implement its Covid-19 related ramp up
in record time. ‘‘Blackbird’’ is a focused program for operational excellence at our four main Microbial
Control Solutions sites in the US with tailored projects for each facility and is already delivering benefits at
our site in Rochester. We began implementing a global supply chain integration and network optimization
in 2019, with a focus on inventory management and plan to increase customer focus supply chain
initiatives. We will also continue to improve our Visp manufacturing site with a focus on automation,
control room and plant consolidation and digitization measures. Finally, there are numerous initiatives in
operations supporting business growth in our Microbial Control Solutions business unit, with the key
initiatives being improving efficiency gains by streamlining our asset footprint and further increasing our
quat production output. Our operations organization has delivered significant gross profit improvements
and we believe it will continue to do so going forward.

In addition, following the completion of the Acquisition, we intend to implement the Transformation
Program, which is focused on cost savings opportunities related to (i) manufacturing; (ii) raw materials
procurement; (iii) indirect spend control; (iv) sales and marketing costs; (v) G&A costs; and (vi) R&D
costs. We expect to realize cost savings of CHF69 million within 18 months after the Acquisition Closing
Date and an additional CHF2 million from IT cost savings, assuming, among other things, that the
program will be implemented beginning on the Acquisition Closing Date and driven by key management.
We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to approximately CHF103 million between 2021 and 2023 in
connection with these initiatives, comprising: (i) approximately CHF58 million in expected one-off costs,
including severance costs, IT costs and program delivery costs, including consulting, financial and legal
advisory fees in connection with implementing our Transformation Program; and (ii) approximately
CHF45 million in expected capital expenditure related to manufacturing savings.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On February 8, 2021, Swiss Holdco, an entity indirectly owned by Bain Capital and the Cinven Funds,
entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire the LSI Business from the Seller. We currently
expect the Acquisition to complete during the course of the second half of 2021. The consummation of the
Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary
antitrust and regulatory approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. Under the terms of the
Sale and Purchase Agreement, Swiss Holdco has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required
clearances following the signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. If closing has not occurred on the
date falling twelve months after the signing date of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Sale and
Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The estimated sources and uses of funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table
below. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual
Acquisition Closing Date, and the actual purchase price for the Acquisition, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates for amounts not denominated in Swiss francs, the amount of the Equity Contribution (as
defined below) or other sources made available and differences between estimated and actual fees and
expenses. In particular, the purchase price under the Sale and Purchase Agreement as shown below
reflects the agreed purchase price of CHF4,225 million, less estimated purchase price adjustments under

10


-----

the Sale and Purchase Agreement of CHF263 million. These purchase price adjustments are estimated
based on amounts as of September 30, 2020 and include CHF252 million of unfunded liabilities (which
include pensions liabilities, other debt-like items, such as lease liabilities, tax payables and restructuring
and legal provisions, less other cash-like items) and other purchase price deductions, and CHF11 million of
existing debt (including short-term related party debt to Lonza Group and short-term debt to banks) that
are expected to be refinanced at the Acquisition Closing Date. These amounts may change depending on
number of factors, including, among others, the timing of the Acquisition Closing Date. The final purchase
will be calculated based on the relevant purchase price reductions as at the first calendar day of the month
in which the Acquisition Closing Date falls, as provided for in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

contributions from the Sponsors may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses are greater or less than our current
estimate or as a result of purchase price adjustments under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, and is inclusive of funding, if any,
from management.

(5) Represents the estimated purchase price payable to the Seller pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement on the Acquisition
Closing Date of CHF4,225 million, less estimated purchase price adjustments under the Sale and Purchase Agreement of
CHF263 million. These purchase price adjustments are estimated based on amounts as of September 30, 2020 and include
adjustments for: (1) unfunded liabilities in an amount of CHF213 million, consisting of pension liabilities and the net amount of
other debt-like items (comprised of lease liabilities, tax payables and restructuring and legal provisions) and cash-like items;
(2) a purchase price deduction of CHF38 million; and (3) CHF11 million in short-term related party debt to Lonza and
short-term debt to banks (as described below). The actual purchase price may change and will be calculated based on the
relevant purchase price reductions as at the first calendar day of the month in which the Acquisition Closing Date falls. As of
December 31, 2020, current debt owed to Lonza Group was CHF1,519 million. The purchase price will be paid in cash at
closing. The purchase price is comprised of an equity purchase price and the purchase of receivables for amounts owed to
Lonza Group by the LSI Business. See ‘‘—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.’’

(6) Represents other financial debt, including short-term related party debt of CHF6 million to Lonza Group and short-term debt
of CHF5 million to banks, as of September 30, 2020. The actual amount at the Acquisition Closing Date may vary.

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including net interest expense that will accrue on
proceeds of the Notes deposited into escrow, underwriting, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other
transaction costs and professional fees.

All related party financing arrangements between Lonza Group and the LSI Business will be terminated
prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, except for certain related party loan receivables denominated in US
dollars which will be acquired on the Acquisition Closing Date, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the
Sale and Purchase Agreement. In addition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement provides for a set-off
mechanism, pursuant to which, following such termination of related party financing arrangements, certain
net related party receivables or certain related party net payables with Lonza Group may remain
outstanding. Such related party receivables or payables with Lonza Group, if any, will then be off-set
against the purchase price for the Acquisition.

The Sale and Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Seller as to capacity, title
and certain business matters as well as customary signing to closing covenants given by the Seller

11


-----

regarding, among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the LSI Business pending
closing of the Acquisition. The Seller’s liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds
and limitations. In addition, pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Seller has agreed to take
certain actions to facilitate the ability of the LSI Business to operate on a standalone basis, including,
subject to certain exceptions, the provision of a number of services pursuant to the Global Services
Agreement, Site Services Agreements, Supply and Tolling Agreements, including in relation to general
administration and business services, customs support, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources,
compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions), logistics and warehousing and others, to the LSI Business,
following the Acquisition. See ‘‘Business—Material Agreements—Post-Acquisition Arrangements with
_Lonza.’’_

Further, the Seller has agreed that, for three years from the Acquisition Closing Date, neither it nor its
affiliates will engage in the territory in which LSI will directly or indirectly acquire, own, participate or
engage in the development, manufacture, marketing, sale or supply of products currently produced by the
LSI Business (or substantially or substantively similar to any such products) in any geographies where the
LSI Business is active or where the LSI Business had already invested, or had made substantial plans to
move into immediately prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Seller and the LSI Business each respectively agreed that they would not induce or attempt to induce
any supplier of each other’s business to cease to supply, or to restrict or vary the terms of supply, to the
other’s business. Also, the Seller and the LSI Business each agreed that, for two years from the Acquisition
Closing Date, neither party would induce or attempt to induce any employee from the other party’s
respective business to enter into employment with it.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuers and their subsidiaries will not have control over the
boards of directors of the Target Companies. Such boards of directors of the Target Companies and their
management will be required, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, to manage the LSI Business under
their own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interests of the LSI Business. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Issuers do not currently control the LSI Business and will not_
_control the LSI Business until the Acquisition Closing Date.’’_

**_Escrow Accounts_**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from
the offering of the Notes into the Escrow Accounts. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Escrow
Agent. See ‘‘—The Offering—Collateral.’’

The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied
promptly (and in any event within three business days). See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of_
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ If these conditions are not satisfied on or before the Escrow_
Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of
the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to,
but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of_
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the_
_conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to_
_redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without_
_relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.’’_

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the SUN Issuer, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes,
and Luxco 3, in the case of the Senior Notes, will be required to fund the relevant Issuer in such aggregate
amounts as are required in order to enable such Issuer to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow
Account fees, negative interest on the Escrow Account balances and costs and accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption
date (the ‘‘Escrow Equity Commitment’’), pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter. The holders of the
Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on the
Issuers’ rights to enforcement under the Escrow Equity Commitment. See ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—_

_If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required_
_to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without_
_relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.’’_

**Sustainability-Linked Features of the Notes**

As a part of our overarching commitment to sustainability, we are embedding material sustainability
performance indicators during our formation as an independent entity following the Acquisition. By
defining our sustainable performance targets (initially based on the targets set by Lonza Group as applied
to the LSI Business), we are sharing our commitment to reducing environmental impact with the
stakeholders, as well as taking the necessary steps to maintain a competitive advantage in the markets
where we operate.

As part of our commitment to sustainability initiatives, our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework
(the ‘‘Framework’’) has been developed to provide a single robust methodology for sustainability-linked
financing instruments. The Framework is developed in alignment with the International Capital Market
Association’s Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles (‘‘SLBP’’), as well as the Sustainability-Linked Loan
Principles (‘‘SLLP’’) administered by the Loan Market Association. We have selected key performance
indicators (‘‘KPIs’’) and calibrated our sustainable performance targets in this context.

Our sustainability improvement initiatives focus on reducing greenhouse gas (‘‘GHG’’) emissions and waste
intensity. The reference base has been set at 2018.

GHG emissions intensity (which includes emissions from sources owned or controlled by LSI and
emissions from the generation of electricity and steam purchased by LSI) is measured in tons of CO2
equivalent based on total sales (tons CO2 equivalent / CHF millions). In 2018, the LSI Business’ GHG
emissions intensity was 484.0 tons CO2 equivalent / CHF millions. We aim to reduce GHG emissions
intensity by 36% by 2030, compared to that 2018 baseline. An interim target to reduce GHG emissions
intensity by at least 18% by 2024 has been set using our annualised 3% reduction target. Such KPI and
sustainable performance target contribute to the EU environmental objective ‘‘Climate Change
Mitigation’’, as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13.

Waste intensity is measured in waste generated in tons based on total sales (tons / CHF millions). In 2018,
the LSI Business’ waste intensity was 49.5 tons / CHF millions. We aim to reduce waste intensity by 24% by
2030, compared to that 2018 baseline. An interim target to reduce waste intensity by at least 12% by 2024
has been set using our annualised 2% reduction target. Such KPI and sustainable performance target
contribute to the EU environmental objective ‘‘Transition to a Circular Economy’’, as well as the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12.

The Indentures will require us to report no later than March 31, 2025 to the Trustee our GHG emissions
intensity and waste intensity for 2024 in accordance with the above sustainable performance targets. From
and including, 2025, the interest rate on the Notes shall be increased by up to 0.25%, unless the
Group has achieved such sustainable performance targets (which shall be confirmed by an Assurance
Letter (as defined under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Interest’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Notes—Interest’’) from a qualified provider of third-party assurance or attestation services (i.e., an auditing_
firm)). See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Interest’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—
_Interest.’’ The verification of the Group’s actual sustainable performance for 2024 relative to such_
sustainable performance targets will be made publicly available. Notwithstanding anything in this offering
memorandum to the contrary, neither our sustainability report delivered to the Trustee as described above,
nor the Framework is or will be incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

**Recent Developments**

_The preliminary financial data included in this section has been prepared by, and is the sole responsibility of,_
_LSI management. No third party has audited, reviewed, compiled, or applied agreed-upon procedures with_
_respect to such preliminary financial data. Such data has been derived from preliminary management accounts,_
_is preliminary and is subject to financial closing procedures which have not yet been completed. In particular,_
_our Financial Statements are not prepared on the same basis, and therefore, while we believe these preliminary_
_results and estimates to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences_
_could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information and this information may_
_not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year or any future period. See ‘‘Forward_
_Looking Statements,’’ ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations’’ in this offering memorandum for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors_
_that could affect our future performance._

We continued to trade in line with our expectations, with growth in sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. We are
performing ahead of our budget as at March 31, 2021, with sales to third parties in each of our Hygiene,
Home and Personal Care, Wood Protection, Paints and Coatings, Crop Protection, PIC, Composite
Materials and CDMO market fields ahead of those for the three months ended March 31, 2020 on a
currency-adjusted basis. Our sales to third parties grew in each of our geographic areas, EIMEA, APAC
and Americas, in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31,
2020, on a currency-adjusted basis. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins increased slightly in the three months
ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, driven by strong demand
across most of our market fields and continuous low operational expenditures.

pledge in respect of intercompany receivables owed to the SUN Issuer by the SSN Issuer (the collateral described in clause (y),
the ‘‘Shared Collateral’’). The Shared Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the liabilities under the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations and may also secure certain future indebtedness. The validity
and enforceability of the Note Guarantees of the Senior Notes and the security and the liability of each Guarantor and security
provider will be subject to certain limitations. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’ The security interests in favor of the Senior Notes and the Note_
Guarantees thereof may be released under certain circumstances.

(4) The SUN Issuer, SSN Issuer, Swiss Holdco, Swiss Midco, US Holdco, US Bidco and UK Bidco were incorporated as holding
companies for the purpose of the Acquisition, have no independent business operations, other than those in connection with
their incorporation and the Transactions, and have no significant assets, other than the equity interest each of these companies
holds in its subsidiaries and, with respect to the Issuers only, as of the Issue Date, the Escrowed Property pending
consummation of the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the restrictive covenants in the Indentures will only
apply to the Issuers and the Issue Date Guarantors. The Issuers and their subsidiaries will not obtain control of the LSI
Business until the Acquisition Closing Date.

(5) In connection with the Transactions, the SSN Issuer and US Holdco, as original borrowers, are expected to enter into the Senior
Facilities Agreement, which will provide for committed facilities in the form of (i) Senior Term Facilities in an aggregate amount
of CHF1,834 million (EUR and USD equivalent) and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of A375 million. On the
Issue Date, all of the Issue Date Guarantors will guarantee the Senior Facilities on a senior basis, subject to customary
guarantee limitations. Within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and customary guarantee limitations, the Senior Facilities are expected to be guaranteed by the Post-Closing
Guarantors on a senior basis.

(6) On the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to use the proceeds from the Senior Term Facilities, the Notes and the Equity
Contribution to (i) fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition; (ii) refinance certain existing debt; and (iii) pay the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

(7) The SSN Issuer is offering US$350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes

and future senior indebtedness, including the Senior Facilities, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to all of the SSN Issuer’s
existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, (iii) be
effectively subordinated to all of the SSN Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness or other liabilities that are secured by liens
that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness
or liabilities and (iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or other liabilities of the subsidiaries of
the SSN Issuer that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors. On the Issue Date
and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each
of Swiss Holdco, Swiss Midco, US Holdco, US Bidco and UK Bidco, subject to customary guarantee limitations. Within
150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in
favor of obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and
customary guarantee limitations, the Senior Secured Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Post-Closing
Guarantors. On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, on a first-ranking basis, by certain share pledges and pledges of assets (including bank accounts and
intercompany receivables) granted by the SUN Issuer, the SSN Issuer, Swiss Holdco, US Holdco, US Bidco and UK Bidco (as
described in detail in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—General’’) (the ‘‘SSNs Issue-Date Collateral’’). In

substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senir Secured Notes and the Note
Guarantees thereof will be secured by (i) a share pledge over Swiss Holdco’s shares in the capital of Lonza Solutions AG; and
(ii) a pledge of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the SSN Issuer (as lender) by Lonza Solutions AG (as
borrower); and (ii) within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles
and substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Note Guarantees thereof will be secured by (A) a fixed charge over Lonza Solutions AG’s shares in the capital of UK Bidco and
a pledge over its shares in the capital of Swiss Midco and Lonza Services AG, (B) with respect to any Post-Closing Guarantors
which become borrowers under the Senior Facilities Agreement, security over the material bank accounts located in the
relevant Post-Closing Guarantors’ jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary exclusions, including in respect of
accounts that form part of a cash pooling arrangement (or similar or equivalent arrangement) or that are used in conjunction
with any factoring, securitization or other receivables financing arrangement), (C) with respect to each Post-Closing Guarantor
incorporated in the U.S. (Lonza, LLC and Arch Personal Care Products, L.P.), security over substantially all of such PostClosing Guarantor’s assets (subject to customary exclusions, including no real estate security) and (D) with respect to each PostClosing Guarantor incorporated in England and Wales (Arch UK Biocides Limited), floating security over substantially all of its
assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary exclusions, including no real estate security) (collectively,
the ‘‘SSN Post—Closing Collateral,’’ and together with the SSNs Issue-Date Collateral, the ‘‘SSN Collateral’’). The SSN
Collateral will also secure, on a first-ranking basis, the Senior Facilities, as well as certain hedging obligations and may also
secure certain future indebtedness. A portion of the SSN Collateral, consisting of the Shared Collateral, will also secure the
Senior Notes on a second-priority basis. The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes
and the security and the liability of each Guarantor and security provider will be subject to certain limitations. See ‘‘Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’ The_

circumstances.

the Acquisition, (ii) refinance certain existing debt and (iii) pay the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See
‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuers or any Guarantor with respect
to the Notes or Note Guarantees will be made without withholding
or deduction for taxes unless required by law. If such withholding

24


-----

or deduction is required by law in any ‘‘relevant taxing
jurisdiction,’’ the relevant Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the
net amounts received after the withholding or deduction is not less
than the amount that would have been received in the absence of
the withholding or deduction, subject to certain exceptions. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Amounts’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Additional Amounts.’’

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** At any time prior to, 2024, the Issuers may redeem some
or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed, _plus, in each case,_
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
applicable redemption date plus the applicable ‘‘make whole’’
premium.

Prior to, 2024, the Issuers may, during each twelve month
period following the Issue Date, redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes (including
any additional Notes of the same series) at a redemption price
equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date.

At any time prior to, 2024, the Issuers may redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes
using the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the
redemption price of % and % of the principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes
redeemed, respectively, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date,
_provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal_
amount of such series of Notes remain outstanding after the
redemption (unless all Notes of such series are redeemed
substantially concurrently).

At any time on or after, 2024, the Issuers may redeem
some or all of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption’’
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption.’’

**Optional Redemption for Taxation**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law (or in its interpretation) of any
relevant taxing jurisdiction impose certain withholding taxes or
other deductions on the payments on any series of Notes, the
relevant Issuer may redeem the applicable series of Notes in whole,
but not in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the redemption date. See ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’_
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons.’’_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a
change of control or upon certain asset sales, each holder of any
series of Notes may require the relevant Issuer, as applicable, to
repurchase all or a portion of the Notes of the relevant series at a
price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date. However, a change of control will not be
deemed to have occurred if, pro forma for such change of control, a
specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in

25


-----

connection with such event. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Change of Control.’’_

**Escrow Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . .** Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, and pending
consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will
deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow
Accounts. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Escrow
Agent. The release of the proceeds deposited in the Escrow
Accounts will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the
Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within three
business days). Upon delivery to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent
of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the release
of the proceeds from escrow are satisfied, the Escrowed Property
will be released to the Issuers and utilized as described in ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of_
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’_
If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property have not
been satisfied on or prior to the business day immediately following
the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other
events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption.

The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal
to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
such special mandatory redemption date.

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the SUN Issuer, in
the case of the Senior Secured Notes, and Luxco 3, in the case of
the Senior Notes, will be required to fund the relevant Issuer in
such aggregate amounts as are required in order to enable the
Issuers to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow Account fees,
negative interest on the Escrow Accounts’ balances and costs and
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, owing
to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption
date (the ‘‘Escrow Equity Commitment’’), pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter. The holders of the Notes will not have any
direct right to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must
rely on the Issuers’ respective rights to enforcement under the
Escrow Equity Commitment.

In addition, the conditions applicable to the special mandatory
redemption may be waived by holders of the Notes representing a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding.

See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ and ‘‘Risk_
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the conditions_
_precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the_
_Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts_
_may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying_
_on the Escrow Equity Commitment.’’_

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indentures will limit, among other things, the ability of the
Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries to:

26


-----

              - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

              - create or incur certain liens;

              - make certain restricted payments;

              - make certain investments;

              - impose restrictions on the ability of their subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to the relevant Issuer;

              - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

              - transfer, receive or sell certain assets including subsidiary
stock;

              - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

              - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to certain exceptions and
qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants.’’_

Certain of these covenants may also be suspended in the event that
the Notes receive investment grade ratings from the relevant credit
rating agencies. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Termination of Covenants on Achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Certain Covenants—Termination of Covenants on Achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status.’’_

**U.S. Federal Income Tax**
**Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . .** For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations
of an investment in the Notes, see ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—
_Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’ You_
should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal,
state, local and other tax consequences of an investment in the
Notes.

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof have not been
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and will not be so registered. The Notes are
subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See ‘‘Transfer
_Restrictions.’’ Holders of the Notes will not have the benefit of any_
exchange or registration rights.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should
consider carefully all the information in this offering memorandum
and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set
forth in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section before making a decision
whether to invest in the Notes.

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
market. Although the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised
us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue market making at any
time without notice. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that an
active trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the

27


-----

Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted
or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a
regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive
2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended.

**ERISA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** See ‘‘Certain ERISA Considerations.’’

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indentures, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be
governed by the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance
of doubt, articles 470-1 to 470-19 of the Luxembourg law of
August 10, 1915 relating to commercial companies as amended will
not apply in respect of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by English law.
Each Security Document will be governed by applicable local laws.

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_The following tables present our summary financial and other information and have been derived from, and_
_should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS_
_and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial_
_and Other Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations,’’ ‘‘Selected Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

_We have extracted the combined and carve-out historical financial information of the LSI Business for the years_
_ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 from the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum. As the LSI Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating_
_activities within the LSI Business were under the common control of Lonza Group, in each case, prior to the_
_finalization of the Carve-out, the historical financial information of the LSI Business presented in this offering_
_memorandum as at and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 has been prepared on a_
_combined and carve-out basis. In the year ended December 31, 2020, Lonza Group reallocated certain assets_
_and liabilities between its continuing business and the LSI Business, resulting in certain changes to the asset and_
_liability allocations to the LSI Business in the carve-out approach applied in the preparation of the 2019_
_Financial Statements. These revised allocations were presented to enhance comparability and were reflected in_
_the 2020 Financial Statements, including in the comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31,_
_2019. See Note 1.2 to the 2020 Financial Statements. Accordingly, figures as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019 included in the 2020 Financial Statements may differ from those included in the 2019_
_Financial Statements. Figures in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019_
_have been extracted or derived from the comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019_
_included in the 2020 Financial Statements. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Historical_
_Financial Information’’ and ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Basis of Preparation’’ and our_
_Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited pro forma financial information of the SUN Issuer_
_as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020, including pro forma indebtedness, pro forma senior secured_
_indebtedness and pro forma interest expense, which has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the Transactions_
_as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on December 31, 2020, for the purposes of calculating pro forma_
_indebtedness and pro forma senior secured indebtedness and (ii) on January 1, 2020, for the purposes of_
_calculating pro forma interest expense. The pro forma financial information as at and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our_
_indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2020 or_
_January 1, 2020, respectively; nor does it purport to project our financial results, indebtedness or interest expense_
_at any future date. The pro forma financial information as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has not_
_been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards or in accordance_
_with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or any other_
_regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other regulator. Neither the assumptions_
_underlying the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information as at and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2020 have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing_
_standards. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited Pro Forma Financial_
_Information.’’_

_Results of operations for prior years are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future_
_period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that certain performance indicators and ratios that we present_
_in this offering memorandum are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS, U.S. GAAP,_
_SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Such Non-IFRS Measures may not_
_accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt and should not be considered as_
_alternatives to performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, SEC_
_requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles, may not be comparable to other similarly_
_titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in_
_isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Because of these_
_limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us_
_to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations._
_You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and using these_
_Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.’’_

driven by unbilled payables.

Notes:

(1) _Pro forma indebtedness represents the consolidated_ _pro forma financial debt of the SUN Issuer, after giving effect to the_
Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2020, as set forth under ‘‘Capitalization.’’ Pro forma indebtedness excludes
our lease liabilities (amounting to CHF14 million as at December 31, 2020). We do not expect to make any drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’

(2) _Pro forma senior secured indebtedness represents the consolidated_ _pro forma financial debt of the SUN Issuer, after giving_
effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2020, secured on the SSN Collateral on a first-ranking basis
(excluding indebtedness represented by the Notes and the Note Guarantees).

(3) We define pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as Normalized Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted for the ‘‘run rate’’ pro forma effect of
certain customer contracts entered into during the first quarter of 2021 or expected to be entered into during April 2021, and as
further adjusted for certain planned cost savings in connection with the Transformation Program. We define Normalized
Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted for standalone adjustments to reflect the estimated cost savings of LSI
operating as a standalone business from Lonza Group and certain other adjustments which we believe to be of a
non-operational or non-recurring or exceptional nature or to reflect normalizations across periods. We define Adjusted
EBITDA as profit for the period, as adjusted by adding back income taxes, share of loss/(profit) of associates and financial
expenses less financial income, and by adding back depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible
assets and amortization expenses and impairment charges and reversal of impairment on property, plant and equipment and
intangibles. We define Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of Carveout Adjustments as Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting the reversal
of carveout adjustments originally made to allocate certain costs, primarily corporate overhead function costs, of the Lonza
Group to the LSI Business. These adjustments, which are further explained in Note 1.3 Basis of Preparation to the 2020
Financial Statements, were necessary to reflect the fact that the LSI Business has been carved out from the larger Lonza Group.
The allocated costs may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had the LSI Business been
operating as a separate entity apart from Lonza Group. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS
_Financial Measures’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors_
_Affecting Our Future Results of Operations—Transformation Program.’’ Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of_
Carveout Adjustments, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA are collectively referred to herein as
our ‘‘EBITDA-based measures.’’

We believe that our EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and our ability to
incur and service our indebtedness. Our EBITDA-based measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under
IFRS, U.S. GAAP, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as
alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS. Our EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable
to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in
isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and the
other EBITDA-based measures presented herein differ from Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Indenture. Because of
these limitations, our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to
invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our indebtedness. You should
compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum and using these non-IFRS measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance. See ‘‘Presentation of
_Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.’’_

(c) Reflects the reversal of carveout adjustments originally made to allocate certain costs, primarily corporate overhead
function costs as well as royalty payments for the Lonza brand and Lonza Group environmental and other charges
allocated to LSI. These adjustments, which are further explained in Note 1.3 Basis of Preparation to the 2020 Financial
Statements, were necessary to reflect the fact that the LSI Business has been carved out from the larger Lonza Group. The
allocated costs may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had the LSI Business been
operating as a separate entity apart from Lonza Group.

Notes:

(a) Standalone adjustments reflect the estimated adjustments to LSI’s cost base as a standalone business apart from Lonza
Group. These include: (i) estimated amounts of CHF46 million, CHF29 million and CHF24 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, which primarily relate to corporate overhead function costs as well as
royalty payments for the Lonza brand and Lonza Group environmental and other charges allocated to LSI as part of Lonza
Group, which we do not expect to incur as a standalone business following the Acquisition; (ii) adjustments of CHF(11)
million, CHF(11) million and CHF(15) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, to
reflect the standalone operating costs we expect to incur under our target operating model, the standalone cost base model
for the LSI Business developed in connection with the Carve-out (but before giving effect to the Transformation Program,
which is described further below), and the elimination of certain operating expenses allocated to LSI by Lonza Group that

34


-----

we do not expect to incur under the target operating model; and (iii) adjustments of CHF1 million, CHF5 million and
CHF4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, related to the estimated positive
financial impact of supply and tolling agreements with companies within Lonza Group on an arm’s length basis. See
‘‘Business—Material Agreements—Post-Acquisition Agreements with Lonza—Supply and Tolling Agreements.’’

(b) Reflects the reversal of the non-cash charges relating to LSI executives’ long-term incentive plan (‘‘LTIP’’), which we
expect to replace with a new equity-based management incentive plan.

(c) Represents the add-back of non-operational or non-core or exceptional legal, consulting and restructuring costs incurred in
the periods under review. These include: (i) restructuring costs related to the reorganization of LSI into the business units
Microbial Control Solutions and Specialty Chemical Services, including severance payments in regards to the elimination
of redundant roles in legacy LSI business units, as well as dismantling costs in connection with certain properties in
Switzerland and in the UK; (ii) legal expenses and settlements, including a litigation settlement received from the previous
owner of the Arch Chemicals business, which is now part of LSI; and legal costs in relation to a 2018 antitrust investigation
and (iii) external consulting costs relating to non-recurring strategic projects.

(d) Represents the elimination of Adjusted EBITDA from exited business (not accounted for as discontinued operations) and
discontinued products and products affected by regulatory changes. These include: (i) the Agro business, which we
disposed of in 2018; (ii) the Cyanuric Chloride business, which we exited in 2019; (iii) the 2018 impact of certain Personal
Care Ingredients product lines that were discontinued in 2017; (iv) the costs of certain inventory scrapping at our
Rochester site related to the discontinuation of the Personal Care Ingredients business; (v) the decrease in sales of Zinc
Omadine� ZOE�, which was negatively impacted by regulatory changes in Canada in 2018; and (vi) the elimination of the
sales decline in the Molluscicides product group, which was negatively impacted by EU regulations in 2018 that banned the
sale or use of certain materials used in molluscicides.

(e) Represents the elimination of the impact of significant supply disruptions and specific quality and manufacturing issues
that are not expected to recur, as well as phasing the impact of regular scheduled maintenance at our Visp site. These
include: (i) one-off profits from temporarily increased sales prices due to temporary supply constraints for the key raw
material used in BIT manufacturing due to a factory explosion in Yancheng, China, in March 2019; (ii) costs related to a
recall of Meta Slug Pellet products in 2019; (iii) a charge related to the costs of reproducing certain CDMO products for a
customer; (iv) the 2018 effect of price reductions in 2017 for a product shipment that was initially not accepted by the
customer; (v) the normalization of 2018 sales to prior periods for sales related to past campaigns; and (vi) the phasing
across periods of the estimated impact of the regular maintenance shutdown of our Visp site, which occurs every two and a
half years and last occurred in April and May 2020, with the effect of the shutdown on Adjusted EBITDA distributed
equally across periods.

(f) Represents the normalization of inventory provision expenses to be more representative of long-term trends, which is
comprised of the normalization of inventory scrapping and valuation charges across the periods presented to reflect an
estimated normal level of inventory scrapping and valuation charges of CHF10 million. 2020 inventory scrapping and
valuation charges were higher than in previous years due to inventory scrapping in connection with the carve out of the LSI
Business from Lonza Group.

(g) Represents the reversal of an incremental charge related to LSI’s short-term incentive plan (‘‘STIP’’) in 2020 in order to
reflect the budgeted STIP amount for that year. STIP payments in 2019 and 2018 were made on different criteria, and
therefore no adjustment has been made for those periods.

(h) Represents the elimination of the impact or reallocation over the relevant periods of other exceptional or non-recurring
miscellaneous items. These include: (i) the elimination of Brazilian VAT costs in 2018 relating to intercompany services
provided between 2005 and 2012; (ii) the elimination of 2020 expenditures directly related to the Covid-19 pandemic;
(iii) the elimination of the gain on the sale of our South Plainfield asset in 2020; (iv) the reversal of a provision for an
insurance deductible booked in relation to our plant in Lake Charles, which was impacted by Hurricane Laura in August
2020, as we paid remediation costs and did not make an insurance claim for the remediation costs; (v) the removal of
certain government support measures in China and in Auckland and New Plymouth, New Zealand, in relation to Covid-19;
(vi) normalization of the accruals for STIP payments; (vii) the elimination of certain income from the sale of recycled
palladium at our Visp site; (viii) the reallocation to a prior period of a provision relating to cash settlement payments to
customers in 2017 related to our exit of the Personal Care Ingredients business; (ix) normalization to the relevant periods
relating to a timing mismatch between 2018 revenues and 2019 expenses recognized in connection with technical services in
the Wood Protection market field; (x) normalization of volume rebates across periods; (xi) reversal of the positive impact
of the release of a provision in 2020; (xii) the release of unused environmental provisions due to an updated estimate of
future environmental remediation costs; (xiii) normalization of income from sale of shares and costs from invoices;
(xiv) the release of an environmental provision relating to prior contamination and (x) the phasing over the relevant
periods of a 2020 invoice from a payroll provider for services provided between 2018 and 2020.

(i) Reflects the estimated pro forma run-rate effect of a customer contract entered in the first quarter of 2021 and another
customer contract that we expect to enter into in April 2021 that are due to contribute incremental sales from 2022 and
2021, respectively.

(j) In connection with the Acquisition, the Sponsors commissioned a third-party due diligence report from a global consulting
firm to analyze the financial condition and operations of the LSI Business and its potential for achieving cost savings. This
report has identified up to CHF99 million in potential ‘‘run rate’’ cost savings, based on the cost base pursuant to LSI’s
target operating model, that may be achievable through the implementation of various transformation measures over a
period of five years (not including potential revenue upside from certain pricing initiatives identified in the report). This
cost savings potential is also supported by other due diligence and detailed cost assessments undertaken by the Sponsors in
connection with the Acquisition as well as by benchmarking LSI’s profitability against that of its public peer companies. It

35


-----

is also comparable to profitability improvements achieved in other corporate carve-outs in the chemicals sector under
sponsor ownership. In addition, we expect to achieve cost savings of CHF2 million from the outset in relation to IT costs
included in the target operating model, largely related to the non-hiring of initially planned employees. We intend to
initiate a Transformation Program to implement these transformation measures upon completion of the Acquisition and
expect to realize cost savings of CHF69 million within 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date, although we believe
that some of these measures can be initiated even prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, because they are a continuation of
LSI’s existing and ongoing efficiency measures or involve not filling positions that were initially contemplated by the target
operating model for the LSI standalone business, or filling these positions in lower cost locations than initially planned. We
give effect to the cost savings that we believe, based on due diligence conducted in connection with the Acquisition,
including the third-party due diligence report, are achievable within 18 months, as well as the expected CHF2 million in IT
cost savings from the outset, in calculating pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as if the underlying cost savings had been realized
on December 31, 2020. We expect to incur one-off costs of approximately CHF58 million and capital expenditures of
approximately CHF45 million between 2021 and 2023 in connection with these initiatives. The cost savings potential and
adjustments set forth in the following table are based on various assumptions and estimates by external consultants and
management regarding the future impact of our cost saving initiatives. This information is inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
those assumed in the adjustments below. As a result, while we believe that these adjustments and potential cost savings are
reasonable estimates, the actual results and cost savings in any given period may differ from those estimated herein,
including because a substantial portion of the savings we expect to achieve are from procurement initiatives which depend
on negotiations with third-party suppliers that are outside our control. We may not be able to realize these cost savings,
either in the amount or within the timeframe we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these cost savings may be
higher than expected. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Industry—We may fail to achieve the targeted
_benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures.’’_

Notes:

(i) Reflects the ‘‘run rate’’ cost savings potential from transformation measures over an implementation period of five years
identified in the due diligence report described above.

(ii) Reflects ‘‘run rate’’ cost savings we expect to realize within 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date from the
implementation of the Transformation Program, which includes the reorientation of our business, optimization of our
organizational structure, operational improvements and a focus on increasing organizational efficiency. We give effect to
these cost savings in calculating pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as if they had been realized on December 31, 2020.

(iii) Represents expected cost savings related to our manufacturing cost savings initiatives and the streamlining of our
manufacturing operations, including implementing personnel optimization and organizational efficiency initiatives. These
include further automation and digitalization at our manufacturing sites, setting more ambitious productivity targets and
increasing productivity through higher utilization and workforce rationalization. We also intend to implement efficiency
measures, such as increases in the proportion of direct workforce, such as operators, at our manufacturing sites compared
to our indirect workforce, such as supervisors, engineers and maintenance workers.

(iv) Represents expected cost savings related to our raw materials procurement operations, with expected annual run-rate cost
savings achievable within five years representing approximately 2% of our 2019 raw material cost base. These include
expected cost savings from procurement of general chemical raw materials. In terms of basic chemicals (such as caustic
soda and ammonia), cost savings are expected to be generated by rebalancing direct and distribution purchases to
optimize pricing and terms and conditions, including more favorable pricing for regionally sourced commodities. For
specialty chemicals (such as amines and glycerin), which are sourced from a small number of large suppliers, the focus is
expected to be on establishing long-term agreements, price indexing, bundling with non-oligopoly products and volume
incentives. For critical sole-sourced raw materials (such as pyridine), we expect to work proactively with suppliers to
establish flexible strategies. We also expect to generate cost savings by optimizing procurement of certain specialty
products and external production spend on finished goods for resale and tollers.

(v) Represents expected cost savings related to logistics, repair and maintenance as well as travel and telecommunication
services expenses. We expect to focus on centralizing management of these costs, which are currently addressed at local
level.

36


-----

(vi) Includes expected cost savings from personnel—related initiatives. We expect to reduce existing complexity of the sales
and marketing function, such as substantial role duplication, as well as to implement non-personnel related initiatives,
such as cost supervision.

(vii) Represents expected cost savings related to initiatives targeting our general and administrative costs, primarily
implementing a leaner operating model that is more consistent with what we understand to be the operating model of our
peers. These initiatives include organizational simplification such as reduction in middle management and administrative
roles, headcount optimizations including attrition savings and non-hiring of new employees initially contemplated by our
target operating model, as well as organizational efficiency through increased automation and retaining higherperforming employees. We also intend to reduce the number of shared service centers we operate from ten to three (with
one in each of EIMEA, APAC and Americas), as well as to shift employees to lower cost countries.

(viii) Represents expected cost savings related to initiatives streamlining our research and development operations.

(ix) Represents expected savings related to IT costs initially included in LSI’s target operating model, largely related to not
making planned employee hires.

(4) _Pro forma interest expense represents the estimated consolidated interest expense of the SUN Issuer on a pro forma basis for_
the year ended December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2020, subject to
the assumptions set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ _Pro forma interest expense includes commitment fees payable on the_
Revolving Credit Facility, but excludes any interest expense in respect of amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving
Credit Facility to fund cash to the LSI Business as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See ‘‘Capitalization.’’ _Pro forma interest_
expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have
actually been had the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2020; nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any
future period or our financial position at any future date.

**Summary Business Unit Information—Adjusted EBITDA After Reversal of Carveout Adjustments**

The table below sets out the Adjusted EBITDA of our two business units after reversal of carveout
adjustments, in each case for the years indicated. The figures presented reflect the reversal of carveout
adjustments originally made to allocate certain costs, primarily corporate overhead function costs of the
Lonza Group to the LSI Business. These adjustments, which are further explained in Note 1.3 _Basis of_
_Preparation to the 2020 Financial Statements, were necessary to reflect the fact that the LSI Business has_
been carved out from the larger Lonza Group. The allocated costs may not be indicative of the actual
expenses that would have been incurred had the LSI Business been operating as a separate entity apart
from Lonza Group.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who (either alone or_
_in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of_
_such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom._
_Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in light of the risks_
_described below and other information in this Offering Memorandum and their personal circumstances. The_
_occurrence of any of the following events could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our_
_business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition and impair our ability to fulfil our obligations in_
_respect of the Notes, potentially causing a loss of all or part of the investment made when purchasing the Notes._

_The risk factors described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all relevant risks and should be used_
_as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we currently_
_deem immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_prospects, results of operations or financial condition._

_This offering memorandum contains ‘‘forward-looking’’ statements that are based on assumptions and_
_estimates, and subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results_
_discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed_
_below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See ‘‘Forward Looking Statements.’’_

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_Adverse and uncertain global economic conditions, including factors affecting our, our customers’ and our_**
**_suppliers’ access to credit, could negatively impact our business and ability to borrow or raise capital._**

Our business may be impacted by fluctuations in consumer demand in the end-markets where our
customers operate, the global economic environment, changes in interest rates and instability in securities
markets around the world, among other factors. Adverse economic conditions can affect consumer and
business spending generally. In particular, a worsening economic climate can result in a decreased demand
in the markets in which our products are used.

The supply-demand balance in the markets where we compete and prices for raw materials are strongly
influenced by the overall economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, China and India. Despite an
improvement in global economic conditions in the second half of 2020, the global economy experienced
one of its sharpest downturns in history. The pace and extent of the global economic recovery remains
uncertain, and certain markets, including emerging markets, may not in the future achieve the growth rates
that they have historically observed. An extended recession or other periods of declining economic
conditions, either globally or in any of the markets in which we operate, could substantially decrease the
demand for our products and adversely affect our business.

Similarly, a significant adverse change in a customer’s financial position, as a result of adverse economic
conditions, Covid-19 or otherwise, could increase our credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or
limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. Continued weakness in the global
economy for a significant period of time, or a further deterioration of global economic conditions, could
result in our customers experiencing less profitability in their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty
in obtaining financing, which may ultimately lead to liquidations or bankruptcies. Any of these occurrences
could cause us to limit or discontinue business with those customers. Our suppliers may also experience
similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfil their obligations. Any of these events could
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

Furthermore, a number of our customers and suppliers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their
operations, which may be limited due to adverse economic conditions. The inability of our customers to
access credit facilities may adversely affect our business by reducing sales and increasing exposure to bad
debt, thereby reducing profitability. In addition, the inability of our suppliers to access credit facilities may
adversely affect our business by increasing prices for raw material and transportation, which could have an
adverse effect on our margins.

Finally, adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets (including as a result of the effects of
Covid-19) could prevent us from obtaining financing or credit at favorable terms in order to fulfil our
financing needs (including the need to refinance or repay debt obligations, including the Notes). If we are
unable to refinance or repay our debt obligations or access the credit and capital markets, we may not be

39


-----

able to pursue certain aspects of our business plans, which could materially adversely affect our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_The chemicals industry, as well as the markets of certain of our customers, is characterized by significant levels of_**
**_competition, which may adversely affect our competitive position, sales and overall operations._**

We are exposed to the competitive characteristics of several different geographic markets and industries,
and our competitors are among some of the world’s largest chemical companies. Our principal competitors
vary across our product lines and range from large global chemical companies to smaller regional
companies. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, research and technology and
marketing resources, may be able to manufacture products more economically and may be able to better
withstand changes in market conditions.

In addition, if the markets for our products expand, we expect that there may be an increase in new
competitors and that existing competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we operate,
further enhancing existing competition. The resulting pressure of increased competition on our margins
could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

Furthermore, a number of our customers are participants in markets that are undergoing consolidation.
For example, Universal Forest Products in North America, which is supplied by a competitor, recently
acquired two of our Wood Protection customers to which we had total sales of CHF16 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020. We could lose individual customers to competitors if they are acquired by, or
consolidate with, other companies that have relationships with our competitors. In addition, ongoing
consolidation in various industries continues to create individual customers with greater purchasing power
and competitors with greater financial and other resources. Customers in established markets face their
own competitive pressures, particularly from businesses in regions with lower overhead costs. Such
competitive pressures may force us to reduce prices and attempt to offset such price reductions with
improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, which may not be possible. Additionally, some
competitors may be better positioned to weather prolonged periods of reduced prices, which may
incentivize them to reduce prices even when not dictated by market and competitive conditions.

**_We may be unable to implement our business strategies._**

Our future financial performance and success largely depend on the ability to implement our business
strategies successfully.

Our business strategies are based on assumptions about future demand for our products, the new products
and applications we are developing and on our continuing ability to produce products profitably. Each of
these factors depends on, among other things, differentiating our offerings and avoiding the
commoditization of key chemistries in our products, our ability to innovate to keep up with changes in
technology, customer preferences or the competitive environment, operate in accordance with regulations
imposed by local jurisdictions to deal with extreme circumstances, obtain necessary regulatory approvals of
appropriate scope, acquire suitable targets, integrate acquired businesses, finance operations and product
development activities, maintain and expand high-quality and efficient manufacturing operations,
efficiently manage our supply chains, respond to competitive and regulatory changes, comply with
competition regulations in various jurisdictions, access quality raw materials in a cost-effective and timely
manner, obtain or secure adequate intellectual property rights, and retain and attract highly skilled
technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel. These challenges may be accentuated as a result
of widespread remote working arrangements due to measures adopted in response to the Covid-19
pandemic. Additionally, even if we achieve our goals, the cost of implementing these initiatives could
ultimately exceed their benefits.

Since the economic downturn in global markets in 2008, 2009 and, more recently, 2020, macroeconomic
volatility has made it more difficult to predict GDP development in many economies, resulting in frequent
modifications to GDP growth expectations published by economic research institutions, as well as in
adjustments by market research specialists, sometimes giving rise to significant revisions to growth
expectations for specific markets. Furthermore, the ongoing uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic may
have a continued adverse effect on economic and geopolitical developments. As a result, many companies
in the chemical and biotech industries, including ourselves, may find it difficult to accurately model and
predict the prospects for their businesses, and it may be difficult for investors to use historical financial
information as an indicator for future results. Any failure by us to accurately predict the economic
environment and the development of our business could lead to misjudgments as to the level of production

capacities needed for our business, increase the risk of failed investments and may materially affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may fail to achieve the targeted benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures._**

Efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial for us to maintain our competitiveness and improve
our profitability, and our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to implement operational
improvement measures. Such operational improvement measures could seek to increase efficiency in
manufacturing through restructuring and rightsizing of production, reduce raw material cost by optimizing
supply chains and procurement functions, and streamline research and development processes. They could
also seek to reduce our administration and general overhead expenses by streamlining management,
centralizing administrative costs and improving IT systems. In developing our financial targets relating to
sales growth and profitability, we have made certain assumptions about the financial impact that these
operational improvement measures will have on our future financial results. However, there can be no
assurance that these initiatives will yield the targeted benefits, or that they will not entail higher
implementation costs than expected or take longer to implement than expected.

In addition, certain adjustments made to calculate pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, annualizing the impact of
certain cost saving measures and adding back expected synergies from certain operational improvement
initiatives presented in this offering memorandum, should be treated with caution when making an
investment decision. These adjustments are based, in part, on a report from a global consulting firm
commissioned by the Sponsors in connection with the Acquisition. In preparing the report, the consulting
firm relied on information and data provided by our management, available data of comparable businesses
and its own analyses and made various assumption regarding our existing operations and our ability to
implement contemplated cost savings and optimization measures and their impact on our operations and
cost base. Accordingly, the adjustments made to calculate pro forma Adjusted EBITDA that we present in
this offering memorandum are based on current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties,
assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
_pro forma financial information. Our anticipated cost savings and operational run-rate synergies are based_
upon assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion and within
certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve planned cost saving and operational run-rate synergies is
dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our control, including
the development of the markets for our products and services, including assumptions about continued
market growth that may not materialize, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions, regulatory
developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these
measures proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned
and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from
our cost saving and operational measures. In addition, cost saving and operational efficiencies from
improved production processes may not be able to be sustained due to changes in customer needs, changes
in regulations, availability and cost of materials or other cost variables. Further, our ability to achieve our
expected cost savings is partly dependent on the successful execution of the separation of the LSI Business
from the Lonza Group, including any incremental costs related thereto.

Our new business initiatives could also result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of key
customers, suppliers and employees and strikes and other industrial actions by our employees, which could
undermine the benefits of the operational improvements by disrupting production and leading to different
costs. Operational efficiency measures generally require a significant amount of management attention and
resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ongoing business operations.
These factors may offset the cost savings we anticipate and which we have included in our _pro forma_
Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, our inability to realize our anticipated cost savings could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_We are exposed to volatility in the availability and price of the raw materials on which our business relies, which may_**
**_adversely impact our results of operations, and we may lose the ability to pass along fluctuations in raw materials_**
**_prices._**

Our margins are significantly impacted by the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge
for our products and the costs of the raw materials required to make these products.

41


-----

The prices for certain of our raw materials, including liquefied petroleum gas (‘‘LPG’’) and light virgin
naphtha (‘‘LVN’’), copper, beta picoline and durene, have historically been volatile. The availability and
price of these raw materials are influenced by factors over which we have limited control, such as market
conditions, general global economic prospects, production capacity, the financial stability of our suppliers,
suppliers’ commitments to others and production constraints, fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and
other commodity prices, infrastructure failures, political conditions, including conflicts, military action,
terrorist attacks and general instability, particularly in energy-producing nations, weather conditions,
regulations and other factors. We utilize financial hedges, forward buy mechanisms, alternative chemistries
and multiple sources of suppliers to mitigate cost fluctuations for certain of our raw materials.

The prices of some of our raw materials, such as LPG and durene, are partially dependent on crude oil
prices. Over the long term, the price of these raw materials reflects the general trends in crude oil prices,
which have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. The price of Brent crude oil has
experienced significant volatility in 2020, with the price of Brent crude oil declining from US$52.73 per
barrel on March 2, 2020 to a low of US$17.32 per barrel on April 21, 2020. The average price of Brent
crude oil was US$32.98 in March 2020, US$23.34 in April 2020 and US$31.02 in May 2020. While the price
of Brent crude oil has since stabilized and recovered, there is no assurance that volatility will not return.
Although we generally seek to pass on raw material price increases and decreases to customers, we may
not be able to pass them on fully or at all, or we may only be able to pass them on with a significant time
delay. Some of our customer agreements include pricing terms which restrict our ability to adjust pricing if
certain purchase volumes are achieved. This limits our ability to pass increases in raw material prices on to
certain of our customers. Depending on the market field and customer, our customer agreements may
include price adjustment provisions which allow us to adjust prices based on certain factors, including
without limitation raw material prices and energy costs. While this permits us to pass on price increase to
our customers, subject to lag time, it also means that declines in raw material prices may have a direct
negative impact on our sales to third parties.

The relative scarcity of certain raw materials can impact our results. Although we generally have multiple
global raw material suppliers, certain raw materials, including but not limited to chromic acid at our
Conley site, hydrazine at our Lake Charles site, TDA at our Visp site and methyl chloride at our Mapleton
site, are available only from a small number of suppliers and in limited circumstances only from a single
source. While we use a limited number of raw materials that are available only from a single source and
order those materials in limited quantities, the loss of any of these raw materials could significantly impact
our ability to deliver differentiated products in some of our most specialized businesses. Accordingly, sole
source and limited source suppliers generally have greater pricing and supply leverage.

In other cases, we may choose to sole source certain raw materials to obtain certain commercial
advantages, including superior pricing and terms. Any disruption in raw material availability from one of
these suppliers may require us to secure raw material supplies from alternative suppliers on less favorable
terms.

Volatility in raw material prices could place strains on our working capital requirements. While we seek to
pass through fluctuations in raw material prices to our customers, there have been delays historically in our
ability to do so. Additionally, interruptions in supply could place increased pressure on our margins and
reduce our net cash flow. Either of these possibilities could materially adversely affect our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition, as well as impair our ability to fulfil our financing
needs (including the need to repay our obligations) or make further investments in our business.

Adverse global economic issues, market instability, including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and
volatile commodity price fluctuations make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers
to accurately forecast future product demand and sales prices, which could cause us to procure raw
materials in excess of end-product demand. This could cause a material increase in our inventory carrying
costs and, in the event of falling market prices for our end products, result in significant charges to
write-down inventory to market prices.

Although we use commodity derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of certain raw materials, such
as LPG, we also rely on our ability to pass through volatility through pricing. Since the value of our
products is to a major extent determined by the raw materials that are required for the manufacturing of
these products, our profitability depends on the relationship between the sales prices for our products and
the costs we incur for raw materials. As prices for most of the raw materials we require tend to be volatile,
we constantly need to adjust sales prices, in particular in an environment of rising raw material prices, in
order to maintain sufficient profitability. In a declining price environment, demand can decline as

42


-----

customers postpone orders in anticipation of further price decreases. In response to changes in demand
levels, our competitors may price their products more aggressively in order to retain market share, which
can result in an adverse market environment for us in the short term until the market reaches a new
equilibrium. There may be other unforeseen effects, which we cannot predict given the volatility of raw
material prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We could be affected by the possibility of disruption in our supplier relationships, which could affect our ability to_**
**_source raw materials._**

We purchase each of our raw materials and active ingredients from a relatively limited number of sources.
As a result, any disruption or delay in the supply of those materials from a particular supplier, an inability
to source raw materials of appropriate quality, or loss of a supplier where we are unable to find a suitable
alternative, may hinder our ability to fill customers’ orders on a timely and cost-effective basis or in the
required quantities, which could result in order cancellations, decreased revenue or loss of market share
and damage to our reputation. Further, volatility in costs and pricing can result in contractual disputes with
suppliers or an inability to contract on mutually satisfactory terms. Adverse resolution of any such disputes
or contract negotiations could have a negative effect on our results of operations.

We have in the past been affected by supply shortages due to external events, such as natural disasters, the
Covid-19 pandemic, supplier shutdowns and supplier manufacturing issues. In 2018 and 2019, we were
affected by supply shortages of 1,2-Benzisothiazolin-3-one (‘‘BIT’’) from China that resulted in our
implementing product allocations from April 2019 through March 2020 when all of our main sources of
BIT were online again. If we experience further supply shortages, or if any of our suppliers were unable or
unwilling to supply us with the raw materials required, we could experience disruptions in production. Such
disruptions could result in substantial delays if we are not able to find suitable replacement raw materials
on commercially viable terms.

The supply contracts for the raw materials that we acquire are typically one year or longer in duration. The
majority of our raw materials are global commodities with short lived price differences between regions
due to the logistics, cost and time to store and ship products from one region to another. As a result, while
we retain monthly flexibility to buy spot and contract volumes, our ability to influence the pricing
mechanisms in our supply agreements may be limited.

Many of our suppliers have operations that are subject to the environmental, health and safety risks
associated with the use of hazardous materials. Any environmental or health and safety incidents affecting
these suppliers may result in significant regulatory actions, fines and other penalties, including restrictions,
prohibitions or sanctions on their operations. Such consequences in turn could impair their ability to meet
their obligations to us under present or future supply agreements.

The key terms of the supply contracts for the raw materials that we acquire generally include hardship
clauses and provide some flexibility to negotiate, and although we can modify such terms to better reflect
current business conditions under certain contracts, there is a risk that this flexibility will be insufficient to
adapt our contracts to prevailing business conditions, or in a way that is suitable to us, or at all. As a
general matter, if a supplier is unable to meet our obligations under present delivery agreements with us,
we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain
limited cases, may not be able to obtain the raw materials at all, which could materially adversely affect our
business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_The chemicals industry, generally, and the specialty chemicals industry, to a lesser extent, as well as the end markets_**
**_that our products serve, are subject to cyclicality, which may cause fluctuations in our results of operations._**

Historically, the chemicals industry, as a whole, and the specialty chemicals industry in particular, to a
lesser extent, have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply conditions,
followed by periods when substantial capacity was added resulting in oversupply, and our future results of
operations may continue to be affected by this cyclicality and variability. We are also affected by cyclicality
in the industries in which our end customers operate. For example, our Material Protection market field
was impacted by a reduction in fracking industry activity due to the decrease in oil and gas prices in early
2020. Additionally, certain of our customers, such as agricultural industry customers for our Crop
Protection market field, are in industries that experience seasonality.

43


-----

Several factors that have historically contributed to volatile results in the chemicals industry, and in our
business, most of which are beyond our control, include:

- exchange rate fluctuations for producers with a global manufacturing footprint or distribution;

- oversupply due to unforeseen capacity expansions by existing or new competitors;

- short-term utilization rate fluctuations due to planned and unplanned shutdowns;

- regulatory requirements driving required technology and manufacturing changes; and

- political and economic conditions, which drive rapid changes in prices for our key raw materials.

Uncertainty in the global economic environment (which could result in lower demand) and the
implications of the variable supply and demand balance in the chemicals industry may result in increased
supply, which could increase pressure on our margins and could materially adversely affect our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, industry-wide capacity constraints,
driven by strong demand or other factors, may lead to a rise in sales prices for our raw materials and
therefore to a corresponding rise in the prices of our products, which could cause our existing customers,
for certain products, to switch to substitutes or to reduce the quantities of our products they purchase,
which could also materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_The outbreak of Covid-19 has had and may continue to have a negative impact on the sales and operations of some_**
**_of our market fields._**

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, Covid-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020,
the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities
around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19. The outbreak of Covid-19
and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged
closures of workplaces and other businesses and the related impact from closure of supply chains,
customers and associated reduction in consumer demand have had, and may continue to have, an impact
on our performance.

In 2020, our sales volumes in some market fields such as Material Protection, Paints and Coatings and
Crop Protection in Microbial Control Solutions and Composite Materials and pyromellitic dianhydride
(‘‘PMDA’’) in Specialty Chemicals Solutions were impacted by weaker end market demand, the closure of
certain of our key customers and disruptions in certain parts of our supply chain, including the temporary
shutdown of certain of our sites due to government stay-at-home measures. However, our professional
hygiene, home and personal care and wood protection market fields in the Microbial Control Solutions
business unit, as well as our Vitamin B3 products, experienced resilient levels of demand. Although this
increased demand acted as a hedge against decreases elsewhere in the business, there can be no assurance
that areas of increased demand will be sustained. As the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to
evolve, the outbreak may continue to have a negative impact on our performance.

We have taken precautionary measures, and may take additional measures, to minimize the risk of the
Covid-19 pandemic on our employees and operations, including encouraging employees to work remotely
where possible. The increase in remote working may create additional operational risks for us, including
risks related to employee productivity, satisfaction, mobility, tax, and training.

Although it is too early to estimate, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of these disruptions,
including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be determined by
the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the
Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the
pandemic. Further, the Group may be impacted by the effect that similar disruptions have on its suppliers,
vendors, distributors and customers.

Although we believe that in the medium to long term, the outbreak of Covid-19 is not likely to have a
material adverse effect on our operations, it is impossible to predict the full impact and duration of the
Covid-19 pandemic on our operations going forward due to a variety of variables including (but not limited
to) ongoing lockdowns in various countries in which we operate, the availability of essential onsite
personnel, the trajectory of new cases and variants around the world, the length of time that preventative
measures are maintained, the efficacy of various governmental stimulus packages and the global economic
recovery, the timeframe for approval and widespread distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and the extent to

44


-----

which customer behavior is permanently impacted. To the extent the Covid-19 pandemic adversely affects
our business, liquidity and results of operations, it may also have the effect of intensifying many of the
other risks described in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section. The spread of Covid-19 may also cause other
unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition. Any future epidemics may also have similar, or more severe, effects on global economic activity
and on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Any future acquisitions may prove difficult for us to consummate and we may carry out acquisitions which may not_**
**_deliver anticipated benefits._**

Our strategy may involve opportunistic acquisitions from time to time. We may continue to acquire
companies or assets in the future if we identify appropriate acquisition targets or divest assets to streamline
our business. It is possible that we identify the targets that are not appropriate for our business or that we
pay more to acquire the target than the value we are able to realize from it. Any acquisition that we make
could be subject to a number of risks, including:

- problems with effective integration of operations;

- the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;

- increased operating costs;

- costs related to achieving or maintaining compliance with laws, rules or regulations;

- the loss of key employees of the acquired company;

- exposure to unanticipated liabilities; and

- difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.

In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, despite the due diligence we perform, we may encounter
performance, funding or cash flow issues with the acquired business or inadvertently or unknowingly
acquire actual or potential liabilities or defects, including legal claims, claims for breach of contract,
employment related claims, environmental liabilities, hazardous materials or liability for hazardous
materials or tax liabilities. If any of the above were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

Further, we may use debt financing for any acquisitions, which would increase our debt service
requirements, or we may use operating cash flows to finance acquisitions, which would decrease our
retained earnings and the amount of cash on our balance sheet. In order to manage any acquisitions we
successfully complete, we will need to expand and continue to improve our operational, financial and
management information systems.

If making acquisitions or integrating any acquired business diverts too much management attention from
the operations or our current businesses, this could adversely affect our financial condition or results of
operations. Any acquisition we consummate may not ultimately provide the benefits we originally
anticipated. Furthermore, we may not succeed in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or financing,
if necessary, on favorable terms.

In addition, our management and resources may be distracted during any acquisition or divestment
planning and implementation process. This may reduce the capacity to pursue other business
opportunities, cause a delay in other projects currently contemplated by our management or lead to an
increase in the number of operational risk events, such as the level of administrative errors. A decline in
production standards or a fault or interruption in production during the divestment process may result in
an increase in customer complaints and customer and/or regulatory actions, which may lead to reputational
damage and the loss of our customers or business and ultimately have an adverse impact on our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our sales to third parties are concentrated among a limited number of product groups and customers. If the market_**
**_for these product groups changes, or if customers benefit from increased negotiating power, our revenues may_**
**_decline._**

We rely on a limited number of product groups and customers for a large percentage of our sales to third
parties. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2020, our largest customer accounted for 12.4% of
our sales to third parties and our top ten customers accounted for 34.4% of our sales to third parties. Our

45


-----

three top selling product groups accounted for 13.1%, 9.3%, and 8.6% of our sales to third parties,
respectively. Our three top selling products accounted for 3.2%, 2.7%, and 2.5% of our sales to third
parties, respectively.

If there is any disruption in the demand for these products, whether as a result of changes in our customer
base, delays or deferrals of key projects by customers, alternative products being developed, the entry of
significant competitors to the marketplace or otherwise, our revenues could decline. In addition, any
increase in our customers’ negotiating power or their use of their power to exert pressure on our prices
may adversely affect profitability. This could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_Our operations require the use of several different currencies exposing us to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations_**
**_that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to repay indebtedness._**

Our business is subject to risks normally associated with international operations, including currency
fluctuation risks and local business risks. Our reporting and functional currency is the Swiss franc while we
generate sales, incur costs and have assets and liabilities in other currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar,
euro, pound sterling and Chinese yuan. In addition, prices of the raw materials we procure, even if
denominated in Swiss franc, are frequently based on other currencies, such as the U.S. dollar or euro.
Fluctuations in the prices of any of the currencies that we use could have a material impact on our
business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Exchange rate fluctuations have also had a
significant impact on our reported sales to third parties in the past. For example, in the year ended
December 31, 2020 our reported sales to third parties of CHF1,655 million were CHF95 million lower than
our sales to third parties on a currency-adjusted basis of CHF1,750 million, which was attributable in large
part to a depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc.

In the absence of hedging, currency fluctuations between the Swiss franc and the currencies of the various
markets in which we operate may affect our results and make it difficult to compare performance levels in
those markets from year to year. If the Swiss franc appreciates (or depreciates) against another currency,
the Swiss franc value of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses initially recognized in that other
currency will decline (or increase). To partially offset this exposure, we will utilize cash flows that arise in a
given currency to pay for expenses arising in the same currency wherever possible, and we may also engage
in certain limited hedging transactions. However, there can be no assurance that these strategies will be
sufficient to effectively limit the increased impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our
results of operations.

Our international subsidiaries typically report in local currencies rather than in Swiss franc. As a result,
strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro, U.S. dollar, pound sterling or other applicable local
currency will result in a decrease in our revenue as reported in Swiss francs, which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, local subsidiaries
may incur costs in, and generate income in, currencies other than their respective reporting currencies,
exposing them to foreign currency transaction risk. Moreover, a significant proportion of our assets and
liabilities are also in currencies other than Swiss franc, and assets and liabilities are translated into the
Swiss franc at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date for inclusion in our consolidated
financial statements.

In addition, a significant proportion of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than
the Swiss franc. As a result, to the extent that the Swiss franc declines in value against the currency in
which capital expenditure is to be incurred and we do not have sufficient cash flows in the respective
currency to make such capital expenditure, the effective cost of making such capital expenditure may be
higher.

Any significant adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Conducting operations and sales in several different countries exposes us, and our facilities to various_**
**_macroeconomic and regulatory risks within each jurisdiction._**

We sell and market our products in over 120 countries across the world and currently have 18
manufacturing facilities and 13 R&D centers across six continents, including in Switzerland, the United
States, the United Kingdom, the People’s Republic of China, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, South
Africa, New Zealand and Australia. We employ sales staff and agents strategically located around the

46


-----

world to serve our global customer base. Our business is therefore subject to risks related to the differing
legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks
inherent in international operations include exposure to the following:

- unexpected or adverse changes in laws or regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions;

- adverse changes in the general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which we
operate;

- difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights;

- compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions becoming burdensome;

- increasing transportation and other shipping costs, delays or interruptions;

- variations in business practices;

- the imposition of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of other
restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls and import and
export licensing requirements;

- the complexity of managing competing and overlapping tax regimes;

- instability and disruptions caused by actual or threatened export duties, quotas and tariffs and
difficulties in obtaining export licenses;

- staffing difficulties, national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes;

- the threat of government expropriation;

- region to region fluctuations in key raw material costs;

- difficulties in staffing and managing operations;

- the imposition of any price controls or anti-dumping rulings;

- litigation risk and possible loss contingencies arising from Covid-19 and its adverse effects, including
commercial contract disputes, employee matters, contract counterparty insolvency, force majeure,
insurance claims and other arrangements;

- the imposition of government restrictions on movement or gatherings; and

- difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables.

The occurrence of any of the above could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of
operations or financial condition.

We have operations in developing countries such as the People’s Republic of China, Malaysia, South Africa
and Brazil, and we may expand our business and operations into other high-growth emerging markets. Our
operations in developing countries are subject to the risks inherent in operating in such jurisdictions,
including legal and regulatory uncertainties (such as difficulties in securing intellectual property rights),
political instability or conflict, as well as rapid changes in economic or political conditions in emerging
markets, which may result in greater risks of inflation, fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, and
a negative impact on the demand for our products.

As a result of our global operations, we are subject to laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions.
These include trade laws, competition and antitrust laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions,
anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to
anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and the US Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and other international laws and regulations. Failure to control, for example,
anti-competitive behavior, bribery and corruption, or breaches of trade sanctions could result in substantial
penalties, including civil and criminal liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation. Our international
operations could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the
United States or other governments or organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union
and their member countries.

If any of the risks described above materialize, it could materially adversely affect our business, prospects,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our manufacturing facilities are subject to operating risks._**

We are dependent on the continued operation of our manufacturing facilities, which include 18 sites across
six continents. These facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing, handling, storage,
and transportation of chemical materials and products, including tank and pipeline leaks and ruptures,
explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor
difficulties, accidents, exposure to hazardous substances, transportation interruptions, and environmental
risks. For example, in 2015 one of our facilities experienced a sudden pressure increase during cleaning
that required it to be closed for three months for repairs. In 2020, Hurricane Laura impacted our site in
Lake Charles and caused an electrical power shortage. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of
life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, and environmental contamination,
which could lead to fines or work stoppage injunctions, cleanup costs and lawsuits. As part of our regular
maintenance of our facilities, we may also be required to shut down our facilities for a certain period of
time. For example, we typically shut down our manufacturing facility in Visp for regular maintenance every
two and a half years. Should maintenance be required more frequently, or should shutdowns be required
for longer periods, this would have an adverse effect on our sales and operating results. The occurrence of
material operating problems at any of our facilities may diminish or eliminate our ability to manufacture
products or harm our customer goodwill. Further, from time to time, we may experience capacity
limitations in our manufacturing operations. If we are unable to effectively forecast our customers’
demand, it could affect our ability to successfully manage such operating capacity limitations.

**_Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the retention of requisite permits_**
**_related to our operations could result in significant ongoing costs and may result in further obligations and_**
**_liabilities associated with our businesses._**

We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, we will be subject to a number of continually changing and
increasingly stringent local, state, and international environmental and health protection requirements
with regard to, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the use, handling and disposal
of chemicals and hazardous substances. Compliance with such regulations can require significant
expenditures (including for remediation and containment work) and a breach may result in the limitation
or suspension of production or subject us to material monetary fines and penalties, civil or criminal
sanctions, or other liabilities. Such remediation work can last indefinitely and we are typically reliant on
third-party contractors to conduct such remediation. Furthermore, environmental laws may expose us to
liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, and some environmental laws provide for joint
and several strict liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment, which could result in
liability for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault. Environmental legislation is
evolving in a manner that is expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and
increased liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs for compliance.
Environmental laws and regulations may result in an increase in our costs of operations.

The environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits that govern our operations tend to
become increasingly stringent over time, including as a result of increasing public scrutiny of
environmental issues, and we could in the future assume additional obligations and therefore incur
substantial incremental costs to ensure our continued regulatory compliance. The pace of change together
with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintentional noncompliance. If we do not accurately
predict and adequately provision for the amount or timing of costs of any future compliance or if we
misinterpret our obligations under any of these regulatory changes, we may find ourselves in violation of
environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or permits. Given the nature of our business, violations
of environmental, health and safety requirements, whether current or future, may result in substantial fines
or penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions, clean-up costs and other remediation or
restoration requirements, claims for personal injury or property damages, the installation of costly
pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities.
The impact on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition in any period in which
such costs need to be incurred could be material.

**_We may be subject to ongoing costs and regulations related to contamination or exposure impacts from our_**
**_operations or products._**

Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities.
Some environmental laws, regulations and court decisions impose liability on present and former owners,

48


-----

operators or users of, or the generators of waste disposed at, facilities and sites for contamination at such
facilities and sites without regard to causation, negligence or knowledge of contamination. Historically,
environmental assessments of certain of our sites have revealed recognized environmental conditions and
from time to time, our internal audits have shown instances of regulatory noncompliance and
recommendations of remediation. There are significant costs associated with such remediation as well as
with general compliance with increasingly stringent environmental regulations. The discovery of previously
unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at
or in connection with our facilities, could result in substantial costs.

While we are protected by contractual indemnities from prior owners or operators against some
environmental liabilities related to known contamination or have insurance coverage relating to such costs,
there is a risk that we will be unable to recover all potential costs under such indemnity provisions or
insurance contracts in all cases. If we dispense of sites, we may also indemnify subsequent owners or
operators against some environmental liabilities and contamination remediation for sites that we formerly
operated. We could be required to establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations
or liabilities and, if we fail to accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impacts on
our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition in any period in which such costs need
to be incurred could be material.

**_Maintaining compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to both our products and raw materials_**
**_could adversely affect our business._**

We must comply with a broad range of regulations relating to the authorization, testing, manufacturing,
labelling and safety analysis of our products or the products of our suppliers. In some jurisdictions,
including the United States and the European Union, these types of regulatory controls and restrictions
have become increasingly demanding and we expect that this trend will continue.

In particular, our products and raw materials produced in, exported from or imported into and/or sold in
the European Union are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing
the registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. We are subject to Regulation (EC)
No. 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 18, 2006 (as amended)
concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (‘‘REACH’’), as well
as Regulation (EU) 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 22, 2012 (as
amended) concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (‘‘BPR’’). Both
regulations impose significant obligations on the chemicals industry with respect to the authorization,
testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of substances and mixtures under REACH as well as
biocidal products. REACH is reviewed on a regular basis and, as a result, new regulations that further
impact our businesses and operations may be proposed and implemented in the future. Moreover,
Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 16, 2008 (as
amended) on classification, labelling and packaging (‘‘CLP’’), imposes obligations in relation to the
classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals. Test procedures required by REACH and BPR can be
costly and time-intensive and may lead to a rise in production costs. Moreover, the use of certain chemicals
in production could be restricted, which would make it impossible to continue manufacturing certain
products. While we pursue research and development in substance characterization and in the possible
substitution of critical substances, the inability to use certain chemicals under REACH and certain biocidal
products under BPR could have a negative impact on our business, prospects, results of operations or
financial condition. See ‘‘Regulation.’’

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have registered all substances currently required to be
registered under REACH. However, the registration of new products produced or imported as well as
ongoing compliance with the applicable regulations may cause additional costs. In connection with
REACH and CLP requirements, any raw material, chemical or substance, including our products, could be
classified as having a toxicological or health related impact on the environment, on users of our products
or on our employees.

We do not expect the applicable chemical safety regulations affecting our UK operations to change
materially as a result of Brexit, although we expect a slight increase in compliance costs due to the
expected duplication of regulatory requirements.

In the United States, biocide products constitute ‘‘pesticides’’ or ‘‘antimicrobial pesticides’’ as such terms
are currently defined under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (‘‘FIFRA’’), as
amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. FIFRA is the principal federal statute governing the

49


-----

manufacture, labelling, handling and use of pesticides. LSI maintains several hundred product registrations
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (‘‘EPA’’). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain
efficacy, toxicity and labelling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in
which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. We are subject to ongoing risk in
maintaining our registrations and other product authorizations.

We manufacture, market and sell antimicrobial products, including ingredients for soaps and rubs, and
anti-dandruff ingredients that are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (‘‘FFDCA’’).
These products must conform to product and labelling standards set forth therein and must be
manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (‘‘cGMPs’’). Additionally, we
manufacture, market and sell a range of ingredients for the formulation of cosmetics and personal care
products, including ingredients for the preservation of formulated products and ingredients that contribute
to other product functionalities. In the United States, these ingredients are regulated under the FFDCA.
In the European Union, these ingredients are regulated under (Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of November 30, 2009 on cosmetic products, as amended). We
are subject to ongoing risk in complying with these regulations, and failure to do so could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

In the United States, our operations are subject to federal and state regulation of chemicals, including the
Toxic Substances Control Act (‘‘TSCA’’). On June 22, 2016, legislation significantly amending TSCA was
enacted into law. TSCA allows screening of our products by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(‘‘EPA’’), which increases the risk of screening that may lead to a range of regulatory obligations and/or
restrictions, including a possible prohibition on manufacture and sale.

Similar regulations and requirements apply in other jurisdictions in which we operate or into which we sell
our products.

Any changes in chemical safety regulations, delays in regulatory decisions due to Covid-19, changes in our
ability to provide input to regulatory bodies in a timely manner, or changes in the cost of compliance with
such regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and changes in rules and regulations governing our products could_**
**_adversely impact our business._**

The process of seeking regulatory approval of certain new products and production processes can be
time-consuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays, and such approvals may be granted
untimely or ultimately not granted at all. Any delay in obtaining (including as a result of the Covid-19
pandemic), or any failure to obtain or maintain, these approvals would adversely affect our ability to
introduce new products, to continue distributing existing products, and to generate revenue from those
products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or
financial condition.

In addition to the laws and regulations currently applicable to our products, new laws and regulations may
be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs, confiscation, recall or
monetary fines, any of which could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our
products.

Many of our customers are subject to similar regulations. If a significant customer or group of customers
were to have an important permit, license, registration or authorization revoked, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

We are also exposed to global import and export tariffs as a result of our international operations. Any
imposition of tariffs may affect our costs of obtaining raw materials necessary to our business. Any changes
in the laws and regulations and tariffs to which we are subject, including the discontinuation of any tariff
incentives that we currently use, could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_The loss of key customers for certain products could materially affect our business._**

Although we do not rely on any single customer for a substantial portion of our revenues, sales of certain
of our products depend on long-term agreements with certain key customers. If we lose any key customers,

50


-----

we may be unable to find alternative buyers to purchase the same products in the same quantities, if at all,
at similar price levels and/or on the same terms.

Across much of our business, some of our largest contracts typically have minimum volume requirements,
although in practice we usually try to find a solution with our customers if they cannot meet these
requirements. Within any given product type or end market we may rely on a small number of key
customers. For example, in our CDMO market field, we rely on key customer relationships which are
managed by global key account managers. Additionally, our Visp site is connected to a major customer
through a physical pipeline. If this customer were to discontinue our relationship, the lost business
delivered through that pipeline would be difficult to replace. While we do not anticipate the loss of our key
customers, we may lose customers due to, among other things, industry consolidation, customer
dissatisfaction or competition, which could lead to a significant increase in inventories or decrease in our
revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial
condition.

We face certain risks relating to the loss of customers as we do not always enter into long-term contracts
with our customers. While we have long-term supply agreements in place with many of our key customers,
in certain businesses, much of our business is conducted on a purchase order basis rather than through
long-term contracts. Accordingly, some customers may elect to discontinue business with us with limited or
no notice and with limited recourse. Additionally, certain of our product lines contribute
disproportionately to our profitability. Thus, the loss of customers for these products could have a material
adverse effect on our financial results.

**_We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from non-payment or non-performance by our customers._**

Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to minimize or mitigate customer credit risk and
our customers may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations.
These and other financial problems that may be experienced by our customers, as well as potential
financial weakness in our industry, may increase the risk in extending trade credit to customers. A
significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us to
limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that
customer’s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer, all of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We have limited control over our joint ventures and other similar business arrangements, which may impede the_**
**_strategic role of these entities within our operations._**

We have made, and may continue to make, investments and acquisitions and enter into joint ventures. Our
ability to control these joint ventures or receive dividends, royalties and other payments from joint
ventures generally depends not only on the joint venture’s cash flow and profits, but also upon the terms of
the joint venture agreement with our partners. There is a risk that the steps that we have taken to protect
our interests in joint ventures, have not been, or will not be, effective. Further, there is a risk that our
relationships with our joint venture partners will deteriorate in the future and result in a significant
disagreement.

The success of joint ventures and other similar arrangements is not always predictable and we may not
realize our anticipated objectives. The bankruptcy, insolvency or severe financial distress of our business or
those of any of our partners could adversely affect our joint ventures or similar business arrangements.
Should these joint ventures not perform as expected we may be unable to execute on our expansion
strategies as anticipated, and may incur losses or other liabilities that could adversely affect our financial
condition or results of operations.

**_Developments in the EU, market perceptions concerning any uncertainties or instability with regard to the future of_**
**_the UK’s relationships with the EU or the future of the euro and the Eurozone could have adverse consequences for_**
**_us._**

On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on its membership in the EU, in respect of which a majority
of those who voted in the referendum voted in favor of the UK leaving the EU (‘‘Brexit’’). On March 29,
2017, the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the process of formally leaving
the EU, and on January 31, 2020, the UK withdrew from membership in the EU and entered into a
transition period which expired on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the majority of rights
and obligations associated with membership in the EU continued to apply to the UK. On December 24,

51


-----

2020, the EU and UK announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on future relations
between the EU and the UK (the ‘‘EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement’’). On December 31, 2020,
the UK implemented the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force
provisionally on January 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations between the
UK and the EU, including the legal rights and obligations for businesses in certain industries not covered
by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.

A significant amount of EU law in matters ranging from employment law to data protection to competition
and other regulation is currently embedded in UK law either as a result of EU regulation directly
applicable in the UK or from UK regulations implementing EU directives. Accordingly, it is also unclear
what impact Brexit will have on the UK legal and regulatory landscape, which could in turn have a
significant impact on our business, including the operation of our Huddersfield site. There may also be
consequences for UK nationals working for us in the EU and EU nationals working for us in the UK.
Although it is not possible to fully predict the effects of Brexit, it could have a material adverse effect on,
amongst other things, our UK operations, our regulatory compliance costs, transportation and distribution
costs and taxation. Brexit has resulted in increased tariffs on some products sold from the EU into the UK
and has also impacted transportation availability, delivery times and our warehousing. As a result, the exit
of the UK from the EU may have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of
operations or financial condition.

Our sales to the U.K. accounted for 2.7% of our total sales to third parties for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition, our Huddersfield production site and Blackley and Castleford research
and development sites are located in the country. There is uncertainty as to the medium-term and
long-term effects of Brexit on economic development in the UK. To the extent that the performance of the
UK economy declines, does not improve or improves only over an extended period of time, our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

Since 2010, global markets and economic conditions have been negatively impacted by market perceptions
regarding the ability of certain EU member states (each a ‘‘Member State’’ and collectively, ‘‘Member
**States’’) to service their sovereign debt obligations, including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.**
Concerns persist regarding the outcome of the European Union governments’ financial support programs,
the possibility that other Member States may experience similar financial troubles, the overall stability of
the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political
circumstances in individual Member States. The impact of Covid-19 on the domestic economies of each
Member State has varied, as has the rate of recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic of each Member State.
Certain Member States have been, and may continue to be, more greatly affected by the economic and
social effects of Covid-19 than other Member States, which could lead to further instability in the
European Union.

These and other concerns have caused macroeconomic disruption, instability in financial markets and a
weakening of the exchange rate of the euro against other world currencies and may in the future also lead
to additional calls for referenda on membership or the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or
more Member States, or, in particularly dire circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely.
The occurrence of any of these circumstances could have a negative effect on our results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We may incur litigation-related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to our product quality._**

Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials and we have been from time to time, and in the
future may be, subject to claims made in relation to our property and operations or for personal injury.
While we do not currently have any material exposure in terms of environmental, health and safety
litigation, from time to time contractors or employees have been harmed during the course of their
employment. Injuries to contractors and employees may occur in the future.

From time to time, we have been subject to various claims, proceedings and lawsuits related to products,
services, contracts, employment, environmental, safety, intellectual property and other matters arising out
of our business operations or the business operations of our predecessors. Most of such claims and lawsuits
have related to allegations of personal injury associated with chromated copper arsenate (‘‘CCA’’), a wood
preservative, and wood warranty claims filed under Arch Treatment Technologies’ residential wood limited
warranties. Whether founded or unfounded, if any such claims, proceedings, or lawsuits are not resolved in
our favor, they may result in significant financial liability, negatively impact our business operations, and

52


-----

harm our reputation. The costs of investigating and defending against claims can be substantial and the
insurance we have may not be adequate. Further, the cost and ultimate outcome of litigation and other
proceedings, including remedies and damage awards, cannot be predicted.

In addition, we may be subject to litigation and the cost or the ultimate outcome of such litigation or other
proceedings, including remedies or damage awards, cannot be predicted. Adverse results in any litigation
or other proceedings may materially harm our business. Litigation and other proceedings may include, but
are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, environmental,
health and safety, joint venture agreements, labor and employment or other harms resulting from the
actions of individuals or entities outside of our control.

Our products have widespread uses in a wide variety of end-markets. Product quality and reliability are key
elements of our competitive position and we may lose customers and potentially be liable for regulatory
penalties or damages for any quality issues. Our suppliers and customers may use and/or generate
hazardous materials, and we may be required to indemnify our suppliers and customers or waste disposal
contractors against damages and other liabilities arising out of the production, handling or storage of our
products or raw materials or the disposal of related wastes. Some of our products are subject to cGMPs,
and we must maintain quality standards to acceptable levels for compliance with cGMPs. See
‘‘—Maintaining compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to both our products and raw
_materials could adversely affect our business.’’_

Furthermore, we have in the past, and may in the future, be named as defendants in product liability
claims. Were any such product liability claim or series of claims arising out of these various uses
(particularly where the value of such claims are in excess of our insurance coverage, applicable
indemnification agreements, or any provision we made), to be successful against us, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. We could be
required to increase our debt or divert resources from other investments in our business in order to
discharge any such claims, or might not be able to cover such claims at all. Additionally, new discoveries
about the safety of our products may be made in the future and such discoveries may lead to a substantial
decline of the sale of any affected products, both of which could materially affect the profitability of our
operations.

More generally, in the chemicals industry, products are subject to public scrutiny and may become the
target of environmental protests and campaigns, which, in turn, could lead the public to develop a negative
perception of certain of our products, which could materially affect sales and volumes of such products.

**_We may fail to develop new, commercially viable products or find sufficient commercial use for those products that_**
**_we have already developed._**

Our business is partially driven by the continuous development of new and innovative products, including
environmentally sustainable products and manufacturing processes. We operate 13 R&D centers across
our key geographical regions of EIMEA, APAC and the Americas, with over 200 full-time employees
dedicated to research and development as at December 31, 2020.

A significant amount of capital needs to be dedicated to develop new products, for which the process is
lengthy and results are uncertain. See ‘‘Business—Research and Development and Regulatory Assurance.’’ In
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred aggregate R&D expenses of
CHF50 million, CHF48 million and CHF35 million, respectively. In addition, we incur development costs
in connection with the production of our new products, as well as other activities that facilitate their
commercialization. As a result, future results of operations depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to
develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The product
development, manufacturing and commercialization process is time-consuming. We must develop, test and
manufacture our products as well as successfully register them in each relevant jurisdiction. All of our
products must meet and continue to comply with regulatory and safety standards in each of the markets
they are to be commercialized. Delays in the development process, or in the issue of the regulatory
approval could impact the expected profitability of the product, which in turn could adversely affect our
business.

Our products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as
expected or may face greater than expected competition. In addition, our new products may be unable to
achieve their planned value. Successfully developing and manufacturing new products also depends on our
ability to secure, on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, the required raw materials.

53


-----

It is difficult to estimate the commercial success of new products unproven in the marketplace. Potential
new products that appear promising during the development stage may fail to reach the market or have
only limited commercial success. This could be attributable to any number of factors, including efficacy or
safety concerns, an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in certain geographic markets,
difficulties in manufacturing or excessive manufacturing costs, erosion of patent terms as a result of a
lengthy development period, infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others or an
inability to differentiate the product adequately from our competitors. Any failure to develop commercially
viable products or to develop additional uses for existing products could make us less competitive and
could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

If our expectations for the market performance of our products launched in the prior five years are not
realized, we may be unable to recover development costs or to keep pace with the innovations of new or
existing competitors, we may lose existing customers or be unable to attract new customers, any of which
could reduce demand for any of our key products and may have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to adjust our products or technologies to address our customers’ changing requirements or_**
**_competitive challenges in a timely manner, and our customers may substitute our products with other products._**

The market segments where our customers compete are subject to periodic technological changes, ongoing
product improvements, product substitution and changes in customer requirements. Increased competition
from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a
similar functionality to our products may negatively affect demand for our products. We work to identify,
develop and market innovative products on a timely basis to meet our customers’ changing requirements
and competitive challenges. However, if we are unable to substantially maintain or further develop our
product portfolio, customers may elect to source comparable products from competitors, which could have
a detrimental impact on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

Our research and development teams work closely with our customers to develop high-quality, innovative
products and applications that are designed to meet their specific requirements. See ‘‘Business—Research
_and Development and Regulatory Assurance.’’ However, we may not be able to develop products that_
adequately address our customers’ needs. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are
developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, industry
acceptance or insufficient industry size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and
difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays
could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

Alternative materials, procedures or technologies may be developed, or existing ones may be improved,
and replace those that are currently offered by us. If such newly developed or improved products are being
offered at lower prices, have preferable features or other advantages, particularly from a regulatory
perspective, and we are not able to offer similar new or improved products, we may lose substantial
business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_The occurrence of major operational interruptions or problems at our facilities could have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our level of asset utilization, as well as our overall business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our results of operations are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and the
maintenance of high levels of asset utilization, the transport infrastructure that carries supplies to them
and the ability to complete planned construction, capacity expansion and maintenance projects on
schedule. In particular, operation of such production facilities is subject to hazards inherent in chemicals
manufacturing and the related use, storage, transportation and disposal of raw materials, products and
wastes, including:

- severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, floods, extreme temperature
fluctuations or any other natural or man-made disaster or other adverse weather conditions;

- explosions and other accidents, including pipeline leaks and ruptures;

- human error or mechanical failures;

- unplanned production downtime;

- transportation interruptions;

54


-----

- negligent actions of third parties;

- external security threats such as terrorism or sabotage aimed at disrupting our production facilities;

- unpermitted discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; and

- other environmental, health, safety and security risks.

Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions,
the hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw
materials, products and wastes are inherent in our operations. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental
contamination, discharge or injury resulting from those materials. These hazards can cause personal injury
and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, delays in the transportation of
products, as well as environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition
of civil and criminal liabilities, including penalties and damage awards. See ‘‘—We may incur litigation_related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to our product quality’’ above._

We also have scheduled shutdowns at our production facilities in order to perform necessary inspections
and testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry out maintenance that may be
necessary. Scheduled shutdowns may require longer downtime than anticipated. Unscheduled shutdowns
may occur due to technical failure or other reasons.

Extended downtime at any of our major operating facilities, whether as a result of a scheduled shutdown or
otherwise, could reduce rates of asset utilization and undermine our ability to maintain high production
volumes and meet our commitment to customers, which could materially adversely affect our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Any significant interruption occurring from time to
time in operations at our facilities, including interruptions caused by the events described above, may be
beyond our business continuity plans and may exceed the limitations of our current insurance coverage, see
‘‘—Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes in
_our insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial position or_
_our results of operations’’ below, and thus require increased capital expenditure, and may materially reduce_
the productivity and profitability of a particular production plant, or our business as a whole, during and
after such interruptions. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could adversely affect our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our success depends on the continued service of certain key personnel._**

A significant part of our continued success is dependent on our ability to retain the services of our
management team, directors and senior management, including business area managers, heads of certain
corporate or business functions, regional sales and country managers, market development and research
and development experts, as well as key technical specialists and project managers.

In addition, our future growth and success also depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate
skilled managerial, sales, administration, operating and technical personnel. We generally have
employment agreements with, but we do not maintain any ‘‘key man’’ life insurance for, members of our
senior management. The loss of one such key personnel, or the failure to attract and retain additional key
personnel, could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations or
financial condition.

Further, to the extent we lose or fail to attract or retain employees or key personnel as a result of the
Acquisition or our separation from the Lonza Group, there could be a material adverse impact on our
business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to carry out acquisitions or mergers due to regulatory restrictions on business acquisitions and_**
**_mergers or we may become subject to antitrust regulations as a consequence of our position in certain markets._**

Future acquisition opportunities and mergers may require approvals from antitrust authorities under
antitrust regulation in force at the time in any one of a number of jurisdictions. Furthermore, as a
consequence of our strong positions in certain of our markets, we may be considered by antitrust
regulatory authorities to have a dominant position which could subject us to certain limitations in our
ability to act on the market by adjusting our prices or otherwise. If such approvals of a proposed
acquisition or merger prove necessary, approval of the transaction may require, based on the relevant
antirust authority’s evaluation of prevailing market conditions and our position in the market, that it divest
certain businesses in order to carry out the transaction. We may also be prohibited by antitrust authorities

55


-----

from carrying out transactions. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our ability to execute
our strategy and our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights._**

Proprietary protection of our products and processes is important to our business success and competitive
position, and we have an extensive portfolio of registered patents and trademarks. Our actions to protect
our proprietary rights may be insufficient to prevent others from developing similar products to ours.

Despite our efforts, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the
same extent as do the laws of Switzerland, the United States or the European Union. Furthermore, any
pending patent application filed by us may not result in an issued patent, or if such patents are issued to us,
such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive
technologies. The expiration of a patent or the failure of our patents to protect our formulations,
processes, apparatuses, technology or proprietary know-how could result in intense competition, with
consequent erosion of profit margins. In addition, our competitors and any other third parties may obtain
patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully manufacture and market our products in a
competitive manner, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations
or financial condition. Certain of our patents are expected to expire within the next two years, including
those related to our Carboquat� and Dricon� products in our Wood Protection market field, our
Carboshield� products in our Material Protection market field, our SYNETH� products in our Home and
Personal Care market field as well as our monoethanolamine (‘‘MEA’’) based products in our Hygiene
market field.

In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change, the confidentiality of patent applications
before their publication (typically 18 months from filing) and/or uncertainty in predicting the outcome of
proceedings relating to the ownership or the scope of protection of patents relating to certain technologies,
competitors may be unexpectedly issued patents that we do not anticipate. These patents could reduce the
value of our commercial or pipeline products or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which we
have unknowingly relied, require us to seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology and we cannot
ensure that we would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or at all.

We also rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation,
along with other trade secrets, to develop and maintain our competitive position. Third parties (including
our competitors) may develop such knowledge or technology independently without violating our trade
secret rights. While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third
parties to protect our intellectual property:

- our confidentiality agreements may be breached;

- such agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary
know-how; or

- adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these
trade secrets and know-how.

Insufficient protection of intellectual property may limit our ability to make use of technological
advantages or result in a reduction of future profits. This may cause competitive restrictions and have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_If we are sued for infringing on intellectual property rights of third parties, it may be costly and time-consuming, and_**
**_an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business._**

The use of intellectual property may expose us to ongoing litigation, regarding either intellectual property
claims made by or against us. For a description of the risks inherent in being a litigation defendant, see
‘‘—We may incur litigation-related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to our product
_quality’’ above. We may spend significant time and effort and incur significant litigation costs if we are_
required to defend ourselves against intellectual property rights claims brought against us, regardless of
whether the claims have merit. If we are found to have infringed on the patents or other intellectual
property rights of others, we may be subject to substantial claims for damages, which could materially
impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be required to cease
development, use or sale of the relevant products or processes, or we may be required to obtain a license
on the disputed rights, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even where

56


-----

we initiate litigation, such legal activity is costly and may divert technical and management personnel from
their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, we may not prevail in any such litigation or proceeding. A
determination in an intellectual property litigation or proceeding that results in a finding of a
non-infringement by others of our intellectual property or an invalidation of our patents may result in the
use by competitors of our technologies or processes and sale by competitors of products that resemble our
products, which may adversely affect our ability to compete as well as create increased supply and
corresponding downward pricing pressure.

**_We may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions and breaches of cyber security. A_**
**_cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial_**
**_loss._**

The industries in which we operate have become increasingly dependent on information technology to
conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on information technology to perform many
of our services and to process and record financial and operating data. Further, we rely on the Lonza
Group to provide certain information technology services pursuant to the Global Services Agreement. See
‘‘Business—Material Agreements—Post-Acquisition Arrangements with Lonza—Global Services Agreement.’’
At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The technologies, systems
and networks utilized by us and our vendors, suppliers and other business partners may become the target
of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering,
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of
business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for
an extended period.

As a result of the social distancing measures and regulations enforced by governments in connection with
Covid-19, and the resulting work-from-home policies that we have undertaken, there has been additional
reliance placed on our IT systems and resources. The resulting reliance on these resources, and the added
need to communicate by electronic means, could increase the risk of cybersecurity incidents.

Our systems for protecting against information technology and cyber security risks may not be sufficient.
As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue
to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber
incidents. Additionally, we rely on our information technology systems for regulatory compliance,
including the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the ‘‘GDPR’’) and similar regulations
throughout the world, and if a significant or widely publicized unlawful disclosure of employee or customer
data were to occur, whether as a result of a failure of our information technology security systems,
employee negligence or the actions of our vendors, we may be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines
or other enforcement action.

Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems, network
disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our operational
efficiencies, delaying processing of transactions and inhibiting our ability to protect customer or internal
information. Our computer systems, including our backup systems, could be damaged or interrupted by
power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security
breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our
employees. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated
network security, backup systems and internal control measures, a system failure or data security breach
could occur and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Our business relies on hardware, software, equipment and services supplied by third parties._**

We have important relationships with certain suppliers of hardware, software, equipment and services.
Additionally, we will receive certain products and services from the Lonza Group pursuant to the Global
Services Agreement, Site Services Agreements and Supply and Tolling Agreements, including in relation to
general administration and business services, customs support, IT, procurement, real estate, human
resources, compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions), logistics and warehousing and others, to the LSI
Business, following the Acquisition. See ‘‘Business—Material Agreements—Post-Acquisition Arrangements
_with Lonza.’’ Our suppliers may, among other things, change service levels, extend delivery times, supply_
unreliable equipment, raise prices and limit or discontinue supply due to their own shortages, business
requirements, regulatory intervention, changes in trade policies or otherwise. Conversely, we may

57


-----

ourselves need to discontinue or reduce the use of products and services from particular suppliers due to
similar or other reasons, including with limited notice. Although we are not entirely dependent on
hardware, software and services supplied by particular suppliers, in many cases we longstanding
relationships with certain suppliers. This makes it more difficult to find replacement suppliers quickly in
the event that a supplier refuses to offer us favorable prices, ceases to produce the equipment we use or
fails to provide the services we require. In the event that products or services provided by third parties do
not meet our expectations, or if the suppliers are insolvent, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce
claims against them, in whole or in part. The occurrence of any of these risks may create operational
problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and could have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

We are also exposed to risks associated with the potential financial instability and business continuity issues
of our suppliers. If our suppliers were to discontinue certain products or services or interrupt the provision
of equipment or services to us, whether as a result of bankruptcy, regulatory actions, court decisions or
otherwise and if we were unable to procure satisfactory substitutes, it could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We require various licenses and permits to operate our business._**

We require various licenses and permits in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These licenses and
permits are generally subject to conditions stipulated in the licenses and permits and/or relevant laws or
regulations under which such licenses and permits are issued. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with
the stipulated conditions could result in the revocation or non-renewal of the relevant license or permit.

We continuously monitor and ensure our compliance with such conditions. Should there be any revocation
of any of our licenses and permits, or any failure to obtain or procure any necessary licenses and permits,
we may not be able to carry out our operations in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

**_Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes in our_**
**_insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial position or our results_**
**_of operations._**

Our plant, equipment and other assets are insured for property damage and business interruption risks,
and our business as a whole is insured for general and product liability risks. In addition, we carry marine
cargo insurance, cyber insurance, crime (including computer fraud) insurance, employment practice
liability insurance and director and officer liability insurance. However, such insurance may not cover all
risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and
maximum liabilities covered. For example, since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, many insurers have
reduced the scope of coverage for losses incurred due to pandemics. We may incur losses beyond these
maximum limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. If this occurs, and we face liability, our
business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. For
details of such potential liabilities, see ‘‘—The occurrence of major operational interruptions or problems at
_our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our level of asset utilization, as well as our overall business,_
_financial condition and results of operations’’ above._

Our insurance policies have historically been covered under Lonza’s insurance policies. Following the
Transactions, we expect to arrange new insurance policies for the LSI Business. Shifting to standalone
insurance policies for the LSI Business could lead to an increase in premiums and increased negotiating
power for our insurers, and may lead to changes in the scope of coverage of our insurance.

In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in our industries have not been
available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future,
we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and/or our premiums and deductibles for certain
insurance policies may increase significantly on the coverage that we currently maintain. If insurance is not
available at economically acceptable premiums, there is a risk that our insurance coverage does not cover
the full scope and extent of claims against us or losses that we incur, including, but not limited to, claims
for environmental or industrial accidents, occupational illnesses, pollution and product liability and
business interruption. Furthermore, we could be required to increase our debt or divert resources from
other investments in our business to discharge an uninsured claim. Costs associated with unanticipated
events in excess of our insurance coverage, or a failure to maintain such coverage could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

58

**_Our business could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in relations with our employees._**

As at December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,849 employees on a full-time equivalent basis.
63% of our non-management employees are covered by some form of collective bargaining arrangement at
site or national level or a works council agreement. In addition, a significant portion of our global
workforce resides in countries in which employment laws provide our employees with significant
bargaining power or other rights that may require us to spend more time and expenses when altering or
amending employees’ terms of employment or making staff reductions. Many of our employees in Europe
are represented by unions or works councils, which are represented on the board of directors by law and
generally must approve changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits.

We may not be able to renew any such collective bargaining agreements or work council agreements on
terms similar to current terms, or renegotiate such agreements on acceptable terms. Additionally, in
foreign jurisdictions where we operate, national unions and foreign governments may be unable to reach
agreements, which could result in work stoppages that are out of our control. Furthermore, if a collective
bargaining agreement or a works council agreement is negotiated at higher-than-anticipated cost, such
costs may need to be absorbed by us, or be passed through to customers in the form of higher prices which
may make us less competitive.

Further, a labor disturbance or work stoppage at any of our facilities as a result of any changes to our
employment terms and conditions or for any other reason could have a material adverse effect on such
facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There is
a risk that our employees could strike in the future, which could materially adversely impact our business,
prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely_**
**_affect the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our pension cost._**

Our pension costs and liability is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension
obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a
change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the
valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan
assets. Any change in key actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, would impact the valuation of
pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic
pension cost in the following financial years. Any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’ assets
could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels according to IAS 19
valuations or local regulations. Any decrease in interest rates will result in an increase of pension liabilities.
Our defined benefit pension scheme contains a high proportion of equity assets, which exposes the scheme
to volatility in equity markets and which may therefore result in significant fluctuations in the size of the
deficit. These effects may vary depending for local valuations as required by legislation. For example, Swiss
pension plans are obliged to build up a fluctuation reserve that absorbs such performance fluctuations to a
certain extent. As at December 31, 2020, the net defined benefit liability in our defined benefit pension
schemes stood at CHF167 million, calculated in accordance with IAS 19 (CHF190 million including U.S.
medical retirement plans). Our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of
applicable jurisdictions. For example, in Switzerland, in the event of termination of employees’ affiliation
with our pension fund, employees need to be consulted and agree to the termination. Contribution
amounts are based on plan performance, interest rates, and pension funding legislation, among other
factors. We cannot predict whether changing conditions including interest rates, pension assets
performance, discount rates, government regulation or other factors will require us to make future
contributions to the pension scheme, or whether we will have the funds necessary to make minimum
pension contributions at the times that they may be required. As a result, we may incur higher than
expected costs or other liabilities associated with funding the pension plan.

**_The value of our brand names or intangible assets could become impaired._**

As of December 31, 2020, our carrying amount of intangible assets, excluding goodwill, recorded was
CHF201 million. Our results of operations may vary due to the impairment of intangible assets relating to
the acquisition of acquired trademarks and licenses and acquired customer-related intangible assets. We
conduct annual assessments of the carrying values of intangible and tangible assets when impairment
indicators exist. As a result, declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact

59


-----

the fair value of our reporting units and result in an impairment in the value of brands or other intangible
assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities._**

Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions.
Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes,
including assessments of future earnings which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. In the
ordinary course of our business, there are various transactions and calculations, including intercompany
transactions and cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain
or otherwise subject to interpretation. We are regularly audited by tax authorities who may disagree with
our tax estimates or judgments. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final
determination of any such tax audits could differ from our historical income tax provisions and accruals
and any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final determination could have a material adverse
effect on our financial position. In addition, we are and may in the future become involved in proceedings
with national or regional tax authorities. While we attempt to assess in advance the likelihood of any
adverse judgments or outcomes to these proceedings or claims, it is difficult to predict final outcomes with
any degree of certainty.

In addition, changes in tax legislation or guidance could affect our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred
tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities. For example, on January 1, 2020, the Swiss Federal Act on Tax
Reform and AHV Financing (‘‘STAF’’) entered into force. The STAF provides, inter alia, for the abolition
of the cantonal tax privileges for holding companies, mixed companies and domicile companies, and for
the implementation of substitute measures such as a patent box and a surplus research and development
allowance. In connection therewith, in the canton of Basel-Stadt, certain substitute measures were
introduced as from January 1, 2019, including a reduction of the pre-tax statutory corporate income tax
rate to 13.04%. The overall Swiss tax effect per annum might be negative compared to our current tax
burden. We continue to assess and evaluate the impacts of these tax reforms on our business. As our
analysis of the recent tax reform and subsequent guidance continues, there can be no assurances that our
future financial results will not be adversely affected.

Any tax audit, tax proceeding or changes in tax legislation or guidance could, as a result of any of the above
risks, materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may have exposure to risks related to laws and regulations implementing OECD’s BEPS action points_**

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development together with the G20 countries have
committed to address abusive global tax avoidance, referred to as base erosion and profit shifting
(‘‘BEPS’’) through 15 actions detailed in reports released on October 5, 2015.

As part of the BEPS project, new rules dealing inter alia with double tax treaties abuse, the definition of
permanent establishments, controlled foreign companies and hybrid mismatch arrangements, are being
introduced into respective domestic law of BEPS member states via EU directives and a multilateral
instrument.

In effect, the European Council has adopted two Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (being, Council Directive
(EU) 2016/1164 of July 12, 2016 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the
functioning of the internal market (‘‘ATAD I’’) and Directive 2017/952/EU of May 29, 2017 amending
ATAD I as regards hybrid mismatch rules (‘‘ATAD II’’)) that address many of the above-mentioned issues.
The measures included therein have already been implemented into Luxembourg law on December 21,
2018 (the ‘‘ATAD I Law’’) and December 20, 2019 (the ‘‘ATAD II Law’’). Most of the ATAD I Law related
measures were applicable from January 1, 2019 and most of the ATAD II Law measures were applicable
from January 1, 2020. ATAD I Law and ATAD II Law may affect the Issuers, the holders of the Notes and
any intermediate entity or special purpose vehicle that has been or will be formed for the purpose of
holding one or more investments or the investments and could result in reduced returns to the Issuers and
hence the holders of the Notes.

At international level, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (‘‘MLI’’) was published by the OECD on November 24, 2016. The aim of
the MLI is to update international tax rules and lessen the opportunity for tax avoidance by transposing the
results from the BEPS project into more than 2,000 double tax treaties worldwide. A number of

60


-----

jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) have signed the MLI. The ratification process of Luxembourg has
been achieved through the law of March 7, 2019 and the deposit of the ratification instrument with the
OECD on April 9, 2019. As a consequence, the MLI will enter into force on August 1, 2019. Its application
per double tax treaty concluded with Luxembourg will depend on the ratification by the other contracting
state and on the type of tax concerned. Subsequent changes in tax treaties negotiated by Luxembourg
could adversely affect the returns from the Issuers to holders of the Notes.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS**

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks and, if it is not consummated, the Issuers will redeem the_**
**_Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest._**

On February 8, 2021, Swiss Holdco entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire, directly or
indirectly, from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target Companies and
certain other assets, together comprising the LSI Business. The Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of
certain closing conditions, including, customary antitrust and regulatory approvals and the performance of
certain closing actions. Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit
the gross proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Accounts on the Issue Date. The release of the
Escrowed Property is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the funds required to
pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within three business
days). As of the date of the offering memorandum, we do not yet know whether the Acquisition will be
successful.

If the conditions precedent to the Acquisition are not satisfied or waived, as applicable, by the Escrow
Longstop Date, then the Acquisition will not be consummated. If the conditions to the release of the
Escrowed Property, as more fully described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special_
_Mandatory Redemption’’ have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the_
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption as
described in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and you may not
obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes.

**_If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to_**
**_redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying_**
**_on the Escrow Equity Commitment._**

The Escrowed Property will be limited initially to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue
price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special_
_Mandatory Redemption.’’ In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such_
Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the SUN Issuer, in the case
of the Senior Secured Notes, and Luxco 3, in the case of the Senior Notes, will be required to fund the
relevant Issuer with an amount sufficient to cover the difference between the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property, including accrued interest and additional
amounts (if any) due with respect to the Notes from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date and any negative interest which has accrued on the Escrow Accounts, pursuant to the Escrow Equity
Commitment.

Holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must
rely on the Issuers’ respective rights to enforcement under the Escrow Equity Commitment. There can be
no assurance that the relevant entities providing such commitment will have sufficient funds to make this
payment, and the Issuers may not have access to the funds necessary to allow them to pay the full amount
of the required redemption price in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or financial
position of the LSI Business, or the terms of the Acquisition, between the Issue Date and the Escrow
Release Date, may have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your
decision to invest in the Notes as a result thereof.

**_The Issuers do not currently control the LSI Business and will not control the LSI Business until the Acquisition_**
**_Closing Date._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuers do not, directly or indirectly, hold any issued and
outstanding common shares of any entity included in, or any of the assets of, the LSI Business. As a result,
the Issuers’ ability to influence the LSI Business’s management is limited. In particular:

- The Target Companies’ management may not operate the LSI Business until the Acquisition Closing
Date in the same way that the Issuers and the Sponsors would.

- Much of the information contained in this offering memorandum relating to the LSI Business had to
be derived from public sources and, in the case of certain additional information relating to the LSI
Business, has been provided to the Issuers by the Target Companies, and the Issuers have relied on
such information that is publicly available or was supplied to them by the Target Companies in their
preparation of this offering memorandum.

- The Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from the
LSI Business’s management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the LSI Business’s
business. Likewise, employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition.

- In addition, the Target Companies’ management is required to manage the LSI Business under its own
responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interest of the LSI Business.

We cannot assure you that the Acquisition will be consummated given it is dependent on a number of
closing conditions, including receipt of antitrust and regulatory approvals. If we are not able to satisfy or
waive these conditions, as applicable, the Acquisition Closing Date will not occur and the Acquisition will
not be consummated.

**_The Sponsors’ opportunity to conduct due diligence with respect to the LSI Business was limited, and their due_**
**_diligence may not have revealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with the Acquisition._**

Before making investments, the Sponsors conduct due diligence that they deem reasonable and
appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objective of the due
diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of
an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that
may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. When
conducting due diligence, the Sponsors typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax,
accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment.
Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence
process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due
diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsors rely on resources available to
them, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third
party investigations.

Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or
corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in
certain jurisdictions.

There may be liabilities that the Sponsors failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations into the LSI Business in connection with the Acquisition. Following the
Acquisition, we may learn of additional information about the LSI Business that adversely affect us, such
as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any such
liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

We cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant
facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary
or helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in the LSI Business. We also cannot be certain that the
Sponsors’ due diligence investigations will result in the investment in the LSI Business being successful or
that the actual financial performance of such investment will not fall short of the financial projections the
Sponsors used when evaluating that investment.

62


-----

**_The Acquisition may entitle our customers and certain other business partners of the LSI Business to terminate_**
**_their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target
Companies and their respective subsidiaries. Counterparties under these agreements may be entitled to
terminate their agreements with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights,
which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_The LSI Business’s corporate structure has undergone substantial organizational changes in the context of the_**
**_carve-out and separation from Lonza, making it very challenging to transparently assess its past and future_**
**_performance and legal risks._**

The corporate structure of the entities forming part of the LSI Business has changed substantially in recent
periods in the context of the separation from Lonza and may change further, following the Acquisition
Closing Date. The operating companies of the LSI Business were previously held by different Lonza
companies. In order to facilitate the Acquisition, all companies and operating activities that are part of the
LSI Business were carved out of Lonza Group following its announcement on June 3, 2019 to proceed with
the Divestment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Lonza substantially completed the Carve-out
by (i) implementing operational changes to separate key functions, including supply chain activities,
customer facing roles and other critical functions; and (ii) establishing certain additional legal entities to
facilitate the organizational and legal aspects of the Carve-out.

As a consequence, past events that are described in the Offering Memorandum as having occurred with
respect to Lonza reflect events that occurred before we existed as a stand-alone business, and may not be
indicative of events that will occur following the Acquisition, when we operate a stand-alone business. It is
therefore difficult to assess the applicability or magnitude of risks disclosed in the Offering Memorandum
given that such risks are based on the performance of the various companies forming part of the LSI
Business when they were operating as part of Lonza rather than as part of a separate, stand-alone legal or
reporting entity. Similarly, it is difficult to predict our future performance following the Acquisition, given
that the historical financial information for us as presented in this Offering Memorandum reflects periods
that have occurred prior to our separation from Lonza.

The measures and share transfers implemented to reorganize the LSI Business may also have tax effects on
the LSI Business. Given the substantial value of the LSI Business and the complexity of the measures
taken, taxes relating to those measures could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

**_We may not successfully transition to operating as a standalone business._**

We have historically been a part of the operations of Lonza Group, which provided us with operational,
financial, and other support. As a result of the Transactions, we will become a standalone company and,
accordingly, must develop and implement the systems and infrastructure necessary to support our current
and future business. We cannot assure you that we will make the transition successfully. For example,
historically, certain of our accounting and information technology systems have been a part of Lonza
Group’s larger operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be errors, delays, or other related
issues resulting from the transition to a standalone company and adjustments to associated business
processes or that we will be able to fix any error or issue. Any such errors or issues could have a material
and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any delays in
implementing required systems may lead to increased operating expenses. See ‘‘—As we set up our own
_information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could incur substantial_
_additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.’’_

We will also incur costs in the future that have historically been part of Lonza Group’s larger cost
structure, including costs associated with health and welfare benefits for our employees, as well as internal
legal, tax, regulatory and treasury services. In particular, we will need to bear the cost of hiring any
additional employees as we transition to our target operating model.

Additionally, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs to operate as a standalone company will be
consistent on a forward-looking basis. Any failure to operate successfully within the terms of the applicable
Global Services Agreements, Site Services Agreements and Supply and Tolling Agreements with Lonza
Group, or to otherwise transition successfully to a standalone company, may cause us to incur substantial

63


-----

expenses in addition to the anticipated separation costs, and would have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

As part of Lonza Group, we benefited from Lonza Group’s corporate governance structure. As we
transition to operating as a standalone business, our corporate governance structure and board of directors
is not yet finalized. We expect to determine the composition of our board of directors and any board
committees following completion of the Transactions. We cannot assure you that we will develop an
effective corporate governance structure in a timely manner, or at all. If we fail to develop an effective
corporate governance structure or fail to do so in the expected time frame, there could be a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our transition to operating as a standalone company will require a significant amount of management’s
time and effort, which may divert management’s attention from operating and growing our business. If we
fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that are expected from becoming a standalone company, or do
not achieve them in the time frame expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

**_The Financial Statements are based on management judgements and a series of assumptions and estimates that_**
**_may prove inaccurate and not necessarily representative of the results the LSI Business would have achieved as a_**
**_stand-alone company._**

The LSI Business did not exist as a separate group prior to the Carve-out. It formed part of a larger group
of companies controlled by Lonza Group and was reported within the consolidated financial statements of
Lonza Group. Consequently, the Financial Statements were prepared to reflect the LSI Business as
historically included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of Lonza Group. Such combined
financial statements are, however, subject to certain limitations. For example, in order to reflect the assets,
liabilities, income, taxes and expenses that fall within the scope of the LSI Business, various assumptions
and estimates related to the Carve-out have been applied. Our management used significant judgement in
determining these assumptions and estimates, which may prove to be inaccurate or inapplicable to the LSI
Business on a stand-alone basis. As a result of the foregoing, the Financial Statements contained in the
Offering Memorandum do not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows
if the LSI Business had existed as a separate reporting group in the periods presented.

**_Services to be provided by Lonza to us based on existing service relationships may be insufficient to cover our needs_**
**_as a stand-alone company and we may be unable to subsequently replace the services provided by Lonza after the_**
**_Acquisition without operational problems or additional cost._**

We rely on, and after the Acquisition Closing Date will continue to rely on, ongoing service relationships
and agreements with Lonza pursuant to which Lonza has provided certain services to us in the past. These
services include, among others, accounting services, IT, procurement, intellectual property, treasury and
financing, human resources, legal and compliance. Following the Acquisition, Lonza will continue to
provide a reduced selection of these services to us, including, among others, services such as accounting
and risk services, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources, compliance tax (in certain jurisdictions)
and other related functions, under the Global Services Agreements, Site Services Agreements, Supply and
Tolling Agreements, for a transitional period from the Acquisition Closing Date. See ‘‘Business—Material
_Contracts—Post-Acquisition Arrangements with Lonza.’’ We expect that we will be dependent on these_
services provided by Lonza for the duration of the agreements pursuant to which they will be provided.
Following the Acquisition Closing Date we will continue to procure certain products from and will
continue to sell certain of our products to Lonza, pursuant to supply or tolling agreements and based on
ongoing business needs.

It is possible that such ongoing service relationships and agreements will be insufficient to cover our needs
as a stand-alone company or that the agreements pursuant to which they are provided may contain terms
and conditions that are not favorable to us or not competitive with alternatives in the market. Some of the
agreements also require us to source products from or sell certain of our products to Lonza on an exclusive
basis or to purchase certain minimum quantities from Lonza or pay certain minimum amounts if we do not
purchase the required quantities (take-or-pay). In addition, failure by Lonza to perform the services or
supply the products provided for under the service arrangements and other agreements, or the termination
of such agreements, may result in operational problems and increased costs to us. The services to be
provided by Lonza after the Acquisition may not function as efficiently as they did prior to the Acquisition
and we may find it difficult to find a suitable alternative supplier of such services or products in a timely

fashion or at all. Additionally, as part of the Lonza Group we benefited from certain economies of scale,
including with respect to our relationship with suppliers. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain
or build the independent relationships that are necessary for us to continue to benefit from such
economies of scale or operate our business successfully. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in connection with the Transactions_**

In connection with the Transactions, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and
expenses, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses,
reorganization and restructuring costs, severance and employee benefit-related expenses and other related
charges. In addition, we may incur significant one-time charges as a result of costs associated with the
Transactions. We will not be able to quantify the exact amount of these charges or the period in which they
will be incurred until after the Transactions are completed. Some of the factors affecting the costs
associated with the Transactions include the timing of the completion of the Transactions, the resources
required to transition the business to a standalone company and the length of time during which
transitional services are provided by the Lonza Group. There are also a large number of processes,
policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be developed in connection with the
Transactions. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred in connection with
the Transactions, there are many factors that could affect the total amount or timing of the integration and
implementation expenses.

There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Transactions that we do
not anticipate and may not be able to recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and
income we expect to achieve from the Transactions. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**_We may be exposed to taxation risks relating to the Carve-out._**

In connection with our separation from Lonza, shares and interests in legal entities have been sold and
transferred, contributed or distributed, as the case may be, to separate the activities of the LSI Business
from the other business areas of Lonza. See ‘‘—The LSI Business’s corporate structure has undergone
_substantial organizational changes in the context of the carve-out and separation from Lonza, making it very_
_challenging to transparently assess past and future performance and legal risks.’’_

The reorganization of the LSI Business may have adverse tax consequences in a broad range of other
jurisdictions due to the global nature of our business. Among other things, it is anticipated that indirect
transfers of shares (i.e. where shares in the shareholder of a specific entity are transferred) may be subject
to tax in various jurisdictions where we conduct business.

Lonza would be required, pursuant to the provisions of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, to bear certain
taxes relating to the reorganization of the LSI Business, subject to certain exclusions and limitations.
Should Lonza not have sufficient funds to settle its indemnification obligation vis-a-vis the LSI Business,
such liability would have to be borne by us, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.

Although we believe our tax estimates and positions with respect to our potential tax liabilities are
reasonable, the final determination of any such taxes is made by tax authorities, whose views could differ
from our estimates and positions. Any obligation to pay additional taxes beyond those anticipated and
budgeted for could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations or prospects.

**_Our market image may be influenced by Lonza’s image for a period after the Acquisition Closing Date and our new_**
**_brand may not appeal to our customers._**

We currently use ‘‘Lonza’’ as part of our product marks, corporate marks and as part of the company
names, business designations and domains to operate our business which is licensed from Lonza Group.
Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, we are required to make commercially reasonable
best efforts to introduce a new brand for our business within six months after the Acquisition Closing Date
and to stop selling Lonza-labelled products within twelve months after the Acquisition Closing Date.
Further, the existing licensing arrangement to use the mark ‘‘Lonza’’ will cease at the end of eighteen
months from the Acquisition Closing Date. Until we announce a new brand for our business, we could be
seen as still being connected to Lonza Group. Negative publicity or problems associated with companies of

65


-----

Lonza Group during this period, even if unrelated to us and our business, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or prospects.

Additionally, we cannot predict if our new brand, once announced, will appeal to our customers. Any
failure of our new brand in generating the expected brand recall with our customers could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or prospects.

**_As we set up our own information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could_**
**_incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions._**

After the Acquisition, our core IT infrastructure and systems will continue to be highly integrated with
Lonza Group. Lonza Group will therefore continue to provide IT services to us, including infrastructure,
license and application services under the Transitional Service Agreements (the ‘‘IT Services’’). Pursuant
to the Transitional Service Agreements, the IT Services shall continue to be provided essentially in the
same manner and scope as prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. However, we will seek to migrate the
provision of the IT Services to our own independent IT services, either internally or through third parties,
in order to support our critical business functions. This migration may result in our incurring higher
implementation and running costs than the current IT Services. Additionally, failure to migrate the IT
Services effectively and efficiently could result in operational interruptions, and could disrupt our business
and lead to third party claims (and consequential liability) which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the Note_**
**_Guarantees._**

Following the completion of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of December 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had
total financial indebtedness in the amount of CHF2,665 million, consisting of the Notes and Senior
Facilities. In addition, the LSI Business had lease liabilities of CHF14 million as at December 31, 2020. See
‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes.’’ We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for the
foreseeable future.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for the Issuers and their subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations with
respect to the Notes, the Senior Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating
rate of interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged;

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of
any future borrowings; and

66


-----

- limiting our ability to obtain additional capacity for issuance of bid, advance payment, performance
and warranty guarantees for operative business purposes and increasing the cost of any future
guarantee issuances.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our obligations, including under the Notes and the Senior Facilities.

**_The Issuers and the Issue Date Guarantors are holding companies that have no revenue generating operations of_**
**_their own and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the LSI Business to be able to make payments on_**
**_the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

The Issuers and the Issue Date Guarantors are holding companies with no business operations other than
management of the equity interests their holds in each of their subsidiaries. Following consummation of
the Acquisition, the Issuers and the Issue Date Guarantors will be dependent upon the cash flow from its
operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations,
including its obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Given our international operations, we
have a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to
our results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuers and the Issue Date
Guarantors will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of each of
those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss
transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuers’ subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be
permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuers to make
payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees. See ‘‘Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_Collateral.’’_

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Facilities and the
Senior Secured Notes limit the ability to upstream cash to the SUN Issuer subject to certain exceptions.
Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and
loss transfer agreements between several entities of the LSI Business may also limit the amounts that some
of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even
prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuers’ subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers
will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to
pay their respective debt when due. Certain holding companies for the LSI Business are organized under
Swiss law which provides that dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable
reserves, and, generally, interim dividend distributions are, for the time being, not allowed under Swiss law.
The subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments
with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees.

While the Indentures will limit the ability of the Issuers’ subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on
their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to
significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including_**
**_the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the ability
to borrow up to A375 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, and the Senior Facilities Agreement and
the Indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt thereunder. The Indentures and the Senior
Facilities Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from
security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be
structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the
Notes or such debt is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such
property and assets securing such debt, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the
Notes. Although the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will contain restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be
incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing
debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement
and the Indentures will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under
those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees.

67


-----

**_Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will be subject to restrictive covenants that will limit our_**
**_operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will contain covenants which impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements will limit our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ The_
covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital
needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with certain affirmative covenants
while amounts under the Senior Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances,
the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with a financial
ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.
See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.’’ Our ability to meet the
financial ratio under the Senior Facilities Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio thereunder,
could result in an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event
of default that is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to certain applicable
thresholds, cure rights and cure period, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior
Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities, together with accrued
interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Facilities, including our
failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration
provisions, including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities,
accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our
subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our
subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In
addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not be_**
**_able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior
Facilities and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will
depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the
success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal,
regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ many of which are
beyond our control.

68


-----

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to
fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under
the Senior Facilities. At the maturity of the Senior Facilities, the Notes or any other debt that we may
incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt
obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our
indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations
as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of
our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our
debt, including the Notes and the Senior Facilities, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial
position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to
dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from
such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient
cash to meet our obligations.

**_Some of our indebtedness, including the Senior Facilities, will bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Debt under the Senior Facilities will bear interest at a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered
Rate (‘‘EURIBOR’’) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘LIBOR’’) (or, for loans denominated in
sterling, the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (‘‘SONIA’’) plus a credit adjustment spread and, from
the date of any subsequent switch from LIBOR under the Senior Facilities Agreement in respect of loans
denominated in certain other currencies (including U.S. dollars), an applicable risk free rate plus a credit
adjustment spread) (in each case, subject to a zero floor if less than zero) plus an applicable margin. These
variable rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these
obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make
payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior Facilities Agreement nor the Indentures contain a covenant
requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount
(including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of interbank lending rates,
regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union have
conducted investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of
daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate
EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates
and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international
regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into

69


-----

force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration
of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted.
For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer
persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021.
Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that 26 LIBOR settings
will cease to be published after December 31, 2021 or, in respect of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR settings,
June 30, 2023). The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner
of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in
changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, will require an adjustment to the
terms and conditions, and may result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such
benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR,
SONIA and EURIBOR and, in respect of LIBOR, include mechanics to switch the variable rate element
of the interest rate applicable to loans in certain currencies (including U.S. dollars) to rates based on a risk
free rate applicable to the relevant currency plus a credit adjustment spread). Any such change, as well as
manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported
EURIBOR or LIBOR or any other variable rate and/or a change to the benchmark by reference to which
the interest on our floating rate debt is determined, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to
service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_The interests of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Giving effect to the Transactions, the Sponsors will indirectly own all of the shares of the Issuers and the
holding companies of the LSI Business. As a result, our shareholders have and will continue to have,
directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and
change our management and to approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of
matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may
conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable
to pay our debts when due. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional
indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire
and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also
pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our shareholders have held, hold or may hold
interests in suppliers or customers of the LSI Business. Our shareholders and their affiliates could also
have an interest in pursuing divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or
sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend
distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments,
although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

**_The Senior Secured Notes will not be initially secured by all of the SSN Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 150 days after the Acquisition Closing Date (if such event occurs at all),
the Senior Secured Notes will not be secured by all of the SSN Collateral, as further described under
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’ On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be
secured only, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on a first-priority basis, by security interests in the
SSN Issue-Date Collateral. We will agree in the Senior Secured Indenture to take such necessary actions to
secure the Senior Secured Notes within 30 or 150 days (as applicable) from (and excluding) the Acquisition
Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the
obligations under the Senior Facilities, by first-priority security interests in the SSN Post-Closing
Collateral. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens within
the time periods specified, the failure of which would result in an ‘‘event of default’’ under the Senior
Secured Indenture. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Senior
Facilities and otherwise as set forth under ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral,’’ which limitations could be significant. See_
also ‘‘—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital
_maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity_
_and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.’’ It should be noted that if a guarantee or a_
security interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured

70


-----

obligation arose, such guarantee or security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under
applicable local insolvency laws. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’_

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_**
**_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture and_**
**_the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with_**
**_proceeds from the enforcement of the SSN Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of
the SSN Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after
certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent is required to
apply turned over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward
discharging the super senior obligations (if any) (including, among others, (following the designation of the
Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement) those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness
that may be secured on a super senior basis (the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’)) in priority to applying any
such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As such, you may not benefit from amounts
recovered from an enforcement of the SSN Collateral if the then outstanding claims under such Super
Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement
sale of SSN Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged,
be applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior Term Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, (if the Revolving
Credit Facility has not been designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) the Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that ranks _pari passu_
with the Senior Secured Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior
Secured Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively
subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness.

**_The SSN Issuer, the Guarantors and the other SSN Collateral providers will have control over the SSN Collateral,_**
**_and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes will allow the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors
and the other SSN Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely
operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the SSN Collateral to the extent that it relates
to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the SSN
Issuer, the Guarantors and the other SSN Collateral providers may, among other things, without any
release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the SSN
Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the SSN Collateral and making
ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the SSN Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first
ranking basis with security interests over the SSN Collateral that will also secure our obligations under the
Super Senior Liabilities. The Senior Secured Indenture also permits the SSN Collateral to secure
additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the SSN Collateral as provided
for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee
or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the SSN Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Designation Date’’), the Security Agent may refrain from taking
enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in
respect of indebtedness ranking _pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain_
non-priority hedging obligations (the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Participations’’) which aggregate more than

71


-----

50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured
**Creditors’’) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior**
Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease
enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total
second lien credit participations (the ‘‘Majority Second Lien Creditors’’) (or, in certain cases, creditors
holding more than 50% of the total topco credit participations) (in each case acting through their
respective creditor representatives) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from taking enforcement action unless
instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at
that time (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance
with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the
obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of
enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority
Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as
to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of
the enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the
Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors will prevail until the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have been fully discharged.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent
to pursue and (ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing
enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security
Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or on the expected realization of enforcement proceeds
and (y) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the
enforcement principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement
objectives before the security agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the enforcement
instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred and its continuing with respect to any debtor (other than an
insolvency event directly caused by any enforcement action taken by or at the request or direction of the
creditors of Super Senior Liabililties), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in
accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to
first consult with any other creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority
Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from
the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the obligations under the Super Senior Creditors Liabilities have
been fully discharged.

The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability
in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority
or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or
security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of the Group. In connection
with any enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity
and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including
legal fees).

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Notes (such as indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of
Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous
for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells SSN Collateral
consisting of the shares of the SSN Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any
other assets of such entities securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released.

See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.’’_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the
Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Senior Secured Notes, you
will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors in the
event of a default. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SSN Collateral that will be granted as_**
**_security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not_**
**_secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SSN Collateral. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’ In addition, the SSN Collateral will also secure the
Senior Facilities and a portion of the SSN Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior
Notes on a second priority basis. Not all of our assets will secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Indenture will allow the SSN Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure any future Senior
Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the
Senior Secured Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Note
Guarantees) with the property and assets of the SSN Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries that do not
secure the Senior Secured Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of
default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured
Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will
rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the SSN Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the SSN Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes.

While the Senior Secured Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and
grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or
creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security
Principles. The Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture will set out
a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or
guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among
other things, the amount recoverable under any SSN Collateral provided being limited or security not
being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may
affect the value of the security or guarantees provided by the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_The value of the SSN Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Senior Secured Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the SSN Collateral,
the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the SSN Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the
SSN Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the SSN
Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges
will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a
going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly
sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other SSN Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because
most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us.
Likewise, we cannot assure you that the SSN Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be
substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we
operate may include restrictions on the persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and
consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our
business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold

73


-----

such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security
Documents, enforcement of the SSN Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain
jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be
challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a
result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the
SSN Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes
and it is possible that the value of the SSN Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of
indebtedness secured by such SSN Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to
secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited
value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares
that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must
first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors
secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an
enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the SSN Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the
SSN Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the SSN Collateral) would
have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the SSN Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
remaining assets.

The Senior Secured Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the SSN Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured
indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior
Secured Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies
with respect to the SSN Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we (or other members of the Group) issue
additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture or other indebtedness that is secured
on a _pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes, holders of such Senior Secured Notes or other_
indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the
same collateral as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your
ability to benefit from the liens on the SSN Collateral.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE SENIOR NOTES**

**_The SUN Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the SUN Collateral, and the sale of particular assets_**
**_could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Senior Notes will allow the SUN Collateral providers to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income
from the SUN Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has
occurred and subject to certain conditions, the SUN Collateral providers may, among other things, without
any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the SUN
Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the SUN Collateral and making
ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_Your right to receive payment under the Note Guarantees of the Senior Notes is contractually subordinated to senior_**
**_ranking debt of the Guarantors._**

The obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Note Guarantees of the Senior Notes (each, a
‘‘Senior Note Guarantee’’) are general senior obligations of such Guarantors and will be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all existing and future obligations in
respect of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor. Such debt includes the guarantees of the Senior Secured
Notes or, in the case of the SSN Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, and the obligations
under the Senior Facilities. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of
the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to
the Senior Note Guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture in respect
of an insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in
full from the assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Senior Note
Guarantee. Until the senior ranking debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which
holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in the

74


-----

Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor as
their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes
Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders
of Senior Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Senior Note Guarantee.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Note
Guarantees will provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of
the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor;

- that if a payment default on any senior ranking debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing,
such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Note Guarantee until such default
is cured or waived;

- that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking indebtedness that
permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default,
such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior
Note Guarantee, until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days
after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

- that, until the liabilities under any senior ranking debt have been fully discharged, the holders of the
Senior Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or, as the case may be, the Majority Second Lien
Creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain
circumstances.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the
Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior
Note Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict the
rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of
the Guarantors under the Senior Notes Indenture and by accepting any Senior Note each such holder will
be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior
Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the Senior Note Guarantees in the event of a default
by the SUN Issuer or a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture.

**_The Shared Collateral secures the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities on a first priority basis, and your_**
**_rights to recover on such Shared Collateral will be limited._**

A portion of the SUN Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will be pledged to the Security Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Senior Facilities, any provider to
the Senior Secured Group of hedging that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a ‘‘Hedge
Counterparty’’ and any provider of cash management facilities to the Senior Secured Group that becomes
party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a ‘‘Cash Management Facility Creditor,’’ as well as to the Security
Agent for the benefit of holders of the Senior Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations and cash
management facility liabilities are secured by first ranking security interests in the Shared Collateral and
the proceeds of any sale of the Shared Collateral on enforcement will be applied first to repay all debt of
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging
obligations and cash management facility liabilities. Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such
Shared Collateral because the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior
Facilities and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and cash management facility liabilities will
have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Shared Collateral.

**_The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SUN Collateral that will be granted as security_**
**_for the Senior Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior Notes._**

The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SUN Collateral described in this
Offering Memorandum. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Security.’’ In addition, a portion of the SUN
Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities and
certain hedging obligations and cash management facilities on a first ranking basis, and may secure
additional debt ranking senior to or _pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees._
Although (i) the pledge over the shares of the SUN Issuer, (ii) the pledge in respect of intercompany

75


-----

receivables owed by the SUN Issuer to its direct parent company Luxco 3 and (iii) the pledge of the
material bank accounts of the SUN Issuer will secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees
thereof on a first priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Facilities, such
pledge may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes, to the extent permitted by the
terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may
therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the SUN Collateral or a reduction of the SUN
Collateral securing the Senior Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds
of an enforcement of the Shared Collateral (and any other collateral securing the Senior Facilities and the
Senior Secured Notes) will be applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the
Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, liabilities owed to the lenders under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging
liabilities and cash management facility liabilities, among others, before repayment of the Senior Notes and
Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes exceed the value of the SUN
Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank
equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt ranking pari passu with
the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as SUN
Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes, those claims may not be
satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes
Indenture will allow the SUN Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt permitted
to be incurred under the Senior Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Notes and
the Senior Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure
the Senior Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs
and the obligations under the Senior Notes are accelerated, the Senior Notes and the Senior Note
Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the
holders of unsecured debt of the SUN Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or
assets that is excluded from the SUN Collateral securing the Senior Notes.

**_The value of the SUN Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the_**
**_Senior Notes and such SUN Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Notes, holders of the Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the
value of the SUN Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Senior Notes and, in respect of the Shared
Collateral, only after any holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Senior Facilities, and
the providers of senior secured hedging and cash management facilities have been paid in full. In the event
of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Senior Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets
underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the SUN Issuer’s obligations with respect to the
Senior Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of
the SUN Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the
pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is
sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an
orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of
buyers.

The SUN Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes may
provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be
liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that
the SUN Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation
thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate may include restrictions on the
persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate
our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only
permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of
potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the SUN Collateral and
any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory
consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may
take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary
shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the SUN Collateral may be significantly decreased.
Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Notes and it is possible that the value of the SUN Collateral
will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the SUN Collateral. With respect to
any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such
shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in

76


-----

relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose
shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the
pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover
anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the SUN Collateral may
decline over time. If the proceeds of the SUN Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the
Senior Notes, the holders of the Senior Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the
SUN Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the SUN Issuer’s and
the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Senior Notes on the SUN Collateral. To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or
third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture
or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the
SUN Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the
Senior Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of
such Senior Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Notes being offered
hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the SUN Collateral.

**RISKS RELATING TO EACH SERIES OF NOTES**

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to assets with sustainability_**
**_characteristics._**

Any potential provider of the Assurance Letter is not currently subject to any specific regulatory or other
regime or oversight. Any such Assurance Letter should not be deemed to be a recommendation by the
Issuers, the Guarantors or any member of the Group, the Initial Purchasers, the external reviewer
providing the Assurance Letter or any other person to buy, sell or hold the Notes. Holders of the Notes
will have no recourse against the Issuers, the Guarantors, any of the Initial Purchasers or the provider of
such Assurance Letter for the contents thereof. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the
relevance of any such Assurance Letter and/or the information contained therein and/or the provider of
such Assurance Letter for the purpose of any investment in the Notes. Any withdrawal of such Assurance
Letter or such Assurance Letter attesting that we are not complying in whole or in part with any matters
for which such Assurance Letter is opining on or certifying on may have a material adverse effect on the
value of the Notes and/or result in adverse consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to
invest in securities to be used for a particular purpose.

Furthermore, although the interest rates relating to the Notes are subject to upward adjustment in certain
circumstances specified in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’,
as applicable, the relevant series of Notes may not satisfy an investor’s requirements or any future legal or
quasi legal standards for investment in assets with sustainability characteristics.

In addition, the interest rate adjustment in respect of any series of Notes depends on our definitions and
calculations of Waste Intensity and GHG Emissions that may be inconsistent with investor requirements or
expectations or other definitions relevant to waste intensity and/or greenhouse gas emissions. If no
Assurance Letter is obtained, there might be no third-party analysis of our definitions or calculations of
Waste Intensity or GHG Emissions or how such definitions relate to any sustainability-related standards
other than the relevant external reviewer’s confirmation of our Waste Intensity levels and our GHG
Emissions produced as of December 31, 2024, each according to our definitions thereof. There currently is
no clearly-defined definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to, what
constitutes a ‘‘sustainable’’ or ‘‘sustainability-linked’’ or equivalently-labelled project or as to what precise
attributes are required for a particular project to be defined as ‘‘sustainable’’ or ‘‘sustainability-linked’’
(and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time). As a result, no
assurance is or can be given to investors by the Issuers, the Guarantors, any other member of the Group,
the Initial Purchasers or the external reviewer that the Notes will meet any or all investor expectations or
our targets qualifying as ‘‘sustainable’’ or ‘‘sustainability-linked’’ or that any other adverse impacts will not
occur in connection with our striving to achieve such targets. Investors should make their own assessment
as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of any opinion, report or certification of any
third party in connection with the offering of the Notes.

Although we have committed to reduce our (i) Waste Intensity by at least 12%, and (ii) GHG Emissions by
at least 18%, in each case by the end of 2024, there can be no assurance of the extent to which we will be
successful in doing so. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future investments we make in

77


-----

furtherance of these targets will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards
regarding sustainability performance, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental,
sustainability or social impact. Adverse environmental or social impacts may occur during the design,
construction and operation of any investments that we make in furtherance of our targets.

**_Not all of the Guarantors will initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors. We will agree in the
Indentures, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, to take such necessary actions so that the
Post-Closing Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee
supplemental indentures substantially in the forms attached to the Indentures within 150 days from (and
excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially
simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Term Facilities. For the
year ended December 31, 2020, on an aggregate basis, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated 62% of our
sales to third parties and 61% of our Adjusted EBITDA (excluding LSI intercompany transactions). As of
December 31, 2020, on an aggregate basis, the Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for 42% of our total
assets (excluding equity investments in subsidiaries and LSI intercompany transactions). The validity and
enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to certain
limitations. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of
_the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’ There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such_
additional Note Guarantees within the time period specified. The Issue Date Note Guarantees by the Issue
Date Guarantors and Post-Closing Note Guarantees by the Post-Closing Guarantors will be limited as set
forth in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’_

**_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the_**
**_incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security_**
**_interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Note Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of
shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance
periods in particular, as the Indentures will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of
the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The
applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each
new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or
recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in
such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See
‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Collateral.’’_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and
equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees thereof or the Collateral across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuers are organized under the laws of Luxembourg; the Issue Date Guarantors are organized under
the laws of Luxembourg, Switzerland, England and Wales and the United States; and the Collateral
includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated in those jurisdictions, certain bank accounts
of the SSN Issuer and the SUN Issuer in Luxembourg, certain bank accounts of Swiss Holdco, UK Bidco,
US Holdco and US Bidco and certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by Luxco 3,
the Issuers, and certain of their subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of
these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be
subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that
you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

78


-----

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuers and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United
States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability
to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of
these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of
any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note
Guarantees and the Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the_**
**_Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of each Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of
the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes
but to the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any
independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights
or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Trustee or Security Agent, as
applicable, including as may be provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be
deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have
limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such Collateral are
taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged
assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some
uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the
Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a Security Document will be validly secured. In
certain jurisdictions, including Switzerland, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation
and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the relevant Security
Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors owed to holders of the
Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (‘‘Principal Obligations’’). All or part of the pledges and
other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for
the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same
time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge
the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel
Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant Security Agent.
Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security
Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt
construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders
of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.
See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Collateral.’’_

In relation to the Security Documents governed by the laws of Switzerland which provide for a nonaccessory security interest (nicht-akzessorische Sicherheiten), the Security Agent will take, hold and
administer and, as the case may be, release and (subject to it having become enforceable) realize any such
security interests (including any and all benefits in connection with such Security Documents and any and
all proceeds of such security) on a fiduciary basis for itself (including as joint and several creditor and
creditor of the Parallel Debt) and for the benefit of the other secured creditors. In relation to the Security
Documents governed by the laws of Switzerland which provide for an accessory security interest
(akzessorische Sicherheiten), the Security Agent will take, hold and administer and, as the case may be,
amend, release and (subject to it having become enforceable) realize any such security interests (including
any and all benefits in connection with such Security Documents and any and all proceeds of such security)
for itself (including as joint and several creditor and creditor of the Parallel Debt) and as direct
representative (direkter Stellvertreter) in the name and on behalf of each of the other secured creditors and

79


-----

each present and future secured creditors authorizes the Security Agent to act as its direct representative
(direkter Stellvertreter) in relation to any and all matters in connection with such Security Documents.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with
respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of
these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the
relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes
against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in
the same Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent will be under any obligation or
responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security_**
**_Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically,
including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset
sale covenant of the Indentures and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Indentures will also permit us to designate one or more restricted
subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indentures, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such
subsidiary and any Note Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released under the Indentures, subject to
certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the
Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of
its subsidiaries. The Collateral and Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor may be released if that Guarantor is
not required to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. Under
various circumstances, the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released, including pursuant to the
provisions described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown.’’

**_The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations_**
**_on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes,_**
**_may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date or the Acquisition Closing Date, as applicable, our obligations under the
relevant Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the
relevant Collateral (the ‘‘Security Interests’’). The Issuers are organized under the laws of Luxembourg,
the Issue Date Guarantors are organized under the laws of Luxembourg, Switzerland, England and Wales
and the United States and the Post-Closing Guarantors are expected to be organized under the laws of
Switzerland, England and Wales and the United States. With respect to the Issuers and any Guarantor
organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable presumption that
the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ as defined in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of
the Council on May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’) is the
jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include pledges over the
shares in certain of the Issuers’ subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, Switzerland,
England and Wales and the United States, pledges of certain bank accounts in Luxembourg, Switzerland
and England and Wales and security interests in certain present and future intercompany loan receivables
held by the Issuers and Luxco 3, which is also incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, as well as
pledges of certain other assets in the United States and England and Wales.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the
Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuers’ subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance
and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuers, the enforceability
of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain
circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close
to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law,
although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the
relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the
Security Interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Issuers and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee
or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of
the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found
to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set
aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In
addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security
Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The
amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents will also be
limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note
Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See
also ‘‘—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Collateral.’’_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security
Interests created, the Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created
such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business
person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such
Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security
Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing
for insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note
Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were
incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some
other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note
Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other
reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s
or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would
incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due.

81


-----

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or
created any Security Interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due;

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts
and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or

- its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be
no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security
provider was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were
created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or
security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or
not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the
Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on
other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees
and Security Interests, see ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and_**
**_the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral._**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Luxembourg, Switzerland, England and Wales
and the United States. Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any
Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to
the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity
maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally,
particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable,
and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or
secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the
extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security
provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to
the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of
capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws
and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their
fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

The Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially
reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it.
This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is
possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other
insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may
contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s
Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note
Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant
Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all
liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or
security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Collateral.’’_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be

82


-----

offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non U.S. persons in
offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable
laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors
in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

**_The Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in
very limited circumstances. Owners of book entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of
Notes. The custodian for DTC or common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will be the registered holders of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of
principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will
be made to the applicable Paying Agent, which will make payments to DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold
book entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to
indirect participants. After payment to the custodian for DTC or the common depositary for Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents and the
Registrars will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to
the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry interest, they must rely on
the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not
participants in DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of
the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of
the Notes under the Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has
received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to
vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book entry interests, they
will be restricted to acting through DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures
to be implemented through DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the
timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a
negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The
Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the
Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market making activities at any
time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the

83


-----

U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active
trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including depositors,_**
**_trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of
non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuers, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the
creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of
the Issuers becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than
as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right
to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the
assets of such subsidiary before the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as
applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the
Issuers. In addition, the Indentures will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor
subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default
under the Indentures, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indentures will not contain any
limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by
these subsidiaries.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuers and the Guarantors (other than US Holdco and US Bidco) (together, the ‘‘Non-U.S.
**Obligors’’) are organized or incorporated outside the United States, and their business is substantially**
conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Non-U.S. Obligors are
non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the
Non-U.S. Obligors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action
under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the
directors and executive officers of Non-U.S. Obligors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of
the Non-U.S. Obligors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located
outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S.
courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Non-U.S. Obligors
may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Non-U.S. Obligors and the directors and
executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign
jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with Switzerland,
Luxembourg and England and Wales. For further information see ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of
_Civil Liabilities.’’_

**_The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuers may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer,_**
**_even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the respective Indenture) occurs, the Issuers will be required to make
an offer to purchase all the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
purchase. In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are

84


-----

tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely
have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain
such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory
prepayment under the Senior Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and
may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the
Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indentures, which would, in turn,
constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may
not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indentures.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated
net leverage ratio of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes in such tender offer and the relevant Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of
such Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the relevant
Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not
in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—
_Optional Redemption.’’_

**_The term ‘‘all or substantially all’’ in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning under_**
**_relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of control has_**
**_occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the respective Indenture,
the relevant Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The
definition of ‘‘change of control’’ in the Indentures will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to
any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ it
has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of
the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the relevant Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_We may dispose of certain assets or capital stock of entities in the Group._**

We may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or other transactions that, in our
judgment, would be beneficial to us, even if such transactions might involve risks to you as noteholders. For
example, pursuant to a carve-out from the restriction on assets sales for ‘‘specified asset dispositions’’ and
other provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures, we may, under certain
circumstances, sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of material assets of the Group and, if meeting
certain leverage ratios on a pro forma basis, distribute some or all of the proceeds therefrom to our
shareholders. Such a transaction would not constitute a change of control or a default under the terms of
the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Specified Asset_
_Disposition,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ and_
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Specified Asset Disposition’’. Additionally,
we may issue, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the capital stock of entities in the Group for purposes of
taking a dividend or distribution that would benefit us but not benefit you as a noteholder.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described in ‘‘Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown’’ and in ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Debt_

85


-----

_Pushdown’’), pursuant to which the Issuers are entitled to give notice that the terms of the Indentures and_
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’ and in ‘‘Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’)) will automatically operate so that,_
among other things, the references to such Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in ‘‘Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions’’ and in ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Definitions’’) (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in_
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown’’ and in ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—
_IPO Debt Pushdown’’) and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of the IPO_
Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the applicable Indenture.

In either case, such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes
as in place after such modifications (the ‘‘New Notes’’). If such modifications result in a deemed exchange
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or
loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed
exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined
under ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations’’) would be required to
include the original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New Notes are treated as
‘‘contingent payment debt instruments’’ as a result of the possibility of additional payments, as further
described under ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—
_Characterization of the Notes,’’ would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult_
their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications
of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown.

It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other than
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining
the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the
potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and
other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time.
No assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a
credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit
rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and
terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

Each Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of such Indenture, the Notes issued
under such Indenture receive an investment grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB or better
by S&P, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and
continuing until such time as such Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency,
certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status’’ and ‘‘Description_
_of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade_
_Status.’’ At any time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur_
additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction,
each of which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the
Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Exchange._**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance
that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuers cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and
the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or
maintain such listing, the Issuers may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the
Exchange. Listing of any of the Notes on the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the
Notes in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to
the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized
listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing of the Notes on the Official List
of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List
of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes
in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The Senior Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the
Senior Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant
changes in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors
over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in
the effective yield of the Senior Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a
U.S. dollar basis.

**_The Indentures will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indentures will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended (the ‘‘TIA’’) and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject to any of the
provisions of the TIA. Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided
under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting
preferential collections by the trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee. See ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes.’’_

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**_The Acquisition_**

On February 8, 2021, Swiss Holdco, an entity indirectly owned by Bain Capital and the Cinven Funds,
entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire from the Seller the LSI Business. We currently
expect the Acquisition to complete during the course of the second half of 2021. The consummation of the
Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary
antitrust and regulatory approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. Under the terms of the
Sale and Purchase Agreement, Swiss Holdco has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required
clearances following the signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. If closing has not occurred on the
date falling twelve months after the signing date of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Sale and
Purchase Agreement may be terminated. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ for the estimated sources and uses
necessary to consummate the Acquisition.

Under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, all related party financing arrangements (except for certain
related party loan arrangements denominated in U.S. Dollars) between Lonza Group and the LSI Business
will be terminated prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. In addition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement
provides for a set-off mechanism, pursuant to which, following such termination of related party financing
arrangements, certain net related party receivables or certain related party net payables between Lonza
Group and the LSI Business may remain outstanding. Such related party receivables or payables, if any,
will then be off-set against the purchase price for the Acquisition.

The Sale and Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Seller as to capacity, title
and certain business matters as well as customary signing to closing covenants given by the Seller
regarding, among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the LSI Business pending
closing of the Acquisition. The Seller’s liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds
and limitations. In addition, pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Seller has agreed to take
certain actions to facilitate the ability of the LSI Business to operate on a standalone basis, including,
subject to certain exceptions, the provision of a number of services pursuant to the Global Services
Agreement, Site Services Agreements and Supply and Tolling Agreements, including relating to accounting
and risk services, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources, compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions)
and others, to the LSI Business, following the Acquisition. See ‘‘Business—Material Agreements—
_Post-Acquisition Arrangements with Lonza.’’_

Further, the Seller has agreed that, for three years from the Acquisition Closing Date, neither it nor its
affiliates will engage in the territory in which LSI will directly or indirectly acquire, own, participate or
engage in the development, manufacture, marketing, sale or supply of products currently produced by the
LSI Business (or substantially or substantively similar to any such products) in any geographies where the
LSI Business is active or where the LSI Business had already invested, or had made substantial plans to
move into immediately prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuers and their subsidiaries will not have control over the
boards of directors of the Target Companies. Such boards of directors of the Target Companies and their
management will be required, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, to manage the LSI Business under
their own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interests of the LSI Business. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Issuers do not currently control the LSI Business and will not_
_control the LSI Business until the Acquisition Closing Date.’’_

**_Escrow Accounts_**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from
the offering of the Notes into the Escrow Accounts. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Escrow
Agent. See ‘‘Summary—The Offering—Collateral.’’

The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied
promptly (and in any event within three business days). See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of_
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ If these conditions are not satisfied on or before the Escrow_
Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of
the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to,

but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of_
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the_
_conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to_
_redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without_
_relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.’’_

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the SUN Issuer, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes,
and Luxco 3, in the case of the Senior Notes, will be required to fund the relevant Issuer in such aggregate
amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuers to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow
Account fees, negative interest on the Escrow Account balances and costs and accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption
date, pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter. The holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to
enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on the Issuers’ rights to enforcement under the
Escrow Equity Commitment. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory_
_Redemption,’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release_
_of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow_
_Account may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity_
_Commitment.’’_

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be CHF831 million (equivalent). The proceeds
from the Offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and the Equity
Contribution will be used to (i) fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition; (ii) refinance certain
existing debt; and (iii) pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

The estimated sources and uses of funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table
below. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual
Acquisition Closing Date, and the actual purchase price for the Acquisition, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates for amounts not denominated in Swiss francs, the amount of the Equity Contribution or
other sources made available and differences between estimated and actual fees and expenses. In
particular, the purchase price under the Sale and Purchase Agreement as shown below reflects the agreed
purchase price of CHF4,225 million, less estimated purchase price adjustments under the Sale and
Purchase Agreement of CHF263 million. These purchase price adjustments are estimated based on
amounts as of September 30, 2020 and include CHF252 million of unfunded liabilities (which include
pensions liabilities, other debt-like items, such as lease liabilities, tax payables and restructuring and legal
provisions, less other cash-like items) and other purchase price deductions, and CHF11 million of existing
debt (including short-term related party debt to Lonza Group and short-term debt to banks) that are
expected to be refinanced at the Acquisition Closing Date. These amounts may change depending on a
number of factors, including, among others, the timing of the Acquisition Closing Date. The final purchase
will be calculated based on the relevant purchase price reductions as at the first calendar day of the month
in which the Acquisition Closing Date falls, as provided for in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

The table below should be read in conjunction with ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ ‘‘Description
_of the Senior Notes’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

Notes:

(1) Represents the Swiss franc-equivalent of the aggregate amount we expect to draw under the Senior Term Facilities on or about
the Acquisition Closing Date.

(2) Represents the Swiss franc-equivalent of the estimated gross proceeds of US$350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes.

(3) Represents the Swiss franc-equivalent of the estimated gross proceeds of A460.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Notes.

(4) Represents the expected aggregate equity contributions (based on the agreed purchase price pursuant to the Sale and Purchase
Agreement) from the Sponsors, in the form of equity and subordinated shareholder funding. The amount of the equity
contributions from the Sponsors may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses are greater or less than our current
estimate or as a result of purchase price adjustments under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, and is inclusive of funding, if any,
from management.

(5) Represents the estimated purchase price payable to the Seller pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement on the Acquisition
Closing Date of CHF4,225 million, less estimated purchase price adjustments under the Sale and Purchase Agreement of
CHF263 million. These purchase price adjustments are estimated based on amounts as of September 30, 2020 and include
adjustments for: (1) unfunded liabilities in an amount of CHF213 million, consisting of pension liabilities and the net amount of
other debt-like items (comprised of lease liabilities, tax payables and restructuring and legal provisions) and cash-like items;
(2) a purchase price deduction of CHF38 million; and (3) CHF11 million in short-term related party debt to Lonza and
short-term debt to banks (as described below). The actual purchase price may change and will be calculated based on the
relevant purchase price reductions as at the first calendar day of the month in which the Acquisition Closing Date falls. As of
December 31, 2020, current debt owed to Lonza Group was CHF1,519 million. The purchase price will be paid in cash at
closing. The purchase price is comprised of an equity purchase price and the purchase of receivables for amounts owed to
Lonza Group by the LSI Business. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.’’

(6) Represents other financial debt, including short-term related party debt of CHF6 million to Lonza Group and short-term debt
of CHF5 million to banks, as of September 30, 2020. The actual amount at the Acquisition Closing Date may vary.

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including net interest expense that will accrue on
proceeds of the Notes deposited into escrow, underwriting, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other
transaction costs and professional fees.

party loan receivables denominated in US dollars which will be acquired on the Acquisition Closing Date, in each case,
pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

(7) Excludes lease liabilities. As at December 31, 2020, the LSI Business had lease liabilities of CHF14 million.

Statements. As adjusted total shareholders’ equity represents expected aggregate equity contributions (based on the agreed
purchase price pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement) from the Sponsors, in the form of equity and subordinated

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following tables present our selected historical financial information and have been derived from, and_
_should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS_
_and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial_
_and Other Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

_We have extracted the combined and carve-out historical financial information of the LSI Business for the years_
_ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 from the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum. As the LSI Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating_
_activities within the LSI Business were under the common control of Lonza Group, in each case, prior to the_
_finalization of the Carve-out, the historical financial information of the LSI Business presented in this offering_
_memorandum as at and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 has been prepared on a_
_combined and carve-out basis. In the year ended December 31, 2020, Lonza Group reallocated certain assets_
_and liabilities between its continuing business and the LSI Business, resulting in certain changes to the asset and_
_liability allocations to the LSI Business in the carve-out approach applied in the preparation of the 2019_
_Financial Statements. These revised allocations were presented to enhance comparability and were reflected in_
_the 2020 Financial Statements, including in the comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31,_
_2019. See Note 1.2 to the 2020 Financial Statements. Accordingly, figures as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019 included in the 2020 Financial Statements may differ from those included in the 2019_
_Financial Statements. Figures in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019_
_have been extracted or derived from the comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019_
_included in the 2020 Financial Statements. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Historical_
_Financial Information’’ and ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Basis of Preparation’’ and our_

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

We believe that the factors discussed below have significantly affected our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flow in the historical periods for which financial information is presented in this
offering memorandum, and that these factors will continue to have a material influence on our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flow in the future.

**_General economic conditions and demand in our end markets_**

The chemical industry generally and our addressable markets are impacted by general economic
conditions. Historically, demand has been generally correlated to GDP growth in our addressable markets
both regionally and globally.

We produce a diverse array of product types and specialize in microbial control for personal care as well as
for the protection of homes, schools, workplaces and environment from mold and other potential
pathogens and also offer custom development and manufacturing of specialty chemicals and composites to
support the electronics, aerospace, food and agrochemical industries. Our products have applications in a
variety of end markets, including electronics, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and oil and gas. While the
level of demand for each of our product types and in each of our end markets is affected by factors specific

97


-----

to that product type and that particular end market, certain overarching global trends have an impact
across the product types and end markets. These include demographic changes such as population growth,
longer life expectancies and urbanization, as well as the impact of an increasing global focus on energy
conservation and green products. Demand for our customers’ end products is also affected by
macroeconomic factors, such as the correlation between demand for construction products and
infrastructure spending and economic conditions. The fluctuations in demand for our customers’ end
products in turn affects the demand for our products. For example, 2019 was a challenging year for our
electronics business, as a combination of slower economic activity and ongoing reduction in demand for
electronics depressed demand for our composite material products, as well as for our vitamin B3 sales due
to reduced demand for nutritional feeds due to African swine fever impacting livestock populations in
China.

Demand for our products also varies in the geographic regions that we serve. Historically, demand in
Europe and North America has been driven by changes in demographics, customer requirements for
high-quality products and stringent health and safety regulations. Demand in developing regions has been
driven by demographic factors, such as population growth (through a growing middle class, in particular),
ongoing industrialization and urbanization, as well as infrastructure spending.

**_Raw materials and product pricing_**

Raw material prices can be volatile and comprise the largest portion of our costs of goods sold,
contributing 65.8%, 63.6% and 62.2% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The nature of our markets, as well as our market positions and differentiated product offerings, allow us to
manage the majority of our exposure to raw material price fluctuations by generally passing through
increases in the prices of raw materials to our customers.

Key raw materials are based on petrochemical feedstocks (predominantly liquefied petroleum gas propane
and naphtha, durene, PMDA, acetone, acetic acid and beta picoline), ethylene (predominantly synthetic
fatty alcohols and ethylene oxide), copper (predominantly copper metal, copper carbonate, and copper
oxide), and chrome ore (predominantly chromic acid). Many suppliers operate globally with some focusing
on a regional approach. Prices of the majority of raw materials (by cost) are in part dependent on crude oil
prices but are also influenced by supply and demand of each product. Supply contracts are normally
entered into on a one to three-year basis with price adjustments on a monthly or annual basis. We buy raw
materials either under these supplier contracts or via the spot market, depending on which is more
favorable. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our top five raw materials by expenditure were LPG/
LVN, acetone, chromic acid, copper carbonate and copper metal, which comprised 4.5%, 3.9%, 3.9%,
3.8% and 3.5%, respectively, of our total raw material costs for the period.

Our pricing approach and the pricing provisions in our customer agreements vary across businesses and
market fields. Depending on the market field and customer, our customer agreements may include price
adjustment provisions which allow us to adjust prices based on certain factors, including without limitation
raw material prices and energy costs. In these cases, we may be able to pass through corresponding
increases in selling prices subject to lag time, and on the other hand, declines in raw material prices have a
direct impact on our sales to third parties. Some of our customer agreements include pricing terms which
restrict our ability to adjust pricing if certain purchase volumes are achieved.

Generally, in our Microbial Control Solutions business unit, our product pricing is based on the value we
provide to customers, including with regards to regulatory approvals, and therefore not necessarily directly
correlated with raw material costs. For products in our Specialty Chemicals Services business unit, for
which product pricing tends to be more directly correlated with raw material costs, we may have price
adjustment provisions to allow us to adjust prices based on certain factors such as raw material prices.

In order to minimize the risk of higher raw material prices, we hedge the commodity price risk for propane
and naphtha via financial hedges, whereas for other areas we rely on our ability to pass on raw material
price increases to customers through sales price adjustments. Approximately 20-30% of our naphtha and
propane raw material expenditure is not hedged.

**_Regulatory requirements_**

In all jurisdictions in which we operate, our products and services are subject to laws, rules, regulations and
technical standards at international, supranational, national, state and municipal levels. In particular, this
regulatory framework governs the design, manufacture, installation, operation and product safety of our

98


-----

products and services, and is mainly outlined in applicable industry standards and industry-made
regulations, including ISO and cGMP standards. In addition, we are subject to regulatory requirements
concerning product standards for energy efficiency and sustainability.

These and other applicable laws are amended and revised from time to time, typically in ways that increase
the technical and safety standards applicable to products manufactured after their effective date. Such
amendments and revisions may require us to update our product designs and creation procedures to
ensure our products qualify for the necessary operating licenses and otherwise comply with the new
requirements. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant, impacting our operating and
compliance costs and thereby our results of operations.

The costs of regulatory compliance are incurred throughout our business, such as in new product
development, product registrations and product modifications to adapt to regulatory requirements in
various jurisdictions.

Changes in regulations affecting our customers’ wide range of activities often have an impact on demand
for our products. For instance, sales volumes of molluscicides have decreased in the EU since regulations
have reduced the concentration of metaldehyde allowed in their formulations since February 2020.
Regulators have also increased scrutiny of zinc pyrithione, which is used in anti-dandruff products, in
particular in the EU and Canada.

At the same time, regulation is a key driver of sales in our Microbial Control Solutions business, as we
believe we have a leading regulatory expertise in all of our key markets. For instance, in the Hygiene
market field, regulatory developments in Europe and North America are expected to lead to a reduced
number of suppliers in the market and further strengthen our position. In the Paints and Coatings market
field, we have strong regulatory competency in keeping markets open for customers in an environment of
decreasing numbers of permitted biocides. See also ‘‘Regulation—EU and UK Regulations—Industry and
_Product Related Regulations—Biocides and cosmetics—BPR and the Cosmetics Directive.’’_

**_Environmental considerations_**

Our operations are subject to extensive and continuously evolving environmental laws and regulations.
These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture, storage, handling, treatment,
transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges and air emissions
including greenhouse gases. We have invested, and will continue to invest, financial and technical resources
in order to achieve and maintain compliance with environmental requirements. Environmental
considerations can also impact the markets in which we operate, including our position with respect to our
competitors.

The main regulations relating to the safe use of substances and chemicals affecting our industry are the
BPR regulation in the European Union and FIFRA in the United States, and to a lesser degree the
REACH regulation in the European Union and TSCA in the United States, which impose significant
obligations on the chemicals industry with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of
substances. The obligations imposed by these and other regulations are expensive and time-consuming and
lead to increased production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. In addition, we
may also incur costs in connection with the restoration and decommissioning of former manufacturing
sites. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, our aggregate capital expenditures on
compliance with environmental laws and regulations amounted to CHF7 million, CHF16 million and
CHF16 million, respectively, which represented 7%, 17% and 18% of our capital expenditures for the
relevant years. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, our aggregate operational expenses
on environmental, health and security (‘‘EHS’’) concerns amounted to CHF9 million, CHF11 million and
CHF15 million, respectively, while our capital expenditures on EHS amounted to CHF20 million,
CHF30 million and CHF31 million, respectively.

We are committed to principles of environmental responsibility and are at the forefront of sector
innovation by responding to market developments, delivering tailored solutions. This includes an
increasing focus on the environment and sustainability, including, for example, the production of the
Tanasote preservative, an innovative oil-based alternative to traditional creosote. We have invested and
plan to continue to invest in a catalytic converter at a continuously running plant at our Visp site to reduce
our nitrous oxide emissions at that plant by 98% per annum by the end of 2021. We expect this investment
to total approximately CHF12 million between 2019 and 2022, with CHF6 million of this investment
conducted in the year ended December 31, 2020. See also ‘‘Regulation.’’

**_Coronavirus pandemic_**

The outbreak of Covid-19 and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition
of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses, and the related impact from
closure of supply chains, customers and associated disruptions in consumer demand has had various
impacts on our performance.

Our Microbial Control Solutions business unit has generally performed well during the Covid-19
pandemic, as many of its products are actively used in the global effort to control this ongoing public health
crisis. In particular, 16 of our formulations have been recently approved by the EPA to be labelled
‘‘efficacious against SARS-CoV-2’’. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic was the primary driver of growth in
sales to third parties of the Hygiene market field from CHF170 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to CHF265 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or by 55.9%. In addition, the Home and
Personal Care market field saw increased interest in its preservation and laundry offerings. However,
various social restrictions resulted in reduced market demand for skin care, hair care and food products, all
of which are addressable end markets of the business unit’s Home and Personal Care market field.
Paintings and Coatings, Material Protection and Crop Protection market fields all had reduced sales to
third parties due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit has been more severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The pandemic’s negative impacts on transportation and demand for electronics were the main drivers of a
decrease in its Composite Materials market fields’ sales to third parties by CHF18 million, or 20.2%,
year-on-year in 2020, and declines in PMDA also contributed to a decrease in sales of the PIC market field
of CHF26 million, or 6.1%, year-on-year in 2020.

At the same time, primarily driven by reduced activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our total
operational expenditure as a percentage of sales to third parties decreased from 20.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 (with particular decreases in
marketing and distribution costs, as well as administration costs and general overheads, driven by lower
spend on travel, consulting services, trade shows and conferences). See also ‘‘Risk Factors—The outbreak of
_Covid-19 has had and may continue to have a negative impact on the sales and operations of some of our_
_market fields.’’ On the other hand, we incurred CHF2.3 million of direct costs, such as purchasing masks_
and performing temperature checks. We received governmental support, mainly in China, with a value of
CHF1.4 million.

**_Corporate cost allocations_**

Administration and general overheads reported on our income statements for the years under review
include corporate administration costs, royalty fees and environmental remediation costs from Lonza
Group, which were allocated to us in accordance with carve-out accounting principles and represent a
proportionate amount of such costs and fees that were historically recorded at the Lonza Group level
without being recharged to the LSI Business. These costs and fees amounted to CHF43 million,
CHF42 million and CHF18 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
We do not consider these costs and fees to be entirely representative of our additional standalone
corporate costs going forward as we transition to operating as a standalone business. These corporate cost
allocations do not reflect our expected cost structure under our target operating model, the expected
rebranding of our business, the expected replacement of the Lonza Group LTIP with a new management
incentive program and the allocation of environmental remediation costs at our Visp site to Lonza Group
pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

In addition, these corporate cost allocations do not fully reflect our contractual relationships with Lonza
Group, such as the Supply and Tolling Agreements. For a certain period of time, pursuant to the Sale and
Purchase Agreement, Lonza Group has agreed to take certain actions to facilitate our ability to operate on
a standalone basis, including, subject to certain exceptions, the provision of a number of services pursuant
to the Global Services Agreement, Site Services Agreements, Supply and Tolling Agreements, including in
relation to general administration and business services, customs support, IT, procurement, real estate,
human resources, compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions), logistics and warehousing and others. See
‘‘Business—Material Agreements—Post-Acquisition Arrangements with Lonza.’’ As we transition to operating
as a standalone business, we expect to internally develop or externally source replacements for these
systems and services. We expect that the development of such systems and services will require additional
investment, as well as related administrative and implementation work and separate operational
technology licenses.

**_Operational improvement measures_**

We operate in an industry where efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial in order to maintain
or improve competitiveness and profitability. In the years under review, our operational improvement
measures focused broadly on the following key areas: (i) optimizing our cost of goods sold by reducing
fixed costs, pursuing alternative chemical formulations, removing bottlenecks in our manufacturing
processes and reducing variable costs; (ii) improving operational excellence at four key manufacturing
sites; (iii) integrating our global supply chain; (iv) increasing automation and digitalization to enable
efficiency at our Visp site; and (v) improving operational leverage and economies of scale in our Microbial
Control Solutions business. We have incurred certain restructuring costs in connection with our
operational improvement measures, amounting to CHF5 million, CHF22 million and CHF6 million for the
years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

**_Currency fluctuations_**

We are exposed to translation and transactional foreign exchange risks. Due to the broad scope of our
international operations, a substantial portion of our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses are denominated
in currencies other than the Swiss franc. Our predominant exposures are the U.S. dollar and the euro.
Further main foreign exchange exposures relate to British pounds sterling and Chinese yuan. Changes in
the exchange rates between these currencies can affect our operations and financial position as a result of
translational exchange rate effects. These effects arise because the financial results of our subsidiaries are
measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (our
functional currency). The results of operations and assets and liabilities of a number of our global
subsidiaries are, therefore, measured in currencies other than the Swiss franc and are then translated into
Swiss francs for presentation of our financial results, assets and liabilities in our Financial Statements.
Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates may increase or decrease the
Swiss franc value of our non-Swiss franc assets, liabilities, sales, costs and order intake, even if their value
has not changed in the local functional currency.

Exchange rate fluctuations have had a significant impact on our reported sales to third parties in the past.
For example, in the year ended December 31, 2020 our reported sales to third parties of CHF1,655 million
were significantly lower than our sales to third parties on a currency-adjusted basis of CHF1,750 million,
which was attributable in large part to a depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc.

We are also exposed to transactional risk to the extent our subsidiaries and we execute transactions in a
currency other than their functional currency, which arises mainly when we import components from one
jurisdiction, incurring a cost in that jurisdiction’s currency, and invoice for our products and installation in
the local currency.

The exchange rates between the functional currencies of our global subsidiaries and the Swiss franc have
fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. We apply a natural hedging
strategy, which aims to proportionally match revenues and costs for each currency we use. For certain
currencies, a natural hedging strategy is not commercially feasible. In such cases, we aim to hedge our
exposure. Through their impact on sales and costs, foreign exchange movements may impact our reported
profitability. For additional information on how currency fluctuations affect our results of operations, see
_‘‘—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management—Market Risk.’’_

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_Changes to accounting standards—IFRS 16 (Leases)_**

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), which replaced IAS 17 and the related IFRIC
and SIC interpretations and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the
distinction between operating and finance leases was eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee
recognizes an asset (the right-to-use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The
only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases should a company elect to apply an available practical
expedient in order to reduce the transition effort. IFRS 16 became effective for fiscal years commencing
on or after January 1, 2019.

The LSI Business adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on January 1, 2019, by opting to apply the modified
retrospective method, which means that the cumulative transition effects of initial applications are
recognized in retained earnings as at January 1, 2019. The LSI Business elected to use the transition
practical expedient allowing the standard to be applied only to contracts that were previously identified as

101


-----

leases applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 as at the date of initial application. Accordingly, no adjusted
comparative information was disclosed.

The transition to IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As a result,
figures as at and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 may not be comparable to the results
presented for prior periods. As at January 1, 2019, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, our
right-of-use assets (presented in property, plant and equipment) amounted to CHF18 million,
CHF15 million and CHF14 million, respectively, and lease liabilities (presented in other non-current
liabilities and other current liabilities) amounted to CHF18 million, CHF15 million and CHF14 million,
respectively. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020,
amounted to CHF5 million and CHF4 million, respectively, and the interest expenses from lease liabilities
amounted to CHF1 million and CHF1 million, respectively. The adoption of IFRS 16 had a positive impact
on our Adjusted EBITDA, as the cost of operating leases that were previously expensed above Adjusted
EBITDA are now moved below Adjusted EBITDA and included in depreciation of right-of-use assets and
interest expense. See Note 1 ‘‘Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation’’ to the 2020 Financial
Statements.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Future Results of Operations**

We believe that the factors described below will have a significant effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow in the future. These factors are forward-looking statements and are
subject to various assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those
expected or implied by the statements set forth below. See ‘‘Forward Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk
_Factors.’’_

**_The Transactions_**

After the completion of the Transactions, we expect to report our financial results and condition at the
level of the SUN Issuer. The Financial Statements in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to
reflect the impact of any changes that might occur as a result of purchase price allocation effects to be
applied as a result of the Transactions. However, we will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition
method in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘‘Business Combinations’’ and will apply purchase price allocation
effects in connection with the Transactions to our financial statements for accounting periods subsequent
to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying
values for existing assets and liabilities that we may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible
assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation
expenses. As a result of purchase accounting, the goodwill that is reflected on the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2020 will not exist following the Acquisition. Due to these and other potential adjustments,
our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not
be comparable to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

We will also incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions. As at December 31,
2020, on an unaudited basis to give _pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had_
CHF2,665 million of outstanding total financial indebtedness, comprising CHF318.0 million (U.S. Dollar
equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, CHF512.5 million
(Euro equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes offered hereby and CHF1,834 million in
aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities. In addition, as of
December 31, 2020 the LSI Business had lease liabilities of CHF14 million. See ‘‘Capitalization.’’

We also expect to incur significant one-off costs and to make substantial capital expenditures in connection
with our separation from Lonza Group. We estimate that we will incur one-off costs of approximately
CHF17 million until 2023 and to make capital expenditures of approximately CHF29 million until the end
of 2022 related to the separation from Lonza Group.

Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations may differ from the historical financial
condition and results of operations presented in this discussion as a result of the Transactions.

**_Transformation Program_**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Sponsors commissioned a third-party due diligence report from a
global consulting firm to analyze the financial condition and operations of the LSI Business and its
potential for achieving cost savings. This report identified up to CHF99 million in potential ‘‘run rate’’ cost

102


-----

savings within five years of the Acquisition Closing Date, based on the cost base pursuant to LSI’s target
operating model, that may be achievable through the implementation of various transformation measures
over a period of five years (not including potential revenue upside from certain pricing initiatives identified
in the report). This cost savings potential is also supported by other due diligence and detailed cost
assessments undertaken by the Sponsors in connection with the Acquisition as well as by benchmarking
LSI’s profitability against that of its public peer companies. It is also comparable to profitability
improvements achieved in other corporate carve-outs in the chemicals sector under sponsor ownership. In
addition, we expect to achieve cost savings of CHF2 million from the outset in relation to IT costs included
in the target operating model, largely related to the non-hiring of initially planned employee hires.

Following the completion of the Acquisition, we intend to initiate a transformation program to implement
these transformation measures (the ‘‘Transformation Program’’) and expect to realize cost savings of
CHF69 million within 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date and an additional CHF2 million from
IT cost savings described above, assuming, among other things, that the program will be implemented
beginning on the Acquisition Closing Date and driven by key management, although we believe that some
of these measures can be initiated even prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, because they are a
continuation of LSI’s existing and ongoing efficiency measures or involve not filling positions that were
initially contemplated by the target operating model for the LSI standalone business, or filling these
positions in lower cost locations than initially planned.

The Transformation Program focuses on cost savings opportunities related to: (i) manufacturing; (ii) raw
materials procurement; (iii) indirect spend control; (iv) sales and marketing costs; (v) G&A costs; and
(vi) R&D costs. We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to approximately CHF103 million between
2021 and 2023 in connection with these initiatives, comprising: (i) approximately CHF58 million in
expected one-off costs, including severance costs, IT costs and program delivery costs, including consulting,
financial and legal advisory fees in connection with implementing our Transformation Program; and
(ii) approximately CHF45 million in expected capital expenditures related to manufacturing savings. Our
estimates of cost savings opportunities are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the
information available to us and our management’s judgments based on such information, and reflect our
assumptions about the cost base of our target operating model. The assumptions used in estimating costs
savings are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in these estimates. We may not be able to realize these cost savings, either in the amount or within the
timeframe we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these cost savings may be higher than
expected. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may fail to achieve the
_targeted benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures.’’_

As part of manufacturing cost savings initiatives, we intend to streamline our manufacturing operations,
including implementing personnel optimization and organizational efficiency measures. These include
further automation and digitalization at our manufacturing sites, setting more ambitious productivity
targets and increasing productivity through higher utilization and workforce rationalization. We also intend
to implement efficiency measures, such as increases in the proportion of direct workforce, such as
operators, at our manufacturing sites compared to our indirect workforce, such as supervisors, engineers
and maintenance workers.

As part of raw materials cost savings initiatives, we intend to optimize our raw materials procurement. This
includes optimizing the balance of raw materials sourced directly versus through distributors, reviewing
supplier relationships and implementing sourcing efficiencies. In terms of basic chemicals (such as caustic
soda and ammonia), we intend to rebalance direct and distribution purchases to optimize pricing and
terms and conditions, including more favorable pricing for regionally sourced commodities. For specialty
chemicals (such as amines and glycerin), which are sourced from a small number of large suppliers, we
expect to focus on establishing long-term agreements, price indexing, bundling with non-oligopoly products
and volume incentives. For critical sole-sourced raw materials (such as pyridine), we expect to work
proactively with suppliers to establish flexible strategies. We also expect to generate cost savings by
optimizing procurement of certain specialty products and external production spend on finished goods for
resale and tollers.

As part of indirect spend cost savings initiatives, we intend to generate cost savings in logistics, repair,
maintenance, travel and telecommunication services. We expect to focus on centralizing management of
these costs, which are currently addressed at local level, to generate procurement synergies.

103


-----

As part of sales and marketing cost savings initiatives, we intend to reduce the existing complexity of the
sales and marketing function, such as substantial role duplication, generating expected cost savings from
personnel-related initiatives. The remaining cost savings are expected to be generated by non-personnel
related initiatives, such as cost supervision.

As part of G&A cost savings initiatives, we intend to implement a number of initiatives targeting our
general and administrative costs, primarily a leaner operating model that is more consistent with what we
understand to be the operating model of our peers. These initiatives include organizational simplification,
optimizations through attrition savings and non-hiring of new employees initially contemplated by our
target operating model, as well as organizational efficiency through increased automation, and retaining
higher-performing employees. We also intend to reduce the number of shared service centers we operate
from ten to three (with one in each of EIMEA, APAC and Americas), as well as to shift employees to
lower cost countries.

As part of R&D cost savings initiatives, we intend to implement various initiatives related to streamlining
our research and development operations.

As part of our Transformation Program, we also intend to implement various working capital optimization
initiatives. These include increased focus on quarter- and year-end collections, enhanced collections and
billing strategies, product line rationalizations, selling slow-moving or obsolete stock at a discount,
improving the accuracy of sales forecasting, and other related improvement initiatives focused on
optimizing our net working capital balance and smoothing working capital requirements. A third-party due
diligence report commissioned by the Sponsors in connection with the Acquisition has identified working
capital optimization potential that could lead to estimated higher balances of cash and cash equivalents of
up to CHF136 million within an 18 to 24-month period.

_Information—Pro forma Financial Metrics’’ and ‘‘—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Working Capital.’’_

**Key Line Items in Our Income Statement**

Set forth below is a description of the key line items presented in our Financial Statements and discussed
in this ‘‘Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ section.

**_Sales to third parties_**

Sales to third parties include revenue generated from contracts with third-party customers. Revenue from
sales of products to such third-party customers is recognized when they obtain control of the underlying
goods and thus have the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from such goods. Revenue from
sales of services is recognized in the accounting periods in which the underlying services are rendered.

**_Sales to related parties_**

Sales to related parties include revenue generated from contracts with Lonza Group. In the years under
review, these included other parts of Lonza Group’s business, including LPBN and, for the year ended
December 31, 2018, the Water Care business, which was disposed of by Lonza Group on February 28, 2019.
We apply the same approach to revenue recognition for our sales to related parties, as described in
‘‘—Sales to third parties’’ above.

**_Total sales_**

Total sales include sales to third parties and sales to related parties.

**_Cost of goods sold_**

Cost of goods sold includes the production and purchase costs incurred to generate our total sales. In
addition to direct cost of inventories, which represent the majority of our cost of goods sold, it also includes
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and changes in fair value hedges. Expenses for doubtful trade
receivables and a portion of expenses related to short-term leases and low value assets are also recognized
within the cost of goods sold.

**_Gross profit_**

Gross profit is total sales less cost of goods sold.

104


-----

**_Marketing and distribution_**

Marketing and distribution expenses primarily relate to costs incurred in respect of marketing, advertising,
promotional expenditure and subscriptions to associated trade bodies.

**_Research and development_**

Research and development expenses include expenses in connection with research and development
activities not eligible for capitalization and other costs related to the functional area of research and
development. We typically capitalize only a minor portion of our R&D expenses.

**_Administration and general overheads_**

Administration and general overheads expenses include corporate administration costs, such as indirect
wages and salaries with our employees, as well as indirect overheads, including insurances costs, legal and
professional fees and office supplies. Amortization of intangibles and a portion of expenses related to
short-term leases and low value assets are also included in administration and general overheads. Finally,
administration and general overheads include corporate administration costs, royalty fees and
environmental remediation costs allocated to us while we are operating as part of Lonza Group, including
costs allocated to us in respect of the Lonza Group LTIP, which is settled with Lonza shares and does not
involve cash payments.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income include items not assignable to other functions of the income statement. Other
operating income mainly include gains from the disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment and other non-current assets, income from the release and recognition of provisions, income
related to restructuring, gains from currency-related operating derivative instruments, as well as operating
exchange rate gains.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses include items not assignable to other functions of the income statement. Other
operating expenses mainly include losses from the disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment and other non-current assets, expenses from the release and recognition of provisions, expenses
related to restructuring, losses from currency-related operating derivative instruments, as well as operating
exchange rate losses.

**_Result from operating activities_**

Result from operating activities comprises total sales, less cost of goods sold, marketing and distribution
costs, research and development costs and administration and general overhead costs, plus other operating
income less other operating expenses.

**_Financial income_**

Financial income consists of interest income from financial receivables, income from valuation of interest
derivatives, other interest and similar income. It includes loan interest, foreign exchange rate effects from
loans and interest on bank accounts.

**_Financial expenses_**

Financial expenses consist of net interest on the net defined benefit liability, interest expenses on financial
debt, interest costs included in lease payments and other interest and similar expenses. Interest expenses
primarily comprise interest on external debt, interest on related party loans with Lonza Group, interest on
employee benefit liabilities and interest on our factoring program, as well as on an accounts receivable
securitization program that was discontinued in 2020.

**_Share of (loss)/profit of associates_**

Share of (loss)/profit of associates represents the share of net results of associated undertakings.

105


-----

**_Profit before income taxes_**

Profit before income taxes is the net sum of result from operating activities, net financial result and share
of (loss)/profit of associates.

**_Income taxes_**

Income taxes for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is calculated on the basis of the
tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries in which we operate
and generate taxable income. Deferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on temporary
differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our Financial
Statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. As we operate globally, we are
subject to income taxes in several different tax jurisdictions. From January 1, 2020, we have applied, as the
carve-out tax rate, the ordinary tax rate of 13% applicable in the Canton of Basel in Switzerland, the
location of Lonza Group’s headquarters. Before 2020, and prior to a tax reform implemented in
Switzerland, we applied the ordinary tax rate of our operating entity in the Canton of Valois in Switzerland
of 21.6% as the carve-out tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 20.9% in the year ended December 31, 2018,
26.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019 and 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Profit for the period_**

Profit for the period is the sum of profit before income taxes and income taxes.

**_Sales to third parties_**

Our sales to third parties decreased by CHF36 million, or 2.1%, to CHF1,655 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF1,691 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by
adverse impact of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc. On a currency-adjusted basis,
our sales to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2020 were CHF1,750 million, representing a
CHF59 million, or 3.5%, increase from our sales to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Microbial Control Solutions_

Sales to third parties of our Microbial Control Solutions business unit increased by CHF38 million, or
3.7%, to CHF1,068 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF1,030 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties increased by 11.1% to
CHF1,144 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Hygiene_

Sales to third parties in the Hygiene market field increased by CHF95 million, or 55.9%, to
CHF265 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF170 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to a structural shift in the market related to significantly increased
demand driven by Covid-19. The sales growth was partially offset by the appreciation of the Swiss franc
compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties
increased by 65.9% to CHF282 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Home and Personal Care_

Sales to third parties in the Home and Personal Care market field increased by CHF4 million, or 1.7%, to
CHF238 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF234 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to strong demand in laundry/HC Preservation and new business in
laundry. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties increased by 9.4% to CHF256 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020.

_Wood Protection_

Sales to third parties in the Wood Protection market field decreased by CHF3 million, or 0.9%, to
CHF313 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF316 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. On a
currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties increased by 5.7% to CHF334 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Lower demand during COVID-19 lockdown in the first half of 2020 was offset by
higher sales to third parties in the second half of 2020, particularly in do-it-yourself markets in Americas
and EIMEA. Additionally, supply issues at one of our competitors in the second half of 2020 allowed us to
win additional business at the end of 2020.

_Paints and Coatings_

Sales to third parties in the Paints and Coatings market field decreased by CHF17 million, or 12.5%, to
CHF119 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF136 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower demand for a number of products as a result of Covid-19 (such
as a decrease in demand for marine antifouling paints in the shipping industry) and regulatory pressure
restricting the use of zinc pyrithione in Canada. On a currency-adjusted basis, the decrease in sales to third
parties was less pronounced, amounting to 5.9%, with sales to third parties of CHF128 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020.

_Material Protection_

Sales to third parties in the Material Protection market field decreased by CHF32 million, or 24.4%, to
CHF99 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF131 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to softer demand from the oil and gas industry as well as the automotive
sector. Softer demand in the oil and gas industry was mainly caused by the collapse of crude oil prices at
the end of the first quarter of 2020, whereas softer demand from the automotive sector was primarily due
to a slow-down in the sector caused by COVID-19. On a currency-adjusted basis, the decrease in sales to
third parties was less pronounced, amounting to 19.1%, with sales to third parties of CHF106 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Crop Protection_

Sales to third parties in the Crop Protection market field decreased by CHF8 million, or 18.6%, to
CHF35 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF43 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower demand in Agro Specialties due to unfavorable weather
conditions, regulatory challenges and reduced availability of quats (antimicrobial actives), as quats
production capacity was mainly allocated to Hygiene products. On a currency-adjusted basis, the decrease
in sales to third parties was less pronounced, amounting to 11.6%, with sales to third parties of
CHF38 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Specialty Chemical Services_

Sales to third parties of our Specialty Chemical Services business unit decreased by CHF74 million, or
11.2%, to CHF587 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF661 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties decreased by 8.3% to
CHF606 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_PIC_

Sales to third parties in the PIC market field decreased by CHF26 million, or 6.1%, to CHF403 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF429 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily
due to lower raw material prices for the key raw material PMDA, which were passed on to customers
under price formula—based contracts, the regular maintenance shutdown of the cracker in Visp, which
occurs every 2.5 years, and the exit from the Cyanuric Chloride business at the end of 2019. This was partly
offset by a positive trend in Vitamin B3 in 2020 due to higher price level driven by higher raw material
price of beta-picoline. On a currency-adjusted basis, the decrease in sales to third parties was less
pronounced, amounting to 2.8%, with sales to third parties of CHF417 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

108


-----

_Composite Materials_

Sales to third parties in the Composite Materials market field decreased by CHF18 million, or 20.2%, to
CHF71 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF89 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to softer demand from the aerospace and electronics market caused by
COVID-19, partly offset by stronger demand from the industrial market. On a currency-adjusted basis, the
decrease in sales to third parties was less pronounced, amounting to 16.9%, with sales to third parties of
CHF74 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_CDMO_

Sales to third parties in the CDMO market field decreased by CHF24 million, or 16.8%, to
CHF119 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF143 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to the loss of a large CDMO project in 2019 to a competitor from a
lower-cost country and ongoing rejuvenation of project pipeline with a number of projects phasing out or
ending and new projects only ramping up, which we expect to continue during 2021. Additionally, we
experienced delays in some CDMO campaigns which led to sales shifts into 2021. Foreign exchange rates
had little effect on sales to third parties in the CDMO market field, mainly because a large share of the
sales was denominated in Swiss francs. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties decreased by
16.1% to CHF120 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Sales to related parties_**

Our sales to related parties increased by CHF5 million, or 8.9%, to CHF61 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF56 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher
demand from Lonza Group for a number of products.

**_Total sales_**

Our total sales decreased by CHF31 million, or 1.8%, to CHF1,716 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF1,747 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons
discussed above.

**_Cost of Goods sold_**

Our cost of goods sold decreased by CHF39 million, or 3.2%, to CHF1,213 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF1,252 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the
decrease in sales, as well as cost management measures and favorable prices of certain raw materials.

**_Gross profit_**

Our gross profit increased by CHF8 million, or 1.6%, to CHF503 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 from CHF495 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons discussed above.

**_Marketing and distribution_**

Our marketing and distribution expenses decreased by CHF6 million, or 5.3%, to CHF107 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF113 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due
to cost savings measures, lower activity due to the Covid-19 pandemic and favorable foreign exchange rate
impact.

**_Research and development_**

Our research and development expenses decreased by CHF13 million, or 27.1%, to CHF35 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF48 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due
to a hiring delay due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the full-year impact of restructuring measures
undertaken in 2019 and reduced costs for external experiments and expertise.

**_Administration and general overheads_**

Our administration and general overheads decreased by CHF23 million, or 12.2%, to CHF165 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF188 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily
due to lower allocations from Lonza Group corporate administration costs, royalty fees and environmental

remediation costs. These allocations amounted to CHF42 million and CHF18 million for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

**_Other operating income_**

Our other operating income increased by CHF3 million, or 16.7%, to CHF21 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to gains
from exchange rate fluctuations, disposal of property, plant and equipment and sundry income.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Our other operating expenses decreased by CHF1 million, or 3.7%, to CHF26 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF27 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to losses
from exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring expenses, impairment of assets and sundry expenses.

**_Result from operating activities_**

Our result from operating activities increased by CHF54 million, or 39.4%, to CHF191 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from CHF137 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons
discussed above.

**_Financial income_**

Our financial income increased by CHF6 million, or 120%, to CHF11 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased
income from related party loans with Lonza Group.

**_Financial expenses_**

Our financial expenses increased by CHF24 million, or 57.1%, to CHF66 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF42 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased
interest on related party loans with Lonza Group.

**_Net financial result_**

Our net financial result increased by CHF18 million, or 48.6%, to CHF55 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF37 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons discussed
above.

**_Share of (loss)/profit of associates_**

Our share of (loss)/profit of associates increased by CHF3 million, or 300%, to CHF4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from a loss of CHF1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily
due to three equity investments into early stage companies.

**_Profit before income taxes_**

Our profit before income taxes increased by CHF33 million, or 33.3%, to CHF132 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from CHF99 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons
discussed above.

**_Income taxes_**

Our income taxes increased by CHF8 million, or 30.8%, to CHF34 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF26 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an
increase in current taxes by CHF17 million, which was partially offset by deferred tax income of
CHF6 million resulting from tax rate changes. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020
was 25.8%, compared to 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**_Profit for the period_**

Our profit for the period increased by CHF25 million, or 34.2%, to CHF98 million for the year ended

See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—IFRS 16 (Leases).’’

**_Sales to third parties_**

Our sales to third parties decreased by CHF57 million, or 3.3%, to CHF1,691 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from CHF1,748 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales to third parties
were adversely affected by foreign currency exchange movements. On a currency-adjusted basis, our sales
to third parties were CHF1,705 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a
CHF43 million, or 2.5%, decrease from our sales to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The development of Sales to third parties in our Microbial Control Solutions business unit was driven by
an increasingly competitive environment in wood protection products offered by the business unit’s Wood
Protection market field and weaker demand in the business unit’s Home and Personal Care market field,
offset by strong growth in sales of products offered by the business unit’s Hygiene market field. Sales to
third parties in Specialty Chemical Services was driven by CDMO sales decline, competitive pressures due
to the ongoing consolidation in the agrochemicals industry and a more rigid regulatory environment
resulting in less actives and increasing cost focus, which was partially offset by increased sales of
fermentation products and due to decreases in global prices of vitamin B3 due to African swine fever and
reduced composite volumes in electronics due to competitive pressure.

Sales to third parties in the Hygiene market field increased by CHF9 million, or 5.6%, to CHF170 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF161 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to a combination of favorable regulatory changes introduced in North America that enabled
us to gain new customers, a high level of negotiation power with regards to certain registered products and
an increase in customer demand. LSI typically benefits from the regulatory environment in North America,
where we offer the customers regulatory support and sale of products through sub-registration contracts.

On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties increased by 6.2%, to CHF171 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

CHF234 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF245 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to supply chain disruptions, caused by a factory fire at a supplier in the
U.S. and increased price competition in the food business, as well as changes in customer sentiment
affecting two key customers.

to market consolidation, as a result of which we initially lost some market share and were able to regain
customers only by reducing prices.

On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties decreased by 0.6%, to CHF318 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

_Paints and Coatings_

CHF136 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF126 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to a supply chain disruption resulting from an explosion at Xiangshui
Chemical Park in China, which resulted in the shutdown of several suppliers, caused a supply shortage in
the market and allowed us to increase prices and generate higher sales to third parties, despite lower sales
volumes, in certain products.

On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties increased by 9.5%, to CHF138 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

_Material Protection_

CHF131 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF129 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to favorable market conditions of customers in the oil and gas business
in the Americas, partly offset by a negative impact of the US-China trade conflict.

On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties increased by 1.6%, to CHF131 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

_Crop Protection_

competition from China.

On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties decreased by 21.4%, to CHF44 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

_Specialty Chemical Services_

Sales to third parties of our Specialty Chemical Services business unit decreased by CHF53 million, or
7.4%, to CHF661 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF714 million for the year ended

for the year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF485 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to lower raw material prices, which were passed on to customers as a result of formula—
based pricing under customer agreements and discontinuation of the fertilizer business.

On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to third parties decreased by 10.9%, to CHF432 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

_Composite Materials_

Sales to third parties in the Composite Materials market field decreased by CHF5 million, or 5.3%, to
CHF89 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF94 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to price decreases for two main product categories. We experienced a
high level of demand for diethyl toluenediamine in 2018 as one of our competitors experienced issues with
supplying its customers. In 2019, the competitor resolved the supply issues and tried gain back market
share by reducing prices. We also lowered prices in order not to lose volumes. Additionally, we also
experienced a decline in demand for Primaset from industrial sectors.

Our marketing and distribution expenses decreased by CHF12 million, or 9.6%, to CHF113 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF125 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due
to a decrease in expenses for our STIP as a result of the business performance and implementation of
organizational efficiency measures at the end of the first half of 2019.

**_Research and development_**

Our research and development expenses decreased by CHF2 million, or 4.0%, to CHF48 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF50 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due
to restructuring measures put in place during 2019.

Our administration and general overheads decreased by CHF4 million, or 2.1%, to CHF188 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF192 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due
to lower costs allocated from the Lonza Group, royalty fees, environmental remediation costs and lower
short-term incentive payments for LSI employees due to underperformance of the LSI Business compared

December 31, 2019 from CHF19 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a
decrease in gain from foreign exchange rate differences, partially offset by an increase in sundry income
related to year-end accruals.

114


-----

**_Other operating expenses_**

Our other operating expenses decreased by CHF6 million, or 18.2%, to CHF27 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from CHF33 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a
decrease in loss from foreign exchange rate differences of CHF12 million, partially offset by an increase in
sundry expenses of CHF13 million related to impairment charges and year-end cut-off accruals.

**_Result from operating activities_**

Our result from operating activities decreased by CHF4 million, or 2.8%, to CHF137 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from CHF141 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons
discussed above.

**_Financial income_**

Our financial income increased by CHF1 million, or 25.0%, to CHF5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from CHF4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher
interest income from related party loans and advances to Lonza Group.

**_Financial expenses_**

Our financial expenses decreased by CHF5 million, or 10.6%, to CHF42 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from CHF47 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower
interest expense on related party loans from Lonza Group.

**_Net financial result_**

Our net financial result increased by CHF6 million, or 14.0%, to a loss of CHF37 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from a loss of CHF43 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the

Our income taxes increased by CHF6 million, or 30.0%, to CHF26 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from CHF20 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an
increase in current taxes by CHF4 million, partially offset by a deferred tax income deduction resulting
from tax rate changes of CHF3 million that was not applicable in the year ended December 31, 2018. Our
effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 26.1%, compared to 20.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2018, due primarily to changes in the profitability of different legal entities, as well as higher
non-deductible expenses and lower tax-free earnings.

Our profit for the period decreased by CHF6 million, or 7.6%, to CHF73 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from CHF79 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons discussed

**Liquidity and Capital resources**

**_Overview_**

Following the completion of the Transactions, we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be cash
flows from operations and drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The availability of our Revolving
Credit Facility will be subject to certain conditions.

115


-----

We aim to manage capital to ensure that we can continue to operate as a going concern. Our ability to
generate cash flow from operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn
dependent on general economic, financial, competitive, market and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control. In addition, we anticipate that we will be highly leveraged in the foreseeable future
and our ability to generate future financing cash flows will be limited by the Indentures and the Senior
Facilities, which may have important negative consequences for you. See ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ Any_
additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make
payments on our then existing indebtedness, including the Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.

The proceeds from the Offering will be used as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**_Cash Flows_**

The table below sets out the principal components of our cash flows for the years indicated:

**For the year ended**
**December 31,**
**2018** **2019** **2020**
**(CHF million)**

**Cash and cash equivalents at December 31 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **159** **205** **124**

_Net cash provided by operating activities_

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by CHF13 million, or 9.3%, to CHF153 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF140 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due
to higher cash generation from operations driven by our resilience and diversification in end markets and
geographies. Our increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also due to higher trade net
working capital requirements in 2020 driven primarily by higher trade payables, and favorable
developments in other net working capital as a result of higher short-term personnel liabilities for our
STIP and an increase in deferred income, which were partially offset by higher interest payments on
related party loans with Lonza Group.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by CHF49 million, or 53.8%, to CHF140 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from CHF91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due
to adverse movements in other net working capital and movements in other payables, driven by an increase
in other operating receivables and derivatives linked to higher VAT receivables, lower short-term incentive
accruals for our STIP due to underperformance compared to our targets, a reduction in deferred income
and a decrease in other accruals driven by unbilled payables, as well as lower income taxes and lower
interest paid on related party loans with Lonza Group.

_Net cash used for investing activities_

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by CHF4 million, or 4.6%, to CHF83 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from CHF87 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to
decreased capital expenditure driven by our efforts to limit expenditure and manage our liquidity during
the Covid-19 pandemic.

Net cash used for investing activities increased by CHF15 million, or 20.8%, to CHF87 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from CHF72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the
purchase of unconsolidated investments in early stage companies.

116


-----

_Net cash used for financing activities_

Net cash used for financing activities increased by CHF137 million, or 2,740%, to CHF142 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from CHF5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to
net movements in our intercompany loan positions with Lonza Group.

Net cash used for financing activities decreased by CHF54 million, or 91.5%, to CHF5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from CHF59 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due
repayments of third-party debt and related party loans to Lonza Group in 2018 that did not reoccur in
2019, apart from the refinancing of third-party debt with related party loans with Lonza Group in 2019.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures amounted to CHF98 million, CHF93 million and CHF88 million in the years
ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and primarily relate to projects that assure current
production levels, efficiency, cost improvements and health and safety and also increase capacity and sales.
A significant position of our capital expenditure each year relates to our Visp site (CHF36 million,
CHF46 million and CHF52 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively)
and included expansion of cyanates, piroctone olamine (POX) plant adaptation, HMBDA and PHMB
production transfers to Visp, N2O abatement and a new fermentation pilot line in Kouˇrim.

Our capital expenditures decreased by CHF5 million, or 5.4%, to CHF88 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from CHF93 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower
capital expenditures during the Covid-19 pandemic, as we managed our liquidity and cash position due to
the uncertainty and limited visibility during the early months of the pandemic.

Our capital expenditures decreased by CHF5 million, or 5.1%, to CHF93 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from CHF98 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower
capital expenditures at our Mapleton site after large capital expenditure projects were completed in the
year ended December 31, 2018.

Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to third parties were 5.6%, 5.5%, and 5.3% in the years
ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

The table below breaks out our capital expenditure into maintenance and growth capital expenditures
based on our estimated allocations to maintenance and growth projects in the periods under review:

**For the year ended**
**December 31,**
**2018** **2019** **2020**
**(CHF million)**
Maintenance expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 81 71 74
Growth capital expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 22 14

**Total capital expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **98** **93** **88**

Over the coming years we expect our growth capital expenditure to increase and to account for a higher
percentage of our total capital expenditure, mainly linked to capacity expansion projects for our Hygiene
market field. We expect that our annual capital expenditures will likely be significantly higher in the near
term as a result of the capital expenditures required to separate our business from Lonza Group and to
establish ourselves as a standalone business, to implement various measures under our Transformation
Program and to support our planned growth initiatives. We also expect a portion of this capital expenditure
to be funded by our customers, which comprise projects developed and funded jointly with a particular
client.

We expect to make capital expenditures in relation to the separation of our business from Lonza Group of
approximately CHF29 million over a two-year period, primarily related to the development of our IT
systems. We also expect to make capital expenditure in connection with our implementation of the
Transformation Program of approximately CHF45 million between 2021 and 2023 (see ‘‘—Key Factors
_Affecting Our Future Results of Operations—Transformation Program’’). We are also currently planning to_
increase our growth capital expenditures significantly over the next few years, primarily to invest in our
Hygiene market field. After the expected initial increase in capital expenditure, over the medium-term we
expect our total capital expenditures to return to normal levels of approximately CHF100 million per year.

**_Working Capital_**

We define trade net working capital as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables. Our working
capital follows sales development closely, with some efficiency gains and payment term improvements over
time. We define operating net working capital as trade net working capital plus other operating receivables
and derivatives less other operating payables and derivatives.

The table below sets out our operating net working capital for the years indicated:

**For the year ended**
**December 31,**
**2018** **2019** **2020**

Notes:

(1) Includes other operating receivables and derivatives and other operating payables and derivatives.

(2) The changes in other net working capital in the year ended December 31, 2019 were driven by: (i) an increase in other
operating receivables and derivatives linked to higher VAT receivables; (ii) lower short-term incentive accruals due to
underperformance compared to our targets; (iii) a reduction in deferred income; and (iv) a decrease in other accruals driven by
unbilled payables.

See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.’’

As part of our Transformation Program, we also intend to implement various working capital optimization
initiatives. These include increased focus on quarter- and year-end collections, enhanced collections and
billing strategies, product line rationalizations, selling slow-moving or obsolete stock at a discount,
improving the accuracy of sales forecasting, and other related improvement initiatives focused on
optimizing our net working capital balance and smoothing working capital requirements. A third-party due
diligence report commissioned by the Sponsors in connection with the Acquisition has identified working
capital optimization potential that could lead to estimated higher balances of cash and cash equivalents of
up to CHF136 million within an 18 to 24-month period.

**_Contractual Obligations_**

The table below summarizes the SUN Issuer’s material contractual obligations as at December 31, 2020,
after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on such date (subject to the assumptions set
forth in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’):

**As at December 31, 2020**

The LSI Business also had lease liabilities of CHF14 million as of December 31, 2020, of which
CHF4 million were due within one year and CHF10 million between one and five years.

**_Contingent Liabilities and Other Financial Commitments_**

We did not have any contingent liabilities or other financial commitments as at December 31, 2020.

**_Off-balance Sheet Arrangements_**

Apart from our factoring program with ING Bank, we did not have any off-balance sheet items as at
December 31, 2020. Our ING factoring program was originally entered into in 2013 by Lonza Group’s
centralized treasury department to sell a portfolio of certain trade receivables and remained in effect as of
December 31, 2020. See Note 7.1 to our 2020 Financial Statements.

Our factoring program includes a change of control provision as a result of which the program would be
terminated upon closing of the Acquisition. We are currently evaluating potential alternatives for the
program.

**_Pensions and Post-Retirement Benefits_**

We operate defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as other employee benefit plans
in various countries in which we operate, with our largest defined benefit plans in Switzerland, the UK and
the United States. We had CHF33 million in cash contributions to defined benefit pension plans in the
year ended December 31, 2020, of which CHF12 million related to our U.S. defined benefit plans. We have
historically made voluntary payments to fund our defined benefit plans in the United States but do not
anticipate further near-term contributions to these plans. We are in discussions with the plan trustee of our
defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom regarding a potential funding of the plan deficit in connection
with the Acquisition, but cannot currently foresee the outcome of these discussions. Should we fund a
portion of the deficit in connection with the Acquisition, this would reduce our future annual contribution
obligations accordingly.

Our defined-benefit pension plans are reported as follows on the balance sheet as at the dates indicated:

**As at December 31,**
**2018** **2019** **2020**
**(CHF million)**
Defined benefit pension plan asset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 8 5
Defined benefit pension plan liability . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (169) (144) (167)

For additional details of our pensions and post-retirement benefits, see ‘‘Business—Employees’’ and
Note 19 of our 2020 Financial Statements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management**

We are exposed to financial risks, in particular in the form of credit and liquidity risk as well as to market
risks from movements in foreign currency exchange rates and market prices that affect its assets, liabilities,
and forecasted transactions. These risks have historically been managed at the Lonza Group level and our
overall risk management policy aims to limit these risks through operational and finance activities.

The analyses and amounts discussed below that are determined by means of sensitivity analyses represent
hypothetical, future-oriented data that can differ from actual outcomes because of unforeseeable
developments in financial markets. Moreover, non-financial or non-quantifiable risks, such as business
risks, are not considered here. Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk are described below and in more
detail in Note 22 of our 2020 Financial Statements.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk (default risk) is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and mainly arises from our receivables from customers.

Our exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each of our customers.
We assess the credit quality of our customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience
and other factors. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit
characteristics, including geographic location, industry, and existence of previous financial difficulties.

Purchase limits are established for each customer, which are reviewed regularly. For customers domiciled
in specific countries with high risk, we have credit risk insurance covering the maximum exposure. The
maximum credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the respective assets. There are no commitments
that could increase this exposure to more than the carrying amounts. In general, we do not require
collateral in respect of trade and other receivables but use credit insurance for country risk where
appropriate.

We have a history of low credit losses on accounts receivable. Credit losses that occurred in the past were
primarily related to very few customers. Furthermore, none of our operations had a heightened exposure
to credit losses in the past and based on our best estimate, this is not expected to change in the foreseeable
future.

Consequently, the allowance for credit losses represents primarily the credit risk of specific customers.

For more information on our credit risk, see Note 22.2 to our 2020 Financial Statements.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they fall due. Our
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that we will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to our reputation. We maintain flexibility in funding also using bilateral and syndicated
credit lines.

To counter this risk, cash inflows and outflows and due dates are continuously monitored and managed.
Cash requirements are primarily met by cash generated from operations and bilateral and syndicated
credit lines. As December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of CHF124 million, and we had cash
and cash equivalents of CHF159 million and CHF205 million as at December 31, 2018 and 2019,
respectively. As a result, there were no material concentrations of liquidity risk in the years under review.

We intend to continue to mitigate our liquidity risks by rolling liquidity planning and maintaining adequate
liquidity reserves in the form of cash. For more information on our liquidity risk, including future
undiscounted cash outflows, see Note 22.3 to our 2020 Financial Statements.

**_Market Risk_**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect our income or the value of our holdings of
financial instruments. We are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange and interest rates
and commodities. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return on risk.

_Foreign Exchange Risk_

We operate across the world and are exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting our financial
result and the value of our equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the amount of local currency paid
or received for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates
(‘‘transaction exposures’’) and because the foreign currency denominated financial statements of our
foreign subsidiaries may vary upon combination into the Swiss franc-denominated carve-out financial

120


-----

statements (‘‘translation exposures’’). In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, 57%, 61%
and 65%, respectively, of our total sales to third parties were generated by operating subsidiaries with a
functional currency other than the Swiss franc. Foreign exchange risks arise primarily on transactions that
are denominated in USD and EUR.

In managing our exposure regarding the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, Lonza Group has
entered into a variety of currency swaps and forward contracts on our behalf. These agreements generally
include the exchange of one currency against another currency at a future date. We adopt a policy of
considering hedging for all committed contractual exposure and the planned exposure is hedged within
certain ranges. Hedge ratios are determined by the risk committee and depend on market expectation, risk
bearing ability and risk appetite.

For more information on our foreign currency risk exposure, including a sensitivity analysis, see Note 22.4
to our 2020 Financial Statements.

_Interest Rate Risk_

Historically, our principal interest-bearing liabilities were comprised of the loans payable to the Lonza
Group and financial debt in the form of bank borrowings and lease liabilities. As most of these borrowings
bear variable interest rates that are based on inter-bank indices, we are exposed to interest rate risk.
Interest rate instruments can result in cash flow risks, opportunity effects, as well as interest rate risks
affecting the statement of financial position and earnings. Refinancing and variable-rate financial
instruments are subject to cash flow risk which expresses the uncertainty of future interest payments.

Borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities will be variable rate debt. We may consider entering into
certain derivative agreements, for hedging all or a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the interest
rate of these liabilities. We have not yet completed our analysis and procedures to determine the
accounting treatment of such potential derivative agreements.

For more information on our interest rate risk exposure, including a sensitivity analysis, see Note 22.4 to
our 2020 Financial Statements.

_Commodity Price Risk_

We require LPG and LVN as raw materials for our cracker in Visp. Butane, naphtha or propane can be
used as feedstock for the cracker. The raw material ultimately used depends on its availability and
specifications. The annual demand is approximately 100,000 metric tons. In order to minimize the risk of
higher raw material prices, we hedge part of the commodity price risk via swaps.

For more information on our commodity price risk exposure, including a sensitivity analysis, see Note 22.4
to our 2020 Financial Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The financial information presented in our Financial Statements does not necessarily reflect the net assets,
financial position, results of operations and capital structure that would have occurred if we had existed as
a separate, standalone group in the reporting periods under consideration. The fact that we did not
historically exist therefore limits the validity of such financial information. It also means that the Financial
Statements cannot be used to forecast the future development of our operations that have been carved-out
in our formation.

In preparing the Financial Statements, our management made additional assumptions and estimates,
particularly in connection with operating activities to be transferred and allocable expenses for
administrative services provided by remaining Lonza Group companies. These assumptions and estimates
affect the amounts and the reporting of recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and
contingent liabilities. The actual amounts may vary from these estimates.

The significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to the 2020 Financial Statements (including
(i) scope and principles of combination, (ii) investments, (iii) intercompany transactions and transactions
with related parties, (iv) revenue recognition, (v) other operating income and other operating expenses,
(vi) net financial result, (vii) foreign currencies, (viii) hedge accounting, (ix) property, plant and
equipment, (x) leases, (xi) intangible assets, (xii) goodwill, (xiii) inventories, (xiv) receivables, (xv) financial
instruments, (xvi) cash and cash equivalents, (xvii) impairment, (xviii) deferred taxes, (xix) employee
benefits, (xx) defined benefit plans, (xxi) provisions, and (xxii) share based compensation).

121


-----

The key assumptions about the future key sources of estimation uncertainty that entail a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of our assets and liabilities relate to (i) impairment
testing of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, (ii) pensions, (iii) income taxes,
(iv) environmental provisions and (v) carve-out adjustments, each as described in Note 1 to the 2020
Financial Statements.

In addition, our management has made the following judgments that have the most significant effect on
the amounts recognized in the Financial Statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are
disclosed above):

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We have recognized revenues for sales of goods to customers who have the right to rescind the sale if the
goods do not meet the agreed quality. We believe that, based on past experience with similar transactions,
the quality delivered will be accepted. Therefore, it is appropriate to recognize revenue on these
transactions during the respective period. Revenues are recognized only when, according to management’s
judgment, performance obligations are satisfied, control over the assets have been transferred to the
customer and no future performance obligation exists. For certain transactions, recognition of revenues is
based on the performance of the conditions agreed in particular contracts, the verification of which
requires evaluation and judgments by management.

**_Intangible Assets_**

We consider the trademarks acquired in 2011 through the Arch Chemicals business combination to have
an indefinite useful life, as they are well established in our respective markets and have a history of strong
performance. We intend and have the ability to maintain these trademarks for the foreseeable future. The
assumption of an indefinite useful life is reassessed whenever there is an indication that a trademark may
have a definite useful life. In addition, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for
impairment on an annual basis.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the IASB or other stand setting bodies
that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Except for the adoption of IFRS 16 (see
‘‘—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Changes to accounting standards—IFRS 16
_(Leases)’’), we believe that the adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our_
Financial Statements. Please refer to our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum for additional information on recently issued accounting standards and our plans for
adoption of those standards.

We are a leading global provider of microbial control solutions across various consumer and industrial
markets. We also offer specialty chemical products and services covering composites and specialty
chemicals. Our Microbial Control Solutions business unit is a market-leading trusted and innovative
supplier of microbial control solutions and chemical technologies used in a wide range of industrial and
consumer products to control harmful organisms, including viruses and bacteria. Its product development
and application support is focused on six attractive addressable markets with significant growth potential,
including hygiene, home and personal care, wood protection, paints and coatings, material protection and
crop protection. Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit offers solutions for composite materials
and resin components and resin systems processing additives used in technically demanding industries,
such as electronics and transportation. It also comprises custom development and manufacturing and
provides key performance intermediates and chemicals for many industrial applications.

**Microbial Control Solutions**

Microbial control solutions are used to prevent the development of harmful microorganisms and protect
human health and materials, and are mainly used as disinfectants or preservatives, among other
applications. End markets include Hygiene, Home and Personal Care, Wood Protection, Paints &
Coatings, Material Protection and Crop Protection. Each end market is subject to different underlying
growth drivers and exhibits different growth trajectories. The addressable market (excluding Crop
Protection) is expected to grow at a 4.3% compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) between 2019 and
2025. In 2020, the Hygiene market benefitted from Covid-19 related tailwinds, as the need for disinfection
products and awareness of their importance spread. Going forward, this greater shift towards the
application of biocides is likely to persist, supporting further market growth. The overall market is driven
by structural megatrends such as the growing global population and, in particular, middle class,
urbanization and rising living standards. Other trends include changing lifestyle and increasing focus on the
environment and sustainability and safeguarding people’s wellbeing as well as regulation.

The European and North American disinfection markets are mature and highly regulated. In Europe, the
market is governed by Regulation (EU) 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
May 22, 2012 (as amended) concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products
(‘‘BPR’’), which sets out rules governing the approval of active substances in biocidal products, authorizing
the supply and use of biocidal products, and the supply of articles, treated with biocidal products. In the
US, the main regulatory body is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (‘‘EPA’’).

Registrations of anti-microbial formulations is a lengthy and costly process, requiring significant regulatory
and application expertise as well as product know-how. Over the last two decades regulations have become
increasingly strict, leading to approximately 70% to 80% of registered antimicrobials having been phased
out by the EU and a similar number having been phased out in the US (with some differences among
individual U.S. states), resulting in higher development and registration costs. At the same time, regulatory
pressure leads to greater innovation amongst incumbent producers, and as a result, drives the market
towards higher value formulation and higher-end actives. In APAC and the rest of the world, regulatory
frameworks are developing and maturing, with both markets still heavily relying on ultra-low-cost chlorinebased disinfectants.

Currently there is some degree of regulatory pressure on traditional biocides such as zinc pyrithione and
creosote. In general, regulation creates growth opportunities for our alternative biocides.

**_Hygiene_**

_Industry Overview_

The hygiene market was estimated to have grown substantially in 2020, driven by increased demand as a
result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Long-term growth is expected to benefit from evolving regulatory
standard, new consumer habits and greater hygiene awareness, developed over the course of the pandemic.
The two main application areas of disinfection are professional and home care disinfection. The regional
split of the professional disinfection was 35% North America, 24% Europe, 32% APAC and 9% rest of the
world (as of 2020). The regional split of the home care disinfection market was 42% North America, 25%
Europe, 25% APAC and 8% rest of the world (as of 2020).

Our key competitors in active ingredients include Stepan, IFF, Solvay and Nouryon.

_Underlying Market Trends_

Within the Hygiene market, demand for microbial control solutions is primarily driven by demand for
disinfecting products. Between 2015 and 2019, the addressable market grew at a CAGR of approximately
7%, due to increasing awareness and stricter hygiene protocols. In 2020, the Hygiene market experienced
substantial growth of approximately 80%, driven by even higher compliance protocols and panic induced
buying of disinfectants as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The fundamental trends are expected to
continue after the Covid-19 pandemic is considered under control, but with varying resilience of the curve
depending on the end-market. As a result of a greater emphasis on hygiene, a shift in consumer behavior,
and evolving regulatory standards, long-term demand is expected to remain well above the 2019 levels.
Overall, the addressable market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.1% between 2019 and
2025.

The European and North American disinfection markets are mature and highly regulated. While
regulation was temporarily relaxed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is expected to further
tighten post-pandemic.

**_Home and Personal Care_**

_Industry Overview_

Biocides play a crucial role in home and personal care (‘‘H&PC’’) products to prevent spoiling, and they
are the main active ingredient in anti-dandruff products. The H&PC market is expected to grow at a
CAGR of approximately 2.4% between 2019 and 2025.

The H&PC market can be divided into three sub-segments: hair care, personal care preservation and home
care preservation. The regional split of the hair care sub-segment was 24% North America, 22% Europe,
38% APAC and 16% rest of the world (as of 2020). The regional split for the personal care preservation
sub-segment was 25% North America, 24% Europe, 34% APAC and 17% rest of the world (as of 2020).

124


-----

The regional split of the home care preservation sub-segment was 33% North America, 25% Europe, 30%
APAC and 12% rest of the world (as of 2020). All sub-segments have significant regional exposure to
APAC, benefitting from increasing demand from rising disposable incomes and population growth.

Our key competitors in active ingredients include Clariant, IFF and Ashland.

_Underlying Market Trends_

Rising disposable income levels, a greater emphasis on personal grooming and a greater focus on personal
health and wellness are the key drivers of growth in the market.

There are several factors affecting future penetration of biocides in H&PC markets, including increasing
consumer sensitivity, increasing attractiveness of ‘‘chemical-free’’ products, growth of natural preservatives,
biocide reduction through boosters and growing usage of solidified and concentrated products.

In personal care and home care, the desire of consumer goods companies to appeal to customer’s
eco-friendly demands, is shifting the balance away from traditional biocides. This is particularly the case
for ‘‘indie’’ brands and start-ups, though these represent less than 5% of the market. However, biocides
remain critical to their applications, and market penetration of these natural preservatives is modest due to
their inadequate efficacy and significantly higher cost. Biocides represent a limited share of the overall cost
of end products. Limited potential cost savings from reducing concentrations or replacing active
ingredients, reduces the incentive for companies to make a change away from traditional biocides, due to
the potentially severe reputational impact from a mistake in new chemical formulations. However, there is
strong pressure to reduce concentration levels through blends and boosters. In North America and
Europe, due to increasing demand for concentrated products with lower water content, there is less
breeding space for microbes and a reduced need for biocidal active ingredients.

The H&PC market is highly regulated, due to the potential impact on consumers and the environment.
Europe is the most heavily regulated region, followed by North America and APAC.

**_Wood Protection_**

_Industry Overview_

In the wood protection (‘‘WP’’) market, biocides are used to protect and enhance wood with innovative
technologies to improve its useful life and expand its applications. The underlying market is expected to
grow at a 3.5% CAGR between 2019 and 2025, primarily driven by global construction demand. The WP
market is split into residential treatment (approximately 60%) and industrial treatment (approximately
40%). On a regional level, the US is the largest market as a result of the high level of wood usage and high
level of biocide penetration.

Our key competitors include Koppers, Wolman, Rutgers, Viance and Obermeier. Our strong customer
relationships are a key success factor in this industry.

_Underlying Market Trends_

Wood is a climate neutral and sustainable construction material. The increasing use of wood as a
construction material and greater use of wood in buildings (such as decks), are the key drivers of growth in
residential treatment. In the industrial treatment, demand is primarily driven by growth in utility poles and
railway lines.

Biocide penetration is expected to remain stable, with limited threats of substitution. The increasing need
to protect wood in contact with mud and other exposed environmental conditions drives penetration in
residential treatment. However, the acceptance of wood alternatives (such as utility poles made of
concrete, steel or composites) is reducing overall demand growth in industrial treatment. Additionally,
alternative technologies, such as thermally modified (i.e. heat treated to prevent fungal decay),
furfurylation modified (i.e. wood density increased by impregnation with furfuryl alcohol to reduce
moisture levels) and acetylation modified (i.e. chemically modified wood by the acetylation process, no
longer presenting an attractive food source for fungi) wood, present alternatives to biocides. These are,
however, niche alternatives, which generally remain too expensive for commercial application.

The market is highly regulated, with each region characterized by its own set of regulations. One product
in particular, which is facing a high degree of regulatory pressure globally is creosote, a tar-based
preservative whose oil borne system improves wood’s resilience. Creosote is under review in Europe

125


-----

because it meets the BPR’s exclusion criteria, due to its classification as a category 1B carcinogen and it
may be banned in Europe. A final decision is expected within a matter of weeks on whether or not it will be
phased out, or its permitted usage will be extended by three to five years. A substitute for creosote by other
biocides represents a significant growth opportunity for us and other incumbent players. There are no
potential bans expected in North America or APAC, where it is currently widely used due to the lack of
alternatives. We do not produce creosote-related products, so we do not expect a ban on creosotes to harm
us or that any replacement would cannibalize our existing sales.

**_Paints & Coatings_**

_Industry Overview_

In the paints and coatings (‘‘P&C’’) market, biocides are responsible for the prevention of microbial
spoilage. The market is expected to grow at a 4.5% CAGR between 2019 and 2025, driven by underlying
growth in the automotive, construction and general industries, with a focus on developing regions such as
India, China and South East Asia.

The addressable market is split between dry in-can, dry-film and marine antifouling applications. Examples
of in-can applications include traditional architectural paints and coatings, whereas dry film relates to
coating on a cured surface, for example, in industrial and infrastructure applications. Marine anti-fouling
coatings are used to prevent attachment of organisms to ship hulls, which can otherwise increase fuel
consumption by up to 7% to 10%.

On a regional basis, the addressable market is evenly distributed across North America, Europe and APAC
for both in-can and dry-film applications. However, approximately 74% of the antifouling market is based
in APAC, due to the large size of the shipping industry in this region.

Our key competitors include Thor, Troy, Lanxess and IFF. The market is commoditized, resulting in some
pricing pressures, with differentiation and value being created by matrix formulation innovations, such as
boosters that allow reduced biocide content or other improved properties such longer use time, as well as
the level of services offered.

_Underlying Market Trends_

In-can applications experienced strong demand growth, with demand from architectural paints growing
approximately 3% in 2020. In particular, there has been an increase in do-it-yourself demand as consumers
have renovated their homes during Covid-19 related lockdowns and this trend is expected to continue into
2021. The underlying market is expected to grow at approximately 4% between 2021 and 2025. Within
dry-film and marine antifouling applications, the underlying market growth is driven by stricter regulatory
requirements that demand increasingly complex products, which are less harmful, but still very effective.
The dry-film market remained flat in 2020, but is expected to grow approximately 4%, between 2020 and
2022. Marine anti-fouling has been impacted by a slowdown in global trade in 2020, however, this is
expected to pick-up with the underlying market growing approximately 1% to 2% going forward through
2022.

Overall, biocide penetration is expected to remain broadly stable, driven by a mixture of headwinds and
offsetting tailwinds. Structural growth drivers include the shift from solvent-based to water-based coatings
(driven by environmental concerns presented by volatile organic compounds) and the shift to
high-performance coatings in developing markets. The switch to water-based coatings is driving biocide
penetration, because water provides a breeding ground for microbes and, thus, an increase in water-based
coatings drives greater demand for biocides. This trend has particular headroom in APAC.
High-performance paints and coatings also require higher levels of biocides, and thus a greater use of these
paints drives biocide demand. These positive penetration trends are expected to continue over the next
three to five years. On the other hand, there is growing regulatory pressure to reduce the amount of
biocide use in paints, such as the recent phase out of methylisothiazolinone (‘‘MIT’’), (which we do not
produce) and increasing consumer demand for ‘‘green’’ labels, which guarantee more stringent biocide
thresholds, reducing market penetration. Furthermore, increasing use of boosters and functional additives
can reduce the need for high biocide concentrations.

The industry is highly regulated, with regulatory changes typically led by the EU, with the US and APAC
often following suit. The main regulatory bodies heavily restrict both the amount and usage of biocides
within paints and coatings, as well as active ingredients for use in formulated products. For in-can
applications, MIT is being phased out, particularly from DIY/consumer paints, because the EU now

126


-----

requires hazardous re-labelling for MIT due to its strong skin sensitizing properties. For dry film
applications, there will potentially be negative impacts from the reclassification of zinc pyrithione in March
2022, which may lead to unfavorable regulatory labelling. In marine anti-fouling, there are concerns over
the use of heavy metals such as zinc and copper. However, the introduction of a regulatory framework in
China will provide an opportunity for a significant degree a reformulation.

**_Material Protection_**

_Industry Overview_

In the material protection (‘‘MP’’) market, biocides are required to improve performance, aesthetics and
anti-corrosion properties of metals, plastics and other materials. The addressable market grew at a 5%
CAGR between 2015 and 2019. Going forward, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of
approximately 4.2%, between 2019 and 2025.

The majority of activity in the MP market takes place in Asia, accounting for approximately 40% of the
addressable market, followed by Europe and North America, accounting for approximately 25% each. The
key segments of the market are polymers and textiles (approximately 30%), oil and gas (approximately
25%), plastics (approximately 20%), metal working fluids (approximately 15%) and leather protection
(approximately 10%).

The market is fragmented in terms of competition, largely due to the diverse requirements across the
various applications. Our key competitors include Thor, Troy and Lanxess. There are significant entry
requirements, such as a high degree of formulation know-how.

_Underlying Market Trends_

The underlying market growth is primarily driven by delivering biocides and additives for plastics,
polymers, metals and other industrial applications, as well as by serving oil and gas suppliers (fracking
solutions). This is a service-driven industry with high demand for in-depth expertise to support customers
in product composition, regulation and production.

The market is focusing on alternative and environmentally friendly materials (for example, replacement of
traditional plastics with alternative composite materials). The rising demand for services and innovations
for new compositions is expected to benefit players with a focus on active ingredients and a strong
established service and R&D offerings.

Regulations regarding the ban of plastics also lead to a rise in demand for innovative solutions (new
compositions) to use for alternative materials. The regulatory impact for market leaders is assessed to be
limited, due to their broad portfolio.

**_Crop Protection_**

_Industry overview_

The addressable market in crop protection (‘‘CP’’) includes molluscicides, selected pesticides (herbicides,
fungicides and insecticides) and adjuvants, which aim to protect crops (such as fruits, vegetables and nuts)
from pests leading to increased yields. We are only present in selected segments of the market (for
example, molluscicides) and regions (for example, Brazil). The overall crop protection market is expected
to grow at a 4.0% CAGR, from 2020 to 2025.

Our key competitors are global agrochemical producers including Corteva, BASF, Syngenta, Bayer and
FMC.

_Underlying Market Trends_

The growth of the crop protection market is primarily driven by megatrends, including the growing
population, rising disposable income per capita and increasing consumption of meat, as well as the
rejuvenation of product portfolios (partially driven by regulation, as the EU is putting pressure on older
molecules). However, there are risks of potential limitations or bans on selected ingredients, for example,
metaldehyde (a key ingredient in molluscicides) due to the long-term risks to birds and mammals. As a
result, the crop protection market for consumers is increasingly shifting towards biopesticides, although the
crop protection market for professionals continues to prefer traditional pesticides due to their higher
effectiveness.

**_Specialty Chemicals Services_**

Our specialty chemicals businesses include Performance Intermediates and Chemicals, Composite
Materials and CDMO and address a broad range of industrial and consumer end-markets. The
addressable market is expected to grow in correlation with GDP growth.

**_Performance Intermediates and Chemicals_**

_Industry Overview_

The PIC market field offers a broad range of chemistries, which serve a wide array of end-markets. Within
this market, at our Visp site we produce ketene derivatives, diketene derivatives, and HCN derivatives,
primarily used as intermediates across end-markets. We also produce cracker products such as niacin
(vitamin B3), methylbutynol (‘‘MBI’’) and acetylene, for animal feed, human nutrition, and cosmetics
end-markets. At our Nanjing, China, site, we produce PMDA, which is primarily used for films in high-end
electronics and insulation. Our hydrazine solutions and propellant products are produced in our site in
Lake Charles, USA and are also used in a wide range of applications such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals,
water and the space industry.

_Underlying Market Trends_

Acetylene and MBI are intermediates used in animal feed, human nutrition and cosmetics applications,
primarily for the production of vitamins A and E as well as in the flavor and fragrance industry. Acetylene
is not transported in large volumes from the point of production, making supply proximity key. MBI is a
derivative of acetylene, with additional applications in agricultural and industrial applications. The key
end-market drivers include livestock population growth, human population growth and supplement
penetration.

Vitamin B3 is an ingredient used primarily in the animal feed, human nutrition, and other chemical
intermediate end-markets. Vitamin B3 is less differentiated in its use in animal feed applications, while
human nutrition applications require a greater degree of specialization due to health and safety
regulations. There are two variants of vitamin B3, niacin and niacinamide, which are produced through
separate value chains, but serve the same end-markets. We are a leading player in vitamin B3.

The key end-market drivers for vitamin B3 include livestock population, human population growth and
supplement penetration. From 2017 to 2020, the vitamin B3 market grew at an approximately 0.7%
CAGR, primarily due to increasing usage of supplements in animal food, global population growth and
increasing consumption of meat and fish, partially offset by livestock population decline in APAC due to
African swine fever. From 2020 to 2025, the vitamin B3 market is expected to grow at an approximately 3%
CAGR, driven predominantly by a bounce back in the livestock population in APAC after the expected end
of the Covid-19 pandemic and increasing protein and supplements consumption, both for animal feed and
human nutrition, due to health trends.

Ketene and diketene derivatives have various applications as intermediates across different end-markets.
Due to the limited shelf life of ketene, which turns into diketene soon after production, consumption
typically occurs close to the point of production. Both products are unlikely to be substituted, given the
essential nature of the intermediates in the value chain, the diversified end-markets in which these
products are used, and the capital expenditures required to build new production capacity.

In terms of volume, our main ketene derivative product is acetic anhydride, which is an intermediate with
applications across consumer, pharmaceutical, vitamin and wood applications. Acetic anhydride is also
used in cellulose acetate filters.

Our main diketene derivative products are CAAEt and AAEMA, which are more specialized niche
derivatives. CAAEt is primarily used in L-Carnitine for animal feed and human nutrition, as well as
various pharmaceutical and therapeutic intermediates, with additional applications in agricultural chemical
intermediates. AAEMA is primarily used in resin formulations as an additive for paints and coatings
applications, to increase durability and stickiness of coatings, with additional other applications as fillers,
sealants, and adhesives. We are a leading global provider of CAAEt and AAEMA.

Growth across the addressable ketene and diketene derivative markets is expected to be neutral-to-positive
depending on markets and applications. Growth in acetic anhydride is expected to be stable, largely
dependent on key market segments. In CAAEt, growth is expected to be positive, driven by nutrition,

pharmaceutical and agricultural markets. Overall, growth is expected to be stable, with global ketene and
diketene consumption expected to grow at approximately 2% to 3% from 2019 to 2025.

HCN is a highly reactive chemical compound produced from ammonium and methane. HCN is not
transported and is generally consumed at the production site. We primarily produce cyanogen chlorides,
which are niche specialty HCN derivatives. Cyanogen chlorides make up a small fraction of the overall
HCN market, accounting for approximately 3% of consumption in 2020, with the remainder of the
consumption volume split between other chemical derivatives, such as adiponitrile, methionine and
analogs, sodium cyanide and methionine.

Our main cyanogen chloride products are malonitrile (‘‘MDN’’), chlorosulfonyl isocyanate derivatives
(‘‘CSI’’), cyanate esters and sodium dichloroacetate (‘‘NaDCA’’). MDN is primarily used in
pharmaceutical, vitamins, and pesticide applications. CSI is primarily used as intermediates for active
pharmaceutical ingredient syntheses, and polymer production. Cyanate resin is primarily used for
composite materials. NaDCA is primarily used as active ingredient in the hygiene and water business. With
these HCN based products, we have a global leading role. Growth in overall HCN consumption has been
flat from 2015 to 2020. From 2020 to 2025, overall HCN consumption for existing products is expected to
grow at an approximately 1% CAGR, with consumption of niche cyanogen chloride derivatives expected to
grow slightly above HCN growth.

**_Composite Materials_**

_Industry Overview_

Composite materials are the product of combining two or more constituent materials into a singular
‘composite’ matrix, which provide unique functional properties different from that of the individual
materials. Within the composites value chain, we produce resin components and resin systems, which are
incorporated in the composite for critical, high-temperature resistant applications, primarily for the
electronics, aerospace, and industrial end-markets. Combined, the addressable market is expected to have
top-line growth of 6.8% from 2019 to 2025.

_Underlying Market Trends_

For the Electronics end-market, we produce Primaset� resins, which are used as a high-performance raw
material, mostly for printed circuit boards (‘‘PCBs’’) for telecommunications infrastructure, with some
applications for integrated circuits. Within PCBs, cyanate ester resins are utilized in high-end lamination
and encapsulation processes, where superior dielectric and thermal performance is required.

The key market growth drivers for this end-market are primarily telecommunications and IT infrastructure
spending, including applications in servers and base stations, with growth also driven by 4G/5G radio
access network spending. Spending for core IT and network infrastructure is expected to grow at a 4%
CAGR from 2020 to 2024, with rapid increases in networking, cloud computing, and other data-intensive
functions, driving higher technical requirements for high-speed servers, where cyanate ester resins are used
today. Growth is also expected in high-end electronic devices, where innovative technology continues to
develop.

For the Aerospace end-market, we produce Primaset� resins, used as a high-performance raw material, as
well as high-end hardeners (Lonzacure�), used as a curing agent primarily for epoxy resins, that are used in
composite materials for commercial and military aircraft. Composite materials are increasingly used in
aircraft bodies, wings, and turbine blades, to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency.

The key market growth driver for this end-market is new aircraft builds, both commercial and military,
with some growth also driven by maintenance, repair, and overhaul. The new commercial aircraft build
market is expected to experience a strong rebound in growth, following 2020 troughs driven by Covid-19
related interruptions, returning to pre-Covid-19 levels over the next four to five years, with an
approximately 6.4% CAGR expected from 2019 to 2025. In new military aircraft builds, demand has
remained robust, and is expected to quickly recover from Covid-19 lows over the next year, with an
approximately 2.3% CAGR expected from 2019 to 2025. Overall, commercial and military aircraft
production is expected to see growth of approximately 5% from 2019 to 2025.

For the Industrial end-market, we produce DETDA80, a curing agent primarily for polyurethane and
polyurea resins, serving a wide range of industrial applications, including wheels and rollers.

129


-----

The key market growth driver for this end-market is the global polyurethane market, which is expected to
grow in-pace with industrial output. Polyurethane production is expected to grow at a rate of
approximately 3.3% from 2019 to 2025, driven by a fast rebound from Covid-19, which resulted in a 5%
decline from 2019 to 2020 as a result of factory closures in the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.

**_CDMO_**

_Industry Overview_

Contract development and manufacturing organizations (‘‘CDMOs’’) are businesses which partner with
customers as a way to outsource product research and manufacturing and de-risk projects by leveraging
third-party capabilities. CDMO partners usually offer development and manufacturing capabilities that
allow their customers to add missing technological skills or forgo making their own investments while
shortening time-to-market. As a result, they typically provide expanded production platforms, often more
efficient cost bases and reduced time-to-market. In this industry, we have historically provided CDMO
services in the agricultural chemical and biotech / fermentation industries. Of these, we have primarily
served the agricultural chemical CDMO end-market, which is expected to grow at a 2% to 3% CAGR
from 2019 to 2025. Since 2020, we have broadened our target market with some success and are actively
exploring opportunities in non-traditionally served market fields. For example, we became the partner of
choice for an industrial application in novel batteries.

_Underlying Market Trends_

For the agricultural chemicals CDMO market, we primarily synthesize intermediates or agricultural
chemical active ingredients for large agricultural companies. The applications for these active ingredients
fall into three principal categories: herbicides for the control of weeds, insecticides for the control of
insects, and fungicides for the control of fungi and molds. These products are mainly used for the
protection of various crops, including fruits and vegetables, cereal, soybeans, rice, cotton, and rapeseed.

The agricultural chemicals CDMO market is primarily driven by the underlying agricultural chemicals end
market, which defines the underlying customer base for the agricultural chemicals CDMO market, and the
universe of molecules to be outsourced to CDMO partners. The key growth drivers for the broad
agricultural chemicals market are primarily structural, such as demographic changes alongside farm
economics. From 2015 to 2019, the agricultural chemicals market has grown at a 1% to 2% CAGR, driven
largely by crop oversupply lowering crop prices and increasing distributor inventory levels. From 2019 to
2024, the agricultural chemicals market is expected to grow at a 2% to 3% CAGR, primarily due to
continuing population growth and increasing meat consumption, as well as improvement in farm
economics following inventory de-stocking and the impact of trade wars. The shift toward eco-friendly,
precision agriculture and increased usage of bio-technologies driving more efficient production, is also
expected to contribute to broad agricultural chemical growth.

Other factors driving agricultural chemicals CDMO market growth include the rise of generic players with
limited degrees of CDMO outsourcing, as well as the share of outsourcing by large agricultural chemicals
players. From 2015 to 2019, as farm economics weakened, low-cost generic agricultural chemical producers
increased pressure on large agricultural chemical producers, taking share as farmers sought to cut cost.
Share of outsourcing among large agricultural chemicals companies has remained stable over time, with
increasingly complex molecules driven by crop yield requirements and growing regulation requiring the
technology and expertise of CDMO partners.

Overall, broad agricultural chemical market growth, as well as stable share of outsourcing in the large
agricultural chemical producers, have contributed to a 1% to 2% CAGR in the agricultural chemical
CDMO market from 2015 to 2019. From 2019 to 2025, the agricultural chemical CDMO market is
expected to grow at a 2% to 3% CAGR, driven primarily by improving farm economics and increasing
pressure on crop yields, as the need for efficient production continues.

In this general context, companies based in higher-cost regions in Europe may not offer a superior cost
structure to companies with operations in lower-cost geographies. Customers typically use European
suppliers when IP protection is more relevant than cost. However, in a limited overall market with limited
growth, companies must explore new, higher-growth market fields. We have therefore broadened our
offerings to other industrial segments.

capacity expansion of Primaset from 2018 to 2020, all at our Visp facility. We have also made significant
investments related to EHS, with our aggregate operational expenses on EHS concerns amounting to
CHF9 million, CHF11 million and CHF15 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
respectively, while our capital expenditures on EHS amounting to CHF20 million, CHF30 million and
CHF31 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Our operational setup for the Microbial Control Solutions business unit reflects the broad technology base
for actives and formulated products, allowing us to leverage our technology base across diverse end
markets. This provides a key competitive advantage in being able to combine our technology to support
differentiated and more targeted offerings while providing for lower costs. In addition, our broad
manufacturing and technology base allows us to backward integrate key products into our own active
ingredients and provides our business with a stable, resilient portfolio of actives allowing for good capital
utilization. Our Specialty Chemical Services business unit is able to provide lower costs and offer
differentiated and more targeted offerings to our customers through our unique expertise and
complementary combination of chemical and fermentation solutions, our highly automated cracker and
downstream plant setup at Visp, our fixed cost absorption and integrated production network and our best
practice and knowledge sharing with small and medium enterprises that are based in Visp. These
technology platforms enable us to provide valuable commercial benefits to our customers.

**_Attractive financial profile with strong cash flow generation_**

We have historically delivered resilient cash flows with growing sales to third parties (on a currencyadjusted basis), Normalized Adjusted EBITDA margin and cash conversion. In particular, our business
model, including our recent focus on directing our portfolio towards higher growth and higher margin
products, has proven its resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic, with strong performance in 2020.

Our diverse mix of products, end markets, customers and geographies results in stability through economic
and raw material cycles as demonstrated by our 2020 growth in sales to third parties of 3.5% on a constant
currency basis (decrease of 2.1% on an actual currency basis). We have a strong focus on continuous
operational improvements, for example our recent cost of goods sold improvement program that focused
on fixed cost reduction, alternative chemical routes, debottlenecking and variable cost reduction, and a
demonstrated pricing excellence as well as ability to pass through costs, driving our 2020 Normalized
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%. Our track record of delivering on productivity and operational
optimization opportunities has led to an attractive financial profile resulting in high cash conversion of
76.6% in 2020 (calculated as (i) Normalized Adjusted EBITDA _less capital expenditures_ _plus change in_
operating net working capital divided by (ii) Normalized Adjusted EBITDA). We believe that our business
has a significant opportunity to drive cost savings and increase profitability margins, particularly through
our new cost savings initiatives related to our Transformation Program and because, as a standalone
company, we will no longer be part of a more pharmaceutically oriented company.

We have a strong financial trajectory, underpinned by a clear portfolio strategy towards our high-margin
Microbial Control Solutions business unit and penetration of attractive Specialty Chemical Services niches.
We have clear strategies and initiatives to grow, optimize and protect our businesses with the Microbial
Control Solutions and Specialty Chemical Services business units, with increased focus on attractive
‘‘growth’’ businesses, such as the Hygiene market field. In particular, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic
and trends in consumer preferences, we expect that the Hygiene market field will continue to grow as
products in this market field continue to serve a critical function for customers. These growth businesses
offer high and sustainable growth rates with higher margins, which drives overall profitability.

**_Highly experienced management team, leading talented workforce and highly committed financial sponsors_**

We benefit from a strong and experienced management team, consisting of our senior management and
heads of certain corporate and business functions, with a proven track record in the specialty chemicals
markets and over 140 years of combined experience in the specialty chemicals industry. Our Chief
Operating Officer, Antje Gerber, joined LSI in 2019 and was appointed as COO in 2020, bringing
substantial experience from previous positions at Venator Materials (formerly Huntsman), HB Fuller and
Evonik. In addition to our management team, we have a lean and efficient organizational structure
powered by talent, expertise and a passion to create real value as a market leader supported by a
well-trained global workforce with high employee satisfaction reflected in long tenures, low turnover and
strong performance.

137


-----

We also benefit from the experience of our Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven, who each have a track
record in successful execution within similar environments and realizing cost savings, with 25 carve-out
transactions since 2010 and over 15 transactions in the chemicals and materials market. Bain Capital and
Cinven have also worked together previously, including on the 2017 public takeover of STADA, a leading
pharmaceuticals business, which they continue to own jointly.

**Our Strategies**

As a result of our recent carve-out from Lonza, the Acquisition and the resulting organizational changes
and strategy review, we are fully focused on delivering our growth strategy, which builds on four main
pillars:

**_Unlock growth_**

We are confident that we can unlock growth in our business through our numerous initiatives and are well
positioned to address and capitalize on current, fundamental market trends. These trends include
tightening regulatory landscapes, evolving customer preferences, increasing focus on the environment and
sustainability, increasing focus on safeguarding people and resources and growing end-customer base.

The tightening regulatory landscapes around the world, in particular in the United States and Europe, are
creating opportunities for us to utilize our regulatory expertise to grow our business. In particular, we
believe our Hygiene market field is well positioned for growth by expanding our complementary
formulation platform and supplemental registration model in North America and capitalizing on
significant upcoming BPR-related commercial opportunities in Europe.

Evolving customer preferences present opportunities for us to grow our business in new end markets. For
example, we are seeing an increased demand for low temperature laundry applications in Home and
Personal Care and have developed new products to address that market. Additionally, the implementation
of 5G telecommunications systems presents an opportunity for us to develop and market 5G-related
electronics applications within our Composites market field. Further, the increasing global focus on the
environment and sustainability has opened up new R&D-driven opportunities, particularly in our Paints
and Coatings market field, such as marine antifouling, and within our Composites market field for light
weight-related opportunities in aerospace applications. In addition, concerns about safeguarding people’s
wellbeing and resources is creating opportunities in Hygiene through forward integration of ingredients
into ready-to-use formulated solutions and in Wood Protection through demand for replacement
technologies that address environmental and regulatory concerns. For example, upcoming BPR regulations
in Europe will impact the production and use of creosote (which we do not produce) and we expect that
our substitute product, Tanasote, will be well positioned to address these upcoming regulations.

The growing middle class, particularly in South America, is leading to above average growth in consumer
related markets such as home and personal care and hygiene, and we have seen year-on-year growth in our
Microbial Control Solutions business unit in Latin America of greater than 42% in 2020. We expect growth
to continue in these markets and believe we are well positioned through our global manufacturing
footprint and our extensive R&D and regulatory capability to continue to address customer needs in these
markets.

**_Drive innovation_**

Our research and development operations are key to maintaining our sector-leading innovation and ability
to respond to market developments and customer needs and are a core component of our customer
offering. Our ability to anticipate and navigate the regulatory environments in key jurisdictions allows us to
commercialize our products. We have a full pipeline of innovation projects across market fields which we
manage rigorously through a stage-gated R&D process, which was implemented in 2020 to focus more on
market and customer driven innovations. This process aims to continuously evaluate projects to assess
their ability to deliver real value to our customers and ability to successfully make it to market.

Our innovation projects are driven by market and customer needs for applications that make a difference
and are a key driver of revenue growth, particularly for our Microbial Control Solutions business unit.
Many of our projects are joint R&D efforts with our customers, which are sometimes co-funded by our
customers. Some of our innovations use the capabilities of our cross-business unit network, for example,
the development and scale up of new antidandruff products by our Specialty Chemical Services business
unit for a customer need within our Microbial Control Solutions business unit. We expect to continue to

138


-----

invest in our R&D, maintaining similar levels of investment in R&D as in past years and to look for ways
to capitalize on cross-business unit capabilities to enhance our offerings.

Our ability to commercialize the knowledge we have from our years of regulatory experience sets us apart
from our competitors. We work closely with regulators throughout the entire development process to
ensure that we have solutions for upcoming regulatory challenges. We will continue to develop strong
relationships with key regulatory stakeholders and focus on and develop our regulatory expertise to
strengthen our customer relationships through joint projects with our customers.

**_Manage the portfolio_**

We will continue to focus on highly attractive end markets that offer significant structural growth potential
with an aim to expand our operations in profitable niche markets within the high-growth microbial control
market and attractive niches within the specialty chemical services market. We intend to utilize our
strengths in research and development and regulatory expertise to continue to develop and commercialize
new products for these end markets. We continue to actively manage our portfolio, with clear strategies for
each of the business units and market fields, particularly within our higher-growth businesses. We expect
these strategies will lead to topline and profitability increases going forward.

We are experiencing above-market growth rates in our Microbial Control Solutions business unit, which is
expected to exhibit strong underlying end-market growth of 4.3% CAGR over the period from 2019 to
2025, complemented by selected growth opportunities in other attractive market verticals. This market
growth is driven by a shift to more formulated and higher value products as a result of regulatory and
consumer preferences. Our strong R&D initiatives are particularly vital in our Hygiene, Home and
Personal Care, Paints and Coatings and Wood and Crop Protection market fields. We expect growth in end
markets served by our Hygiene market field, which accounted for 16% of our 2020 sales to third parties, to
be 9.1% over the period from 2019 to 2025 and to be largely driven by Covid-19 increasing the need for
protection of health creating a ‘‘new normal’’ in the use of disinfectants and a permanent shift to more
formulated and higher value products due to tightening regulatory landscapes. Growth in end markets
served by our Home and Personal Care market field, which accounted for 14% of our 2020 sales to third
parties, is expected to be 2.4% and is largely driven by increasing customer awareness of preservation
systems and smart formulations to reduce preservative concentrations and Covid-19 positively impacting
the home care market due to higher hygiene sensitivity and demand for cleanliness and germ-free
solutions. Growth in end markets served by our Wood Protection market field, which accounted for 19% of
our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be 3.5% and is largely driven by increasing popularity of wood
construction due to climate neutrality and sustainability and growth in North America due to higher usage
of wood in construction and greater variety in applications. Growth in end markets served by our Paints
and Coatings market field, which accounted for 7% of our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be
4.5% and is largely driven by positive sales mix-effect due to shifts from solvent-based paints to waterbased paints and increasing usage of high-performance paints in emerging markets. Growth in end markets
served by our Material Protection market field, which accounted for 6% of our 2020 sales to third parties,
is expected to be 4.2% and is largely driven by oil and gas exploration by fracking as well as the
fast-growing plastics industry.

For Specialty Chemical Services we are targeting steady GDP-linked growth, driven by fast growing niche
businesses, particularly in the Composite Materials and CDMO market fields. The strong growth in these
areas is largely driven by focused innovation initiatives. Our highly profitable Composite Materials market
field is focused on serving the growing demand in the industrial and electronics end markets, while CDMO
activities are shifting towards higher value products and improved capacity utilization. Growth in end
markets (e.g., base chemicals such as ethylene and acetylene and pharmaceutical and vitamin
intermediates) served by our PIC market field, which accounted for 24% of our 2020 sales to third parties,
is largely driven by a clear focus on the most attractive niches, including high-tech industrial applications,
and serving pharma and vitamin end markets and underlying Vitamin B3 consumption growth, particularly
growth in animal feed and supplements penetration. Growth in end markets served by our CDMO market
field, which accounted for 7% of our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be 2% to 3% per year from
2019 to 2025 and is largely driven by increasing outsourcing of agrochemical players as well as serving
customers across various industries in need for complex chemical processes or fermentation. Growth in
end markets (e.g., electronics, industrial and transportation) served by our Composite Materials market
field, which accounted for 4% of our 2020 sales to third parties, is expected to be 6.8% per year from 2019
to 2025 and is largely driven by growth of high performance composite materials in electronics and
industrial applications.

**_Business transformation and operational excellence_**

Our business plan includes organic initiatives based on sales and innovation projects to drive topline
growth. The portfolio shift towards high-margin Microbial Control Solutions end markets and
development of attractive Specialty Chemical Services niches is anticipated to drive growth and increase
sales to third parties to above CHF2.1 billion by 2025. We have already seen that our increased focus on
these markets in 2020 has contributed to higher growth, notably in areas with above average profitability
(e.g., Hygiene with fully fledge solutions compared to raw material sales). This has already contributed not
only to top line growth but also to substantial margin improvement for our Microbial Control Solutions
business unit in 2020. We believe our organic initiatives will secure our business plan as a standalone
company for the next five years. Additionally, under new ownership we expect to be able to tap into further
growth ideas and M&A beyond the current business plan.

The second part of our business transformation is operational excellence. Existing cost savings initiatives in
operations will continue to gain momentum over the medium term. ‘‘Pivot’’ is an established program
aimed at cost of goods sold improvements, including fixed cost reduction, alternative chemical routes,
debottlenecking and variable cost reduction. Pivot initially started in Visp and has since been rolled out to
other sites and has, for example, enabled our Mapleton facility to implement its Covid-19 related ramp up
in record time. ‘‘Blackbird’’ is a focused program for operational excellence at our four main Microbial
Control Solutions sites in the US with tailored projects for each facility and is already delivering benefits at
our site in Rochester. We began implementing a global supply chain integration and network optimization
in 2019, with a focus on inventory management and plan to increase customer focus supply chain
initiatives. We will also continue to improve our Visp manufacturing site with a focus on automation,
control room and plant consolidation and digitization measures. Finally, there are numerous initiatives in
operations supporting business growth in our Microbial Control Solutions business unit, with the key
initiatives being improving efficiency gains by streamlining our asset footprint and further increasing our
quat production output. Our operations organization has delivered significant gross profit improvements
and we believe it will continue to do so going forward.

In addition, following the completion of the Acquisition, we intend to implement the Transformation
Program, which is focused on cost savings opportunities related to (i) manufacturing; (ii) raw materials
procurement; (iii) indirect spend control; (iv) sales and marketing costs; (v) G&A costs; and (vi) R&D
costs. We expect to realize cost savings of CHF69 million within 18 months after the Acquisition Closing
Date and an additional CHF2 million from IT cost savings, assuming, among other things, that the
program will be implemented beginning on the Acquisition Closing Date and driven by key management.
We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to approximately CHF103 million between 2021 and 2023 in
connection with these initiatives, comprising: (i) approximately CHF58 million in expected one-off costs,
including severance costs, IT costs and program delivery costs, including consulting, financial and legal
advisory fees in connection with implementing our Transformation Program; and (ii) approximately
CHF45 million in expected capital expenditure related to manufacturing savings.

**History**

Lonza’s history dates back to 1897, when Lonza AG Electricity Works was founded in Gampel, Canton of
Valais, Switzerland, on the banks of the river Lonza. The company moved to Visp in 1909 and over the
years expanded into chemical and biotech areas. It significantly expanded in 1969, beginning operations in
the United States and starting a chemical specialties business. In 1974, Lonza merged with Alusuisse, but
de-merged from the combined Alusuisse-Lonza Group in 1999. In 2011, Lonza acquired Arch Chemicals,
a global biocides company providing innovative solutions to destroy or to selectively inhibit the growth of
harmful microorganisms, to create the world’s leading microbial control business.

While our business was historically integrated with Lonza’s operations, Lonza began the separation
process to facilitate the Acquisition in 2013 with the creation of LSI as its separate segment on the basis of
Arch Chemicals’ legacy business. In 2015, LSI acquired Zelam, a New Zealand company, to boost its
agricultural ingredients and wood protection market fields and Diacon, a Canadian business specialized in
the prevention of mold growth on freshly cut wood, and implemented a series of portfolio shifts to enhance
market focus. In 2019, we discontinued our cyanuric chloride business and manufacturing in Visp. In 2020,
our two business units, Microbial Control Solutions and Specialty Chemical Services, were formed.

_Specialty Chemical Services business unit_

Innovation in our Specialty Chemical Services business unit is focused on product development for
Composite Materials and process development for our other products, and is led by development teams in
Visp and Kouˇrim.

As at December 31, 2020, the Visp development team employed 41 full-time R&D specialists focused on
process and analytical development for the Visp chemical CDMO, as well as Composite Materials and PIC
market fields’ operations run out of there. It also oversees pre-formulation development for the global
Composite Materials market field and provides analytical services for all development projects. Following
the general CDMO strategy, we are continuing to consolidate activities with the move of development
work from Visp to Kouˇrim for biotech CDMO. We expect this to lead to general savings and performance
improvement. Process optimization specialists also support the PMDA site in Nanjing.

Our Analytical Development team is embedded within our Visp R&D team but works cross-functionally.
The Analytical Development team specializes in development of new analytical methods and process
improvements. A core strength of this team is trend analyses and other analyses of complex data generated
by multiple inputs, which help us continually improve our quality control processes. Our Analytical
Development team is also our center of excellence for non-routine analytical questions from customers or
analytical questions that may arise as part of our production and quality control processes.

As at December 31, 2020, the Kouˇrim development team employed 22 full-time R&D specialists focused
on process development for fermentation applications for the Kouˇrim biotech CDMO. After the
integration of the tasks performed by the Visp development team, it will grow up to 26 full-time
equivalents, leading to an overall reduction of two full-time equivalents.

The business unit’s development teams have a proven track record of innovation with a total of 13 new
products launched between 2018 and 2020.

_Regulatory Assurance_

The solutions offered by our Microbial Control Solutions business unit are often reliant on regulatory
approvals in various jurisdictions. Over the years, we have developed what we believe to be an unmatched
regulatory expertise, especially in key markets of the European Union and the United States. We are a
trusted regulatory solution provider for our customers in those highly regulated markets characterized by a
declining number of actives and increasing importance of registrations for customers. We help provide our
customers with a license to operate, which enables them to penetrate markets with minimal delay. For
example, we recently supported a major customer with registered formulations for Hygiene. We also have a
focus on regulatory stewardship, with an advocacy program to educate consumers and public decisionmakers on the critical need for sanitation products.

In the United States, we currently have 42 biocidal active ingredients registered or under review with the
EPA. We also have 412 federal registrations and 1,742 supplemental registrations for formulations. EPA’s
fees for registration of a new active can be as high as US$200,000, whilst the costs for re-registering existing
products are much lower. We have the expertise to generate required data and support registrations of new
and existing client portfolios (which allows extension of claims and applications and offers our customers a
fast route with market ready solutions).

In the European Union, we support 20 different active ingredients under various product types under the
BPR, which results in 110 separate ingredients / product type combinations supported by individual
registration dossiers. Formulations are still in a transition phase under the BPR, adopted in 2013. We also
support 540 national registrations in various European countries, which are required for BPR product
authorizations. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we spent CHF2 million of capital expenditures on
BPR, REACH and EPA-related regulatory assurance.

As at December 31, 2020, our Microbial Control Solutions business unit employed 75 full-time regulatory
focused specialists across its various locations. This market-leading team has all required local and
international regulatory capabilities and remains on the forefront of the evolving regulatory environment
to help ensure that current and future products comply with varying regional specific regulations that
underpin the wide range of industries and markets our Microbial Control Solutions business unit
addresses. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we spent CHF10 million on regulatory assurance
personnel costs.

155


-----

**Procurement**

Our aggregate expenditure on supplies is approximately CHF1 billion per annum. We procure more than
5,000 raw materials from over 5,000 suppliers with over 70,000 orders per year.

_Efficient Procurement_

We seek to enable a competitive cost base, flexibility and supply security for both our business units.
Factors we prioritize to ensure efficient procurement include the separation of strategic and operational
procurement; category management for streamlined sourcing process and optimized spend; local presence
at manufacturing sites and central strategic procurement organizations at regional and global levels;
actively managed interfaces and integrated business processes with product management and pricing; and
risk management by key raw materials and sales / margins impact analysis, given the lack of concentration
in raw materials.

We focus on a continuous and timely supply, with a purchased goods portfolio at optimized cost. Our
on-site procurement ensures fast reaction time and high flexibility for manufacturing and our integrated
procurement processes enable optimized inventory management. We manage volatility of key raw
materials and interface with product pricing at our market fields.

_Dedicated Supply Chain Organization_

We have a dedicated supply chain organization that was entirely reorganized during the Carve-out. The
current structure has been set up with continuous improvement in mind and a particular focus on
complexity reduction, inventory management and customer service. It integrates suppliers and contract
manufacturing partners into our global operations network and separates strategically important global
activities from more operational regional tasks, allowing for efficient processes and enabling further
improvement on key performance metrics.

As at the date of this offering memorandum, this new organization employed approximately 250 full-time
specialists to foster operational excellence in our global supply network. We have a three-fold strategy to
further improve our supply chain: (1) improvement of services, (2) reduction of inventory and
(3) reduction of complexity. Improvement of services involves on time in full delivery, order entry accuracy
and back order management. Reduction of inventory involves reversal of the trend of inventory growth and
the improvement of our inventory management processes. We plan to reduce complexity by reducing
network complexity, product complexity and end market complexity.

We have implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct based on the Principles of the United Nations Global
Compact as well as the Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management.
This code of conduct covers issues including: fair competition and ethics; labor rights; health and safety
and environmental impact. We expect our suppliers to have internal measuring procedures to guarantee
adherence to this code of conduct and to report violations to us. We have integrated this code of conduct
into our contracts and reserve the right to request corrective actions or to terminate contracts if suppliers
do not follow the code of conduct.

**Sales and Marketing**

_Customer Base_

We have many longstanding client relationships. Serving over 5,300 customers worldwide, we are deeply
integrated into many of our customers’ value chains, such as by conducting sales of actives and
development of finished products together with our partners. We have supply relationships of over 20 years
with eight of our top ten customers, including some relationships over 50 years.

_Microbial Control Solutions business unit’s Sales and Marketing_

This business unit serves more than 4,300 customers through 29 dedicated sales offices strategically located
across EIMEA, APAC and the Americas. It has long-standing relationships with its key clients and sales to
ten largest customers represented 27% of its sales to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We have global and regional key account management for these strategic customers and support these
customers in collaborative partnerships. For example, we recently secured a long-term contract with a
major customer for FDA-approved ingredients for hand sanitization.

156


-----

The Microbial Control Solutions business unit heavily relies on direct sales and service (including fields
sales, inside sales, technical service and further expert support (such as regulatory)). Its direct sales
accounted for 91% of all its sales to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are
supplemented by sales via selected distribution partners.

_Specialty Chemical Services business unit’s Sales and Marketing_

This business unit serves approximately 1,000 customers through six dedicated sales offices across EIMEA,
APAC and the Americas. It has long-standing relationships with its key clients and sales to ten largest
customers represented 63% of its sales to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2020. At the same
time, sales to five largest customers represented 56% of its sales to third parties for the year. The business
unit has global sales leadership, key account and product management and business development located
in Basel, Switzerland, which is complemented by a small number of regional sales representatives.

The Specialty Chemical Services business unit mainly relies on direct sales, with such sales accounting for
approximately 80% of all its sales to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2020. The remaining
sales are made through a selection of specialized distribution partners, primarily in APAC.

**Intellectual Property**

Over the past five years, we have filed 56 new inventions for patent protection. Our intellectual property
portfolio currently consists of 150 active patent families, with 536 granted patents and 226 pending
applications globally, illustrating our extensive background knowledge, attained know-how and technology
platforms as a basis for new innovation. The vast majority of our patents are based on in-house
development. We also have comprehensive trademark protection, with over 512 unique trademarks
globally and a total of 2960 registrations or pending applications. The CDMO market field benefits from
the Lonza brand, which provides positive reputation for manufacturing and development.

Our key patents relate to the Azotek� and BARamine� technologies used in the Wood Protection market
field, Proxel� BZ+ products in the Paints and Coatings market field, as well as Nugen� EHP and
Lonzagard� HDS products in the Hygiene market field, all in our Microbial Control Solutions business
unit.

In addition to the above, our key trademarks include the Wolman� and Wolmanized� brands in the Wood
Protection market field and the Geogard� brand in the Hygiene market field, both in our Microbial
Control Solutions business unit, as well as our Primaset� brand in the Composite Materials market field of
the Specialty Chemical Services business unit.

**Employees**

_Employee Statistics_

As at December 31, 2020, we employed 2,849 full-time employees in 32 countries across six continents. We
expect this number to decrease in the short term as we implement our Transformation Program. Employee
turnover for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 11.4% (8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019).

_Our Culture_

We believe that our culture is a key differentiating factor on all our markets. We identify the following four
key values of such culture:

- **_Performance. In everything we do, we strive to create real value. In order to achieve that, we (a) say_**
what we do and do what we say; (b) make things better, challenging the way they are done; (c) own
our tasks; (d) make things happen, remaining flexible to seize opportunities; and (e) stick with it and
see things through.

- **_Collaboration. We work and think across boundaries to create solutions that make a difference. In_**
order to achieve that, we (a) work for the greater good, combining our talents to achieve extraordinary
results; (b) seek input, value diverse perspectives, listen and embrace different ideas as if our own;
(c) share workload and credit; (d) trust each other’s motives, experiences and expertise; and
(e) welcome and embrace feedback, communicating openly and directly with others.

- **_Passion. We act with courage on our conviction to make a meaningful impact in the world. In order to_**
achieve that, we (a) take the problems that need solving; (b) ask ‘‘What if?’’ and have the courage to
pursue it; (c) embrace failure as ‘‘success not yet’’, adjust and move fast; (d) are optimistic about our
future and have fun pursuing it together; and (e) celebrate each other and take great pride in our
work.

- **_Care. We believe what we do matters. Therefore, we (a) define our success in terms of impact we have_**
on our team, customers, business, society and environment; (b) go beyond what is required, taking
personal responsibility for safety and quality; (c) treat others as we wish to be treated and care about
their wellbeing; (d) make time to help each other; and (e) assume the best in others, challenging the
idea, not the person.

We continuously invest in our employees and in training and development programs. Additionally, our
business is guided by our code of conduct, which covers a broad range of issues, including: trade sanctions
and export controls; product quality; environment, health and safety; anti-discrimination and equal
employment opportunities; conflicts of interests; anti-corruption and anti-bribery; business gifts; insider
trading; fair competition; use and protection of business assets and confidential information; intellectual
property; accuracy of records; business partnerships; data privacy; data integrity and social media. This is
implemented through an ethics and compliance program designed to support legal and ethical actions
throughout the LSI Business and includes annual education and training for all employees.

_Trade Unions and Collective Bargaining_

At the local and national level, our employees in various jurisdictions, including Switzerland, are
represented by works councils or unions and subject to collective bargaining agreements. We rely on our
local management to maintain positive labor relations and to comply with legal requirements regarding
unions, works councils and other employee representation bodies. We respect these relationships and
strive to work with employee representatives in a mutually respectful manner.

In addition to country-specific employee representation, Lonza Group has also established a European
Works Council in which LSI employees are represented and which holds regular meetings. This is designed
to maintain a positive culture of information and communication with our European employees. In

158


-----

Lonza’s European Works Council, employees from all European countries in which Lonza has more than
100 employees (including Belgium, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Spain, the
United Kingdom and Switzerland) are represented by employee-nominated delegates. The European
Works Council is assisted and supported by a union secretary. Following the Transactions, LSI employees
will no longer be part of Lonza’s European Works Council. We expect that LSI employees will be
represented by works councils or unions on a local or national level in various of our jurisdictions,
including Switzerland.

_Pension Plans and Retirement_

_Defined-Benefit Pension Plans_

We operate defined-benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as other employee benefit plans
in various countries. Our major defined benefit plans are in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States. For pension accounting purposes, these plans are considered defined-benefit plans.

_Pension Plan in Switzerland_

Our Swiss pension plan is governed by the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors and
Disability Pension Plans (BVG), and is funded through a legally separate trustee-administered pension
fund (Pensionskasse der Lonza). The board of trustees is responsible for the investment of the assets, which
cannot revert to the LSI Business. The cash funding of these plans, which may from time to time involve
special payments, is designed to ensure that present and future contributions are sufficient to meet future
liabilities. The plan contains a cash balance benefit formula, accounted for as a defined-benefit plan
according to IAS19. Employer and employee contributions are defined in the pension fund rules in terms
of an age-related sliding scale of percentages of pay. Under Swiss law, the pension plan guarantees the
vested benefit amount as confirmed annually to members. Interest may be added to member balances at
the discretion of the board of trustees.

The risks linked to retirement benefits, including disability and death, have been reinsured until
December 31, 2021, following which we expect to extend such reinsurance. The investment risk is not
reinsured. Our insurance provider guarantees these retirement benefits and bears the investment, death
and disability risks. Retirement benefits are based on accumulated retirement capital (made up of yearly
contributions and the interest thereon), which can either be drawn as a life-long annuity or as a lump-sum
payment or a combination of the two. The board of trustees may adjust the annuity at its discretion subject
to the plan’s funded status including sufficient free funds as determined according to Swiss statutory
valuation rules.

Prior to 2020, our pension plan was sponsored only by Lonza Group without defined benefit liability
allocated to the LSI Business. In 2020, our employees in Switzerland were transferred to a separate legal
entity from Lonza Group, but continue to participate in the same pension plan as Lonza Group’s Swiss
employees. We concluded a specific affiliation agreement in accordance with Swiss law and consequently a
portion of the Swiss pension plan’s liability is now allocated to the LSI Business.

_Pension Plan in the United Kingdom_

We operate the Hickson UK Group Pension Scheme, which is closed to new entrants. In addition, the
scheme is registered under UK legislation, is contracted out of the State Second Pension and is subject to
the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation. The plan is managed by corporate trustee
bodies, which oversee investment strategy and general regulatory compliance. Hickson UK Group Pension
Scheme is the defined-benefit pension plan of the legacy UK Arch Chemicals business. Pensions are linked
to final salaries and service, and statutory increases apply, except where contractually different.

_Pension Plans in the United States_

We currently sponsor three qualified defined-benefit pension plans in the United States. All of the
defined-benefit pension plans are fully frozen with respect to future benefit accruals (with the exception of
a small group of participants). All eligible U.S. employees currently participate in a defined-contribution
retirement plan. Pension benefits for the majority of U.S. pension plan participants are generally based on
final average pay and credited service as of the date of termination or as of the date benefit accruals were
frozen (if earlier), and are payable as a lifetime pension. Participants in the cash balance formula under the
Pension Plan of Arch Chemicals are covered under an account-based formula that is credited each year

159


-----

with interest based on the yield on ten-year U.S. Treasury securities. Participants in these plans may
commence benefit payments upon attainment of normal retirement age or, if applicable, as of an early
retirement age (usually age 55) provided the criteria for early retirement have been met as of the
participant’s termination of employment. Participants in the cash balance plan may elect to commence
benefits upon termination of employment either in a single lump sum or as a lifetime annuity, or they may
defer payment to a later date.

Pension benefit payments from the qualified pension plans are paid from a trustee-administered fund. The
qualified defined-benefit pension plans, whose assets are held in a master trust, are subject to minimum
funding requirements and are subject to further regulations under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the
U.S. Employees Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Actuarial valuations are completed
each year for each plan to determine the contribution requirement. The plan sponsor may elect to
contribute more than the minimum, in which case the excess amounts may under certain circumstances be
used to offset future funding requirements.

**Sustainability; Environment, Health and Safety**

We are dedicated to providing the highest quality products and services to our customers, while minimizing
our impact on the environment, striving for energy and resource efficiency and helping to improve life
quality.

As part of this commitment, we foster transparency and reporting in line with the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) Standards, which represent the industry standard for reporting on economic,
environmental and social indicators.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, our aggregate operational expenses on EHS
concerns amounted to CHF9 million, CHF11 million and CHF15 million, respectively, while our capital
expenditures on EHS amounted to CHF20 million, CHF30 million and CHF31 million, respectively.

_Commitment to Sustainability_

Sustainability is a key consideration for us and we expect it to be an integral part of our strategy moving
forward. We are dedicated to providing the highest quality products and services to our customers, while
minimizing our impact on the environment, striving for energy- and resource-efficiency and helping to
improve quality of life.

As a part of our overarching commitment to sustainability, we are embedding material sustainability
performance indicators as we transition to operating as a standalone business. Long-term environmental
and social changes as well as changing customer preferences are having a significant impact on the
specialty chemicals industry. We recognize the resource-intensive nature of our operations and that
sustainability is a high priority for governments and our customers. By defining sustainability targets early
on in our establishment as a standalone entity, we are communicating our commitment to reducing
environmental impact to our stakeholders.

The five key pillars of our commitment to sustainability are as follows:

- **_Compliance and integrity. Regulatory compliance, integrity and ethical conduct are the foundations in_**
every place we operate.

- **_Vision ZERO. Continuous improvements to our systems and aspiration to achieve ZERO incidents,_**
injuries or emissions.

- **_Our people. We strive to enable employee development. We provide our workforce with safe_**
workplaces, care for employees’ wellbeing and foster involvement and participation.

- **_Our environment. We seek to improve our environmental footprint by continually reducing energy,_**
water and material demand per unit.

- **_Value for society. Value creation through innovative solutions, developing the consumer products of_**
tomorrow. Community engagement where we operate.

_Sustainability KPIs_

As part of our commitment to becoming a low-carbon chemicals company, we intend to adopt key
performance indicators (‘‘KPIs’’) to track (i) our greenhouse gas (‘‘GHG’’) emissions and (ii) waste
intensity.

_(i) GHG emissions_

Our GHG emissions result mainly from combustion processes for energy generation, including
incineration of organic waste, and chemically generated CO2. We can manage part of our GHG emissions
by managing our energy consumption and energy sources. To decouple GHG emissions from energy
consumption, we strive to increase the percentage of renewable electricity that we use in our energy
consumption.

We intend to measure our GHG emissions intensity through a KPI measuring direct and indirect emissions
in terms of tons of CO2 equivalents based on total sales (CO2 equivalent tons divided by millions of Swiss
francs in sales). We intend to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 3% or more per year, and we target a
GHG emissions intensity reduction of 18% or more by 2024 and 36% by 2030, compared to our 2018
baseline of 484 of CO2 equivalent tons per million of Swiss francs in total sales.

_(ii) Waste intensity_

Our chemical manufacturing processes generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes as by-products,
which must be treated and disposed of according to the relevant applicable regulations. We strive to
remain transparent with stakeholders and local communities on our waste management policies and
practices and are committed to increasing input materials efficiency in our production processes, including
reworking out-of-specification production, to reduce waste generation from production, offices and
laboratories. Each of our manufacturing sites maintains a waste disposal operation tailored to its waste
streams for an efficient, environmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste outputs. All of our sites
are committed to our waste reduction principles: ‘‘avoid, reduce, recycle, treat, and dispose.’’

We intend to measure our waste intensity through a KPI measuring waste generated in tons based on total
sales (tons of waste generated divided by millions of Swiss francs in sales). We intend to reduce our waste
intensity by 2% per year, and we target a reduction in waste intensity of 12% by 2024 and 24% by 2030,
compared to our 2018 baseline of 49.5 tons of waste per million of Swiss francs in total sales.

_A Systematic Approach to Sustainability and EHS_

Our approach to sustainability is systematic. We have policies in place to define high-level principles and
an operating model for EHS management and process safety teams working closely with the sites. Our
EHS guidelines include Health Surveillance, Critical Work and EHS. We manage systems and policies on
incident tracking. We have provided for minimum standards to ensure safety of personnel. In addition, we
have plans in place for security and business continuity of each site, as well as construction site policies,
including contractor requirements.

We have a comprehensive set of methodologies, training programs and processes. These include
comprehensive risk assessment methodology and training, global training on causal analysis methodology
for safety incidents and annual safety and sustainability planning, as well as three-year roadmaps for each
manufacturing site.

Our approach to safety is underpinned by the values guiding individual behavior and decision making of
our employees. Each employee is accountable and responsible for labor practices and safe working
conditions.

_Vision ZERO Initiative_

Our Vision ZERO initiative was launched in 2015, focusing on safety and sustainability of operations. Our
aspiration is to achieve zero workplace injuries or illnesses, manufacturing process, environmental and
transportation incidents. We have programs developed for each individual site.

_Other Recent Initiatives_

- **_Recycling and Reutilization of Solvents in Visp. In 2020, we reused 20,000 tons of organic solvents_**
(approximately 40% of total amount used), with all other solvents used as fuel to generate steam and
electricity.

- **_Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Visp. We have invested and plan to continue to invest in a_**
catalytic converter at a continuously running plant at our Visp site to reduce our nitrous oxide
emissions at that plant by 98% per annum by the end of 2021. We expect this investment to total
approximately CHF12 million between 2019 and 2022, with CHF6 million of this investment
conducted in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our EHS function performs regular audits of all our production sites to identify EHS vulnerabilities and
recommend remedial actions. As a result of our sustainability and EHS policies and initiatives, 16 of our 18
manufacturing sites have gone without a lost time injury for more than one year.

**_Visp site_**

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, Lonza Group will remain fully responsible for all ongoing soil,
sub-soil and groundwater remediation initiatives at the jointly used Visp site. These include (i) the ongoing
remediation to address legacy mercury contamination and (ii) the landfill at Gamsenried, which require
remediation of various amines and solvents that may result in groundwater contamination.

**_Rochester site_**

In order to address EHS vulnerabilities identified at our Rochester site, we are installing a groundwater
pump and treatment system beneath the operating site to reduce concentrations of 2-chloropyridine in
wastewater by more than 80%. The aggregate cost of this initiative is currently expected to be
approximately US$830,000.

Note:

(1) Per 200,000 workhours.

A slight increase in our lost time incident frequency rate and our recordable incident frequency rate in
2020 was due to increased injury rates at our Visp, Rochester, and Conley sites. We have developed and
implemented safety improvement plans at each of the three sites.

**Insurance**

We believe that our businesses have reasonable insurance protection, to the extent customary in the
industry. We are insured under global group policies held by Lonza Group, including third-party (product)
liability, property damage and business interruption, and directors and officers liability insurance. In
addition, there are certain local insurance policies. Both global insurance policies and local insurance
policies remain to be mandated via the Lonza Group insurance broker. We are currently in the process of
establishing our own global group insurance policies, which would come into effect on the Acquisition
Closing Date, with support of a mandated insurance broker. For further information on risks related to our
insurance coverage, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain
_risks and unanticipated changes in our insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_competitive or financial position or our results of operations.’’_

**Information Technology**

Information Technology (‘‘IT’’) is an integral part of our organization, enabling efficient business processes
execution and process optimization, productivity increases and digitalization. Our IT landscape covers the
entire business value chain, from research and development to manufacturing and sales. In addition, it
supports the functional roles of finance, human resources, quality, safety, purchasing, etc. The key business
application platforms include SAP Landscape, SalesForce.com, Quality Management, among others.
While refreshing and consolidating applications, we are also assessing cloud options where meaningful. IT
infrastructure services are mostly outsourced and external services are used to ensure secure IT systems
and operations.

As at the date of this offering memorandum, our IT infrastructure and applications remain closely
integrated into one single platform with those of Lonza Group. This global IT infrastructure organization
operates, jointly with the outsourcing infrastructure service provider, a global data center physically located
in Visp and regional and local data rooms in various locations globally. The global IT organization enables
us to use Lonza Group’s ‘‘Applications’’, ‘‘Infrastructure’’ and ‘‘Security’’ platforms. The global IT team is
managing services outsourced to three key third-party providers for data center, workplace services and
service desk. In addition, there are two key third-party providers for network services (WAN) to cover all
regions globally. Global IT security and compliance team is managing joint IT infrastructure and systems
along with our third-party service providers. We also have local IT teams present at key sites to manage the
services on-site with close business proximity.

Lonza Group currently provides access to such joint IT services under the Global Services Agreements
(see ‘‘—Material Agreements—Post-Acquisition Arrangements with Lonza—Global Services Agreements’’).
We expect to achieve physical separation in selected areas, such as finance (consolidation, tax and
treasury), by the Acquisition Closing Date with remaining separation phases to occur during the life of the
relevant Global Services Agreements. However, we already have a dedicated IT team set up to manage the
IT aspects of the Carve-out, to define stand-alone IT infrastructure and systems and devise a stand-alone
IT strategy for us, as well as manage our business requirements from the IT perspective. In addition, we
have an IT application services organization that has been already separated into two parts, each covering
one of our operating divisions.

Following complete separation of our IT infrastructure and systems from those of Lonza Group, we aim to
radically simplify and harmonize them in line with best industry standards and practices to provide a
modern and secure IT landscape and infrastructure with a high degree of automation capabilities and
pragmatic delivery of IT services. In the stand-alone setup we strive for governing and managing the IT
project portfolio in alignment with the business needs and with focus on core projects delivering most
benefits and highest savings.

With regards to cyber security, our IT security team focuses on identifying and mitigating business risks by
providing around-the-clock active monitoring services on the basis of a risk-based vulnerability
management, emphasizing areas such as identity management, assets, network, organization and external
threat environment.

**Material Agreements**

_Post-Acquisition Arrangements with Lonza_

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, our relationship with Lonza Group will be based on, among other
things, the following key arrangements:

_Global Services Agreement_

In connection with the Carve-out and the Acquisition, Lonza Ltd (a Lonza Group entity) and Lonza
Solutions AG (an LSI entity) entered into the Global Services Agreement dated January 1, 2021 (the
**‘‘Global Services Agreement’’) covering, on a short-term basis, transitional services across various**
jurisdictions provided by Lonza Group to us. These transitional services include general administration
and business services, customs support, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources, compliance and tax
(in certain jurisdictions). The duration of the provision of each service varies by service line, up to a
maximum of 24 months for some service lines. Certain functions, like legal and intellectual property
support, will be supported under the Global Services Agreement only on an on-demand basis.

_Reverse Global Services Agreement_

Lonza Ltd and Lonza Solutions AG also entered into the Reverse Global Services Agreement dated
January 1, 2021 (the ‘‘RGSA’’) covering, on a short-term basis, transitional services that we will be
providing to Lonza Group, mostly in the area of facility use at some of our sites.

The duration that we will provide these services under the RGSA varies by service line, up to a maximum
of 24 months for some service lines (an initial term of 12 months, plus a potential extension of 12 months),
save in relation to transitional logistics and warehousing at our Kouˇrim site, which will be provided for an
initial term of 48 months and then continue until terminated.

_Site Services Agreements_

**_Visp_**

Following the Acquisition, manufacturing assets in Visp will remain with us, however Lonza Group will
continue providing certain site services and in connection with the building rights described in ‘‘—Real
_Estate’’ below, as well as energy and utilities that are vital for production under the Site Service Agreement_
between Lonza Ltd and Lonza Solutions AG dated January 1, 2021 (the ‘‘Visp Site Services Agreement’’).
The Visp site will continue to have shared infrastructure (see ‘‘—Manufacturing—Key Manufacturing
_Sites—Visp’’). The Visp Site Services Agreement covers the following key areas, under which we and Lonza_
Group provide services to one another:

- site services: administrative activities, EHS, facility management, general site maintenance, training,
workshops, quality control and lab services and logistics and supply chain management; and

- utilities: electricity, steam, natural gas, water, solvent recovery and waste management.

The Visp Site Services Agreement has been entered for an unlimited period; provided, however that certain
Non-Mandatory Services (as defined therein) set forth therein may be terminated on twelve months’
notice, and certain Mandatory Services set forth therein may be terminated on 60 months’ notice. None of
the Mandatory Services (as defined therein) may be terminated by Lonza without cause prior to
December 31, 2040.

**_Nansha_**

Following the Acquisition, Lonza’s Nansha site in the People’s Republic of China will remain with Lonza
Group. However it will continue manufacturing Vitamin B3 and certain other products for us (see
‘‘—Supply and Tolling Agreements’’). In addition, some of our non-production employees (such as
administration services and procurement teams) will remain on the site. Lonza Group will provide certain
site services (such as procurement, administration services and EHS) to support these teams under the Site
Service Agreement between Guangzhou Nansha LONZA LTD, Lonza (China) Investments Co., Ltd. and
YOU SOLUTIONS Guangzhou LTD dated January 1, 2021. (the ‘‘Nansha Site Services Agreement’’). The
services provided under the Nansha Site Services Agreement have a duration of 49 months, which includes
an initial term of 25 months for each service line, extendable twice up to 12 months for each extension.

164


-----

_Supply and Tolling Agreements_

We entered into 11 supply and tolling agreements with Lonza Group between June 1, 2020 and January 1,
2021 (the ‘‘Supply and Tolling Agreements’’). Pursuant to the Supply and Tolling Agreements, we will
supply certain goods to Lonza Group from the Visp site (such as pharma intermediates and certain basic
chemicals) and Lonza Group will continue supplying goods to us from its Nansha site (Vitamin B3 and
Lonzagard BKC) and its Cohasset site (Laracare). In addition, we will continue providing certain tolling
services to Lonza Group’s operations at the Visp site (to pharma intermediates) and globally (Carniking in
Kouˇrim) and Lonza Group will continue providing certain tolling services to our operations at the Visp site
(Iodosulforon) and Nansha site (Glydant and formulation).

These agreements will be effective for initial terms of four years from their commencement dates, followed
by automatic renewals until terminated, with three exceptions: (i) two of the Supply and Tolling
Agreements from Lonza Group to LSI expire on September 30, 2021 (in each case subject to a possible
three month extension); and (ii) one Supply and Tolling Agreement from Lonza Group to LSI has a fixed
term of five years, expiring on October 31, 2025, with the right for LSI to (a) terminate after three years
and (b) extend for a further five years.

_Real Estate_

In connection with the Carve-Out, Lonza, as landowner of properties in Visp and Lalden, Switzerland,
granted to us certain independent building rights on parts of these properties for a period of 100 years.
These building rights allow us to operate our facilities in Visp, including plants, offices, streets, railways
and pipes.

Lonza will provide short- to long-term leases in relation to other sites, including shared office space, Basel
Tower and facilities in Morristown and Nansha.

_Material Financing Arrangements_

See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

**Legal Proceedings**

We may from time to time become involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of
our business. Most of such claims and lawsuits generally relate to allegations of personal injury associated
with Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA), which is a wood preservative, and wood warranty claims filed
under Arch Treatment Technologies’ residential wood limited warranties.

We are not currently involved in any material legal, governmental or arbitration proceedings which could,
individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition,
and, we are not aware of any material governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such
proceedings which are pending or threatened of which we are aware), during the past three years, which
may have, or have had in the recent past, adverse effects on our financial position or profitability. The
outcome of legal proceedings, however, can be extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we can
offer no assurances in this regard.

**REGULATION**

_As a chemical manufacturer, our activities and the sale of our products are subject to numerous regulations,_
_including those described briefly and non-exhaustively below. Prospective investors and/or their advisers should_
_make their own full analysis of the legislation and regulations which apply in all countries where we operate and_
_of the impact they may have on an investment in the Notes and should not rely exclusively on the content of the_
_following paragraphs._

**Overview**

Our business is highly regulated in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our production facilities
and operations are subject to both national and international regulatory regimes. In the Member States
and the UK, the regulatory environment of our business activities is shaped by EU directives and
regulations, which are either implemented through national legislation or, in the case of Member States,
have direct application to the states or individuals. In the United States, the regulatory environment is
shaped by federal and state laws and regulations. Regulations that affect our operations mostly relate to
areas of environmental protection, product safety and quality, occupational health and safety, industrial
hygiene and plant safety.

EHS laws and regulations govern our facilities and our operations, including: (i) the storage, handling,
treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste; (ii) water intake and sewage discharges; (iii) air
emissions (including greenhouse gas (‘‘GHG’’) emissions); (iv) human health and safety; (v) the clean-up
and remediation of contaminated sites; and (vi) the sale and use of the products we manufacture. Many of
our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution. We have incurred, and will
continue to incur, on-going capital and operating expenditures to ensure compliance with current and
future EHS laws and regulations, which tend to become more stringent over time, including more stringent
enforcement of these laws and regulations. Our EHS management systems are intended to ensure that we
both comply with applicable EHS requirements and minimize EHS risk by promoting EHS protection
activities and initiatives. We actively address legal compliance issues in connection with our operations and
properties, and we believe that we have systems in place to ensure that EHS costs and liabilities will not
have a material adverse impact on us. Nevertheless, estimates of future EHS costs and liabilities are
inherently imprecise, and the imposition of new or unanticipated EHS costs or obligations could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**EU and UK Regulations**

**Industry and Product Related Regulations**

_Chemicals Regulations—REACH and CLP_

The use, manufacture and importing of chemicals is regulated in the European Union through
Regulation 1907/2006 concerning REACH, which has been in force on June 1, 2007, and requires that
chemical substances or preparations manufactured, imported or otherwise placed within the European
Union in quantities exceeding one ton per year, be registered by manufacturers and importers with the
European Chemicals Agency (the ‘‘ECHA’’). REACH, as amended, imposes significant obligations on the
chemicals industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of
building block and semi-specialty chemicals. Full registration requires the provision of comprehensive data
on the identification, properties, uses, classification and labeling of the relevant substance and exposure
scenarios.

Manufacturers and importers of substances in the European Union must obtain information on the
substances they manufacture or import to assess the risks arising from their use and to ensure that risks are
properly managed. For the use or sale of substances deemed particularly hazardous and specified in
Annex XIV of the REACH Regulation, an authorization will be required. The manufacture and placing on
the market of certain dangerous substances in the European Union is also restricted by REACH.

Following the end of the transition period for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU from January 1, 2021, the
EU REACH Regulation has been brought into UK law under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(save for Northern Ireland, with the EU REACH regime continues to apply). REACH, and related
legislation, have been replicated in the UK with the necessary changes to make it operable in the UK with
the key principles of EU REACH retained. The new domestic regime is known as UK REACH. UK-based
companies can continue to rely on existing EU REACH registrations by completing the ‘grandfathering’

166


-----

process by providing basic information to the UK Health and Safety Executive by April 30, 2021. For cross
EU-UK trade of chemicals, registration requirements of each regime must be met.

REACH works in connection with the CLP Regulation (1272/2008/EC, as amended) to regulate and
standardize the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures in the EU, and imposes
obligations on manufacturers, importers, downstream users and distributors of certain substances,
depending on their role in this supply chain. CLP has also been brought into UK law under the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (save for Northern Ireland, with the EU CLP Regulation applies).

_Biocides and cosmetics—BPR and Cosmetics Directive_

The BPR establishes a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and
products, which in some instances requires developing new safety data and compiling new and existing data
into dossiers to be assessed by the regulatory authorities. Manufacturers work alone and with industry
groups to manage these data requirements and meet relevant deadlines of the program by the submission
of dossiers for active substances. Registration costs, which are incurred through a multi-year period, can be
significant.

The BPR has been brought into UK law under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (save for
Northern Ireland, with the EU BPR regime continues to apply), pursuant to the Chemicals (Health and
Safety) and Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2019, as amended in 2020. Existing biocidal product authorizations that were valid in the UK
under the EU BPR at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 will remain valid until their
normal expiry date, provided the authorization holder is established in the UK (including Northern
Ireland) by 1 January 2022. Safety data previously provided to the ECHA will need to be provided to the
UK regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, by 1 January 2023. For cross EU-UK trade of biocides, the
requirements of each regime must be met.

The Cosmetics Regulation (EC 1223/2009) regulates the manufacturer and placing on the market of
cosmetic products, imposing a range of compliance obligations, including the preparation of a product
safety report prior to placing a product on the market and notification of products via the EU Cosmetic
Products Notification Portal (‘‘CPNP’’). Lists of substances prohibited or restricted in cosmetic products
are maintained under the regime, as assessed by the EU Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety
(‘‘SCSS’’). Restrictions can be changed over time depending on the evidence available, and this can affect
the ability to manufacture and market certain substances. The Cosmetics Regulation applies to
antidandruff ingredients and claims, including the antidandruff ingredient zinc pyrithione (‘‘ZPT’’) which
we manufacture. The SCSS issued an opinion in March 2020 finding that ZPT is considered safe when
used at a concentration up to 1.0% as an antidandruff agent in rinse-off hair care products, however, the
EU has since notified a draft regulation to the World Trade Organization which seeks to characterize ZPT
a category 1B carcinogen, and proposes to prohibit for use in cosmetic products on the EU market from
March 2022. The proposal remains outstanding, but could prevent sales in the EU of products which
contain this ingredient which we manufacture.

Laws giving effect to the Cosmetics Regulation have been brought into UK law under the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (save for Northern Ireland, where EU laws apply to products). The UK
government is not bound to follow the ban of ZPT but is entitled to do so.

_Plan protection products_

Our agricultural products are subject to laws regulating the manufacture, supply and the use of plant
protection products (‘‘PPP’’) in the EU, primarily Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 on the placing on the
market of plant protection products, alongside the CLP and related regulations on the sustainable use of
pesticides. The regime requires that an active substance (any chemical, plant extract or micro-organism
that acts against pests or on plants) in a PPP is approved by a competent national authority in an EU
country before it is placed on the market, and there is a mutual recognition regime enabling requests to
use approvals in other EU countries. Applicants are required to provide the necessary scientific
information to support an assessment as to whether the product has any harmful effects on human health,
including vulnerable groups, or any unacceptable effect on the environment. Authorities may attach
criteria and restrictions when approving a PPP. Approvals were first granted for a periods not exceeding
10 years, and require renewal.

167


-----

The EU PPP regime has been adopted into UK law pursuant to a series of instruments, including the
Pesticides and Fertilisers (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Plant
Protective Products (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, with certain transitional
provisions (and excluding Northern Ireland where the EU PPP regime still applies). The Health and Safety
Executive continues to be the UK’s national competent authority. Existing active substance approvals and
other authorizations will continue to be valid in the UK until their current expiry date though approvals
due to expire before December 2023 will be extended for three years. The mutual recognition regime no
longer allows UK approvals to be used as a basis for new EU country approvals under the EU PPP, and
vice versa.

**Environment, Health and Safety Regulations**

Our manufacturing sites in Europe and the UK are subject to significant regulation regarding the
operation of chemical plants. Regulation of environmental and health and safety issues is considerable,
including but not limited to waste prevention and control, fire safety, protection against explosive hazards,
storage, transport and use of hazardous substances, air emissions, wastewater management, environmental
liability, integrated permitting, noise and groundwater protection. There are a number of regimes which
impose requirements on operators to obtain permits and licenses for certain activities. EU Directives and
Regulations set common EU-wide standards of operation in several areas, that, in some cases, may be
made stricter by Member States’ authorities. Other areas of law, especially contaminated land regulations,
are largely a matter of domestic Member State law, with limited EU-wide harmonization, regarding permit
granting procedures or enforcement (by way of example, the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU)).
Fines and penalties for non-compliance with environmental and health and safety issues vary across
Member States and the UK, but most impose a penalty in relation to such non-compliance.

Following the end of the transition period for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU from January 1, 2021,
environmental and health and safety laws (including those detailed below) were brought into UK law
under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, with necessary changes to make them operable in the
UK with the key principles of EU law retained. These laws may be amended by the UK government in
coming years, and the regimes may diverge.

Examples of the key directives (which are implemented by national laws) and regimes applicable to our
businesses and facilities in Europe and the UK include, but are not limited to, the following:

_Industrial Emissions Directive_

The Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU, as amended) (the ‘‘IED’’), in force from January 6, 2011,
regulates a wide range of industrial installations which operate above certain thresholds in a variety of
industry sectors, including the chemicals industry. The IED’s aims are to prevent or reduce emissions from
industrial installations to air, land and water. It requires, among other things, that installations which fall
within its scope to operate under a permit and such permits are to be conditional on ‘‘BAT conclusions’’.
Best Available Techniques (‘‘BAT’’) conclusions are documents which set out what constitutes the BAT for
a particular activity, including emissions levels, monitoring and remediation. When an installation is closed
the IED also requires that permitting authorities must ensure that steps are taken to avoid any pollution
caused by the closure of the site and that measures are taken to return the site to a satisfactory state. The
IED provides, inter alia, that operators of sites which use hazardous substances prepare a baseline report
setting out information that will enable the state of contamination of soil and ground water at the site to be
compared when the site is closed.

_Safety and Health of Workers at Work Directive_

Directive 89/391/EEC, as amended, on measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of
workers (the ‘‘HSW Directive’’) aims to eliminate the risk factors for occupational diseases and accidents
by establishing rules for protecting the health and safety of workers. It imposes duties on employers to
ensure the workers’ health and safety in every aspect of their work, including if they enlist external
companies or persons, based on a system of adaptable risk prevention and management, the provision of
information to workers, common protective measures and training, and the provision of the necessary
organization and means for the protection of workers.

168


-----

_Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances_

Directive 2012/18/EU, as amended, (and its predecessors) relating to the prevention and management of
incidents in relation to the use, manufacture and storage of hazardous substances (the ‘‘SEVESO III
**Directive’’) aims to prevent major accident hazards involving dangerous substances and to limit the**
consequences of any such accidents if they do occur. It applies to establishments in which certain quantities
of dangerous substances are present (stored, used or manufactured). Operators of such establishments are
required to take all necessary measures to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences on human
health and the environment, including in some cases establishing, obtaining approval for and testing safety
and emergency plans and policies.

_Fire Security and Explosion Hazard Rules_

Minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from
explosive atmospheres are imposed by two Directives. Directive 2014/34/EU, as amended, applies to
equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres (‘‘ATEX 114’’),
and Directive 1999/92/EC, as amended, applies to workplaces (‘‘ATEX 137’’).

_Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Emissions Trading Rules_

The EU ETS (Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended) establishes a scheme for GHG emission allowance
trading within the Community (the ‘‘EU ETS Directive’’). It covers many installations in the chemicals
sector, including as a result of operating large combustion installations (20MW or over) such as boiler
houses and generators, the releases of carbon dioxide from the production of bulk organic chemicals, and
releases of nitrous oxide from the production of nitric, adipic, glyoxal and glyoxylic acid. The EU ETS
Directive is split into phases, and we are currently in Phase IV. Operators of installations subject to the EU
ETS Directive are required to monitor all emissions of carbon dioxide from their installation and to
surrender, on an annual basis, allowances in an amount equal to their emissions at these installations.

Free allowances have been provided to operators in accordance with a methodology which decreases over
time, reducing to zero in 2027. In the event of a shortfall in allowances until 2027, and for all allowances
from 2027, we will have to purchase a sufficient number of allowances to make up the deficit. Allowances
have a market price which, at present, is regarded as being low. However, further proposed reforms to the
European carbon market are being contemplated with a view to reducing the supply of allowances.

The EU has set an overall environmental target to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030 as part
of its contribution to the Paris Agreement. Current and future EU ETS phases are designed to help
achieve these targets. It is possible that the carbon price will increase over time and, consequently, the
costs of meeting any shortfall for complying with the EU ETS regime could materially increase. It is also
likely that laws which aim to reduce the European Union’s carbon footprint in the areas of energy
efficiency, carbon dioxide emissions allowances trading, renewable energy requirements and construction
requirements for the energy efficiency of buildings will be introduced and strengthened. Compliance with
current or future GHG regulations governing our operations, including those discussed above, may result
in significantly increased capital expenditures for measures such as capital expenditures to install more
environmentally efficient technology or the purchase of allowances to emit carbon dioxide or other GHG.

_Waste Framework Directives_

Our European business is subject to a wide range of waste laws. The Waste Framework Directive
(2008/98/EC, as amended) (the ‘‘WFD’’), as amended, aims to protect the environment and human health
through the prevention of the harmful effects of waste generation and management. It imposes
requirements for the treatment of waste in line with the waste hierarchy which prioritizes how waste should
be managed: prevention; preparing for reuse; recycling; other recovery, notably energy recovery; and
disposal. In accordance with the ‘‘polluter pays’’ principle, the costs of waste management are to be borne
by the original waste producer or by the current or previous waste holders. Any producer or holder of
waste is required to carry out its own waste treatment or have treatment carried out by another
establishment. Hazardous waste is prohibited from being mixed, requires appropriate labeling and
packaging, and also requires storage and treatment in conditions that ensure the protection of health and
the environment.

169


-----

**U.S. Environmental Regulations**

The following is a summary of some of the various U.S. products and EHS regulations that we believe have
a material impact on our business:

**FIFRA**

In the United States, biocide products are regulated under FIFRA, as amended by the Food Quality
Protection Act of 1996, as ‘‘pesticides’’ or ‘‘antimicrobial pesticides.’’ FIFRA is the principal federal statute
governing the manufacture, labelling, handling and use of pesticides. The LSI Companies maintain several
hundred product registrations with the EPA. Registration requires compliance with certain efficacy,
toxicity and labelling requirements and the on-going payment of registration fees. Each state in which
these products are sold also requires registration and following maintenance of product life cycle with
payment of fees for initial registration, change of labelling and registration discontinuance. In general,
states impose substantively similar requirements to those required by FIFRA. However, California and
certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California impose a tax on total
pesticide sales in that state.

**Toxic Substances Control Act and Green Chemistry Initiatives**

The TSCA imposes requirements on persons and companies that manufacture, process, distribute, use or
dispose ‘‘chemical substances’’ as defined. Among other things, under TSCA the EPA has the authority to:
(i) require testing of chemicals; (ii) undertake pre-market review and impose restrictions upon new
chemicals; (iii) limit or prohibit the manufacture, use, distribution and disposal of chemical substances;
(iv) impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements; and (v) regulate the export and import of chemical
substances.

TSCA was updated in 2016 by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which
expanded the scope of the EPA’s regulation of existing and new chemical substances. These TSCA
amendments impact testing and analysis of risks, and EPA evaluation costs, for chemical substances in the
United States and provide the EPA with additional tools to manage chemicals of concern. TSCA requires
premarket approval prior to the manufacture in, or import to, the U.S. of new chemical substances.

The EPA may impose civil and criminal liability for TSCA violations.

In addition, numerous state and local governmental authorities and industry groups have implemented or
are considering so-called ‘‘green chemistry’’ or similar chemical-focused initiatives to identify, prioritize,
and restrict the use of existing hazardous chemicals with the goal of preventing pollution before it occurs.
These or other similar future changes to chemicals regulation and best practices in the U.S. could place
additional regulatory burdens on the industry.

**Clean Air Act**

The Clean Air Act (‘‘CAA’’) and its implementing regulations, as well as similar state laws and regulations
governing emissions of pollutants into the air, impose permitting and emission control requirements.
Standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA may require that we install controls at or make operational
changes to our facilities. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be significant.
In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations could
result in substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions.

The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain permits for the construction,
modification, and operation of our equipment, comply with permit requirements, and incur capital
expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our facilities. Capital
expenditures may be required to maintain compliance with these and other air emission regulations in the
future.

**Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Rules**

Regulation of GHGs in the United States is currently subject to complicated domestic and international
political, policy and economic dynamics.

Our operations result in emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide, and our operations are energyintensive and require the purchase or electricity, the generation of which often results in emissions of
GHGs.

170


-----

Future regulation of GHGs in the United States could occur pursuant to future international treaty
obligations, regulatory changes under the CAA or other existing legislation, or federal, state or regional
adoption of GHG regulatory schemes. This could cause us to incur additional costs in complying with any
new regulations, which may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.

**Management of Hazardous Substances and Contamination**

The present-day generation, handling, and disposal of solid wastes, including certain regulated hazardous
waste, is regulated by the EPA and states pursuant to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(‘‘RCRA’’) and state-specific regulatory programs. These regulations cover the generation, storage,
transportation, and disposal of solid wastes. Persons may be held liable for cleanup at sites where the past
or present storage, handling, treatment, transport, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present
an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment and at sites where hazardous
waste treatment, storage or disposal operations are subject to permitting requirements and have resulted in
contamination.

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (‘‘CERCLA’’) and
analogous state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where a release or threatened release of
‘‘hazardous substances’’ (including regulated hazardous waste and also other categories of substances and
wastes, but not including petroleum) has occurred or is threatened. These persons can include the current
owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or
operated the property when disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the
transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property.

Liability for petroleum contamination, such as contamination from leaking petroleum underground tanks,
is primarily governed state law. Liable parties typically include the property owner and/or operator, and
any other parties in control of the petroleum at the time of the release or discharge.

We are liable for and have related environmental reserves for contamination at certain U.S. sites under
RCRA, CERCLA, similar state laws, and under state petroleum liability schemes, and we could have
additional liability at these contaminated sites and perhaps others in the future.

**Process Safety and Prevention of Major Accidents**

We are subject to OSHA and similar state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of
employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and
Community Right to Know Act (‘‘EPCRA’’) and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and
regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our
operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and
citizens.

Certain manufacturing facilities are also subject to the EPA’s CAA Risk Management Program (‘‘RMP’’),
which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly hazardous
chemicals to develop a risk management plan and program in the event of an accidental release of such
chemicals.

**Clean Water Act**

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and subsequent amendments, commonly
referred to as the Clean Water Act (‘‘CWA’’), and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict
controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants
into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a CWA permit. The CWA also
requires many facilities to develop and maintain plans for preventing and responding to spills of pollutants
(including oil), called Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans, and certain higher-risk facilities
that store and handle pollutants are required to prepare and maintain a more extensive plan called a
Facility Response Plan. Breaches of the CWA can result in administrative, civil or criminal sanctions.

**FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements and FFDCA**

Various federal laws have been enacted and are administered under regulatory programs implemented by
several federal agencies that regulate certain products we manufacture and sell for controlling microbial
growth on humans, including antibacterial soaps and rubs. In the United States, these requirements
generally are administered by the FDA including via the ‘‘OTC [over-the-counter] Monograph process.’’

171


-----

The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety and
effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including
proposing additional requirements for data necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of
over-the-counter antiseptic drug products.

Some of the ingredients we produce for the formulation of cosmetics and personal care products are also
regulated under the FDA’s implementation of FFDCA requirements, which authorize the FDA to regulate
cosmetic products and their ingredients. The statutory provisions of the FFDCA that address cosmetics
include adulteration and misbranding provisions, including for example, anti-dandruff claims.
Anti-dandruff ingredients are also regulated pursuant to the OTC Monograph process and must conform
to the product and labelling standards set out in the applicable FDA regulations and must be
manufactured in accordance with cGMPs.

On March 27, 2020, the US Congress enacted the ‘‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act’’
(‘‘CARES Act’’), which included OTC monograph reform provisions. The OTC provisions change how FDA
regulates drugs marketed under a monograph and further strengthen FDA oversight on OTC products’
safety, quality and efficacy.

**Switzerland**

**_Regulation of Chemical Products in General_**

In Switzerland, chemical products are subject to a comprehensive set of regulations, including the Swiss
Act on Protection against Dangerous Substances and Preparations (‘‘Chemicals Act’’) (Chemikaliengesetz).
The Chemicals Act is supplemented by implementing ordinances, namely the Ordinance on Protection
against Dangerous Substances and Preparations (‘‘Chemicals Ordinance’’) (Chemikalienverordnung), and
the Ordinance on the Reduction of Risks relating to the Use of Certain Particularly Dangerous
Substances, Preparations and Articles (‘‘Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance’’) (Chemikalien_Risikoreduktions-Verordnung). In addition, the Chemicals Act is supplemented with separate product-_
specific ordinances, such as the ordinance on biocidal products (see ‘‘—Regulation of Biocidal Products’’) or
the ordinance on plant protection products (Pflanzenschutzmittelverordnung).

In order to minimize technical trade barriers, the Swiss legislature and government have largely
harmonized the Swiss regulations on chemical products with those that apply in the European Union (see
‘‘—EU and UK Regulations’’ above). In particular, Switzerland has autonomously adopted parts of the
European REACH Regulation (including modifications up to and including those set out in Regulation
(EU) 2017/706), the CLP Regulation (up to and including the 15[th] adaptations to technical progress (ATP)
as set out in Regulation (EU) 2020/1182), the candidate list of so-called ‘‘substances of very high concern’’
(SVHC) of the European Chemicals Agency as last modified by the decision ECHA ED/71/2020 as well as
the European Biocidal Product Regulation (Regulation (EU) 528/2012; see ‘‘—Regulation of Biocidal
_Products’’). Additionally, Swiss legislation takes into account the recommendations of the OECD on test_
methods and good laboratory practice as well as the United Nations recommendations for classifying and
labelling of chemicals. An overview of the status of the harmonization of Swiss chemicals legislation with
international regulations, including a list of ongoing legislative projects to further harmonize Swiss
regulations with European regulations, is available online at: <https://www.anmeldestelle.admin.ch/chem/
en/home/themen/recht-wegleitungen/stand-der-harmonisierung-mit-internationalen-vorschriften.html>.

The Chemicals Act sets out rules and principles for the handling of chemical substances and preparations.
The general principle under the Chemicals Act is self-regulation and self-control, meaning that a
manufacturer who places substances or preparations on the market is responsible for ensuring that such
substances or preparations do not endanger life or health. Subject to certain exceptions (in particular with
respect to new substances or biocidal products see ‘‘—Regulation of Biocidal Products’’), the completion of
the self-regulation and self-control procedures allows a manufacturer to place substances and preparations
on the market without prior authorization by or notification to the Swiss authorities.

The Chemicals Ordinance governs, among other things, the classification, packaging and labelling of
substances and preparations as well as preparation of exposure scenarios and compilation of safety data
sheets. As discussed above, these regulations of the Chemicals Ordinance closely follow those regulations
of the European Union, in particular the REACH and CLP Regulations. The Chemicals Ordinance also
sets out the procedure for notification and communication of new substances as well as post-marketing
obligations of the manufacturer. For example, manufacturers are required to reassess or further assess

172


-----

substances, preparations and objects containing dangerous constituents and, where necessary, reclassify,
relabel and repackage them under certain circumstances (e.g., if they are to be used in a different way).

The Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance prohibits or restricts the use of particularly dangerous
substances, preparations and objects (as set out in the annexes to the ordinance) and specifies the personal
and professional qualifications required for the use of certain particularly dangerous substances,
preparations and articles.

Non-compliance with the Swiss legislations and implementing ordinance may result in criminal liability.

**_Regulation of Biocidal Products_**

Biocidal products may only be placed on the market, sold or used in a professional or commercial capacity,
if such products have been authorized, notified or recognized in accordance with the Swiss Ordinance on
Biocidal Products (‘‘Biocidal Products Ordinance’’) (Biozidprodukteverordnung). The authorization has to
be obtained from the Swiss Common Notification Authority for Chemicals (Gemeinsame Anmeldestelle
_Chemikalien). As is the case with regulations of chemical products in general, the Swiss product-specific_
regulation on biocidal products closely follows European regulations, in particular the European Biocidal
Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) 528/2012) (see ‘‘—EU and UK Regulations—Industry and Product
_Related Regulations—Biocides and cosmetics—BPR and Cosmetics Directive’’). More specifically, the_
Biocidal Products Ordinance represents the Swiss autonomous adaptation of the European Biocidal
Products Regulation (as last modified by Regulation (EU) 334/2014), and Switzerland has also
autonomously adapted European implementing acts up to and including Commission Implementing
Regulation (EU) 2016/1802. These implementing acts are set out in the Swiss Implementing Ordinance on
Biocidal Products of the Federal Department of Home Affairs. In particular, Switzerland has adopted the
assessment procedures for biocidal active substances from the European Union, and Switzerland is actively
integrated in the European assessment process of biocidal substances. Biocidal products with active
substances that are not yet fully approved in the European Union (i.e. active substances that are notified
only) require a separate authorization in Switzerland. Conversely, biocidal products that contain only
already approved active substances and that are approved in the European Union can be approved in
parallel also in Switzerland. In addition, the European Union authorization for biocidal products under the
European Biocidal Products Regulation also extends to Switzerland.

Similar to the general regulations applicable to chemical products (see ‘‘—Regulation of Chemical
_Products’’), the Swiss rules and regulation on biocidal products provide for rules on the packaging and the_
labelling of biocidal products as well as the advertisement for such products. For example, the label used
on packaging of biocidal products must not be misleading in respect of the risks from the biocidal product
to human health, animal health or the environment or its efficacy. Additionally, the label must indicate,
among other things, active substances used in a product, the authorization number, the authorized uses
and directions for use, likely side effects and instructions for first aid, references to accompanying
instruction notes, and instructions on the safe disposal of the product and the packaging.

Non-compliance with the rules of the Swiss Ordinance on Biocidal Products may result in criminal liability
under the rules of the Chemicals Act.

**_Regulation of Plant Protection Products_**

Plant protection products are subject to product-specific rules under the Swiss Ordinance on Placing Plant
Protection Products on the Market (‘‘Plant **Protection** **Products** **Ordinance’’)**
(Pflanzenschutzmittelverordnung). The Plant Protection Products Ordinance aims to ensure that plant
protection products are sufficiently suitable and do not cause unacceptable side effects on human, animal,
and the environment when used properly. Moreover, the Plant Protection Products Ordinance’s purpose is
to ensure a high level of protection for human and animal health as well as the environment. Moreover,
the rules of the Plant Protection Products Ordinance also aims to improve agricultural production. More
specifically, the Plant Protection Products Ordinance sets out rules relating to the marketing, (i) the
approval of ingredients used in plant protection products, (ii) the placing on the market (which requires
prior approval of the relevant product), and (iii) the control of plant protection products. Approval
authority for plant protection products is the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture (Bundesamt f¨ur
_Landwirtschaft, BLW)._

173

**_Other Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations affecting our Operations in Switzerland_**

Our Swiss operations, in particular our manufacturing site in Visp, are subject to a comprehensive set of
regulations (federal, cantonal and local level) relating to environmental, health and safety (including
workplace safety). Relevant regulations include the Swiss Act on the Protection of the Environment
(Umweltschutzgesetz), the Swiss Ordinance on Air Pollution Control (Luftreinhalteverordnung), the Swiss
Ordinance on Noise Abatement Ordinance (L¨armschutzverordnung), and the Swiss Ordinance for Waste
Processing (Verordnung ¨uber den Verkehr mit Abf¨allen). These rules are relevant for our manufacturing site
in Visp, as they govern, among other things, emissions of substances to the air (e.g., emission of hydrogen
cyanide or nitrous oxide), noise and odor emissions (including required technical measures to reduce
noise), and wastewater management (in particular requirements to implement additional installations for
the treatment of wastewater discharge).

In addition, Swiss law provides for rules relating to the remediation of environmental issues such as use of
asbestos in buildings or environmental pollution (in particular contamination of soil or groundwater from
leaked substances). Compliance with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur additional costs
(e.g., for additional installations or safety measures), which may adversely affect our operations and
financial condition. Non-compliance with Swiss environmental laws and regulations or governmentally
imposed remediation measures may lead to civil liability, administrative action by competent government
authorities and/or criminal liability.

two members. Set forth below are the names and respective ages of each member of LSI senior
management.

**Name** **Age** **Position**

Antje Gerber . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 54 Chief Operating Officer and Head of Business
Unit, Specialty Chemical Services
Ib Jensen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 57 Head of Finance and IT

Set forth below is a short biography of each of the above members of the senior management.

_Antje Gerber has been Chief Operating Officer of LSI since summer 2020 and head of Specialty Chemical_
Services since 2019. She was previously Vice President, Managing Director and Executive Officer at
Venator Materials (formerly Huntsman Pigments). She spent seven years at HB Fuller in various leading
positions, including MD of Germany, integration and transformation lead following the acquisition of
Forbo adhesives, P&L, BD and Marketing lead EIMEA; 14 years at Evonik in senior P&L, Innovation and
Business Development roles. She started her career in sales at Helm and later Roquette.

_Ib Jensen joined Lonza as Head of Finance & IT in 2019. He was previously with Syngenta as Head of_

L&G and Global Head of Merger Integration.

**Conflicts of Interest**

There are no conflicts of interest between the duties to the Issuers or the Guarantors of the directors and
the senior management team listed above, and their private interests and other duties.

**Compensation for Directors and Managers**

Compensation offered to our key management consists of a fixed salary, post-employment benefits and
other benefits and share-based payments.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, the LSI Business was not a legal group for consolidated reporting
statement purposes in accordance with IFRS 10. The LSI Business was controlled by Lonza Group.
Therefore, the board of directors and executive committee of Lonza Group Ltd were deemed key
management for the purposes of calculating compensation and benefits attributable to key management.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the aggregate remuneration of key management of Lonza Group
allocated to the LSI Business, which includes individuals not identified above, was CHF5 million. See
Note 21.2 to our 2020 Financial Statements.

**Share Ownership**

Following the Acquisition, LSI will be controlled by Bain and the Cinven Funds. See ‘‘Principal
_Shareholders.’’_

176


-----

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we enter into related party transactions with our
shareholders, key management personnel and associates. We have also historically entered into
transactions with companies within the Lonza Group that were considered related party transactions at the
time of such transactions. We believe that all transactions with such parties are negotiated and executed on
an arm’s-length basis and that the terms of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted
with unrelated third-parties. See ‘‘Business—Material Agreements—Post-Acquisition Agreements with
_Lonza’’ and Note 21 to the 2020 Financial Statements and the 2019 Financial Statements._

In addition, we will engage in various financing transactions with our new shareholders and enter into new
related party transactions in connection with the Transactions.

**Management Incentive Program**

We intend to establish a management incentive program to which certain of our managers will be able to
subscribe to after the Acquisition Closing Date through an indirect holding company of the LSI Business
and for which the relevant managers will be expected to enter into certain customary documentation.

over-funding).

**_Availability_**

Facility B will be available to be utilized from (and including) the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement
to (and including) 11.59pm (London time) on the earliest to occur of (i) the first date on which both the
(a) Acquisition Closing Date has occurred and (b) the first utilization of Facility B has been made (the
‘‘Closing Date’’), (ii) March 1, 2022, and (iii) the date on which the SSN Issuer determines and notifies the
agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement in writing that the Acquisition Agreement has been validly
and conclusively terminated prior to the Acquisition Closing Date in accordance with its terms (and no
new, amended or replacement Acquisition Agreement is entered into within 10 business days and
delivered as a condition precedent to the making of a utilization on the same basis as the original
Acquisition Agreement), or, in each case, such later date as agreed by the Arrangers holding (with their
affiliates) more than 50% of the aggregate commitments in the Senior Secured Facilities (acting reasonably
and in good faith).

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the date of the Senior Facilities
Agreement to (and including) the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

Utilizations of the Original Senior Credit Facilities are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Original Senior Credit Facilities will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to the
applicable floating rate (being the applicable EURIBOR for loans in Euro, LIBOR for loans in USD and
certain other currencies (subject to mechanics to switch from LIBOR to risk free rates or other benchmark
rates in connection with the future discontinuation of LIBOR), SONIA plus a credit adjustment spread for
loans in Sterling, and other applicable rates for other currencies) plus an applicable margin, which in each
case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net
debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’)
(the ‘‘Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio’’).

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the
EUR TLB Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility (as applicable). If another interbank offered rate,
including LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the
Revolving Credit Facility or the USD TLB Facility (as applicable). Zero floors will also apply (i) to SONIA
(in respect of loans denominated in Sterling) and (ii) to the risk free rates or other benchmark rates
following the switch under the Senior Facilities Agreement of the floating rate applicable to a relevant
currency from LIBOR.

The interest margin applicable to each Original Senior Credit Facility will be subject to a capped
adjustment by reference to achievement against the Group’s sustainability KPI targets for the financial

180


-----

year ending 31 December 2022 and each subsequent financial year, as set out in the Framework, tested
annually by reference to the Group’s sustainability report in respect of the previous financial year, such
that the margin shall be reduced by a certain percentage where both KPI targets were met in the previous
financial year or increased by a certain percentage where neither of the KPI targets were met in the
previous financial year. Where only one of the KPI targets was met, the margin will not be adjusted. In the
event of any material acquisition the fair market value of which (as determined in good faith by the SSN
Issuer) exceeds 20% of the aggregated assets of the Senior Secured Group, the SSN Issuer will either (at
the SSN Issuer’s election, in respect of each such acquisition) (i) recalculate the applicable GHG emissions
intensity baseline level and the waste intensity baseline level to take into account the acquisition or
(ii) exclude the impact of such acquisition when reporting the KPIs for each financial year. Any
recalculation of the GHG emissions intensity baseline level and the waste intensity baseline level will be
reported in a sustainability report and verified by an external verifier.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving
Credit Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Such
commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears (provided that the SSN Issuer may elect that accrued
commitment fee shall instead be paid on each Quarter Date or the last date of each Interest Period
applicable to a Facility B), on the last day of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit
Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which the
relevant lender cancels its commitment.

A ticking fee will accrue in respect of the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled commitments in the EUR
TLB Facility and the USD TLB Facility allocated to investors in syndication, accruing from the date that
such commitments are allocated (the ‘‘Allocation Date’’) until the Closing Date. After an initial holiday
period after the Allocation Date, the ticking fee will accrue at rates equal to certain percentages of the
initial margin (excluding any LIBOR or EURIBOR floors) applicable to the relevant facility, varying by
reference to the number of calendar days elapsed since the Allocation Date.

Any letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be subject to such issuing bank and
fronting fees as may be agreed between the SSN Issuer and the applicable issuing bank and a letter of
credit fee equal to the margin that would have been applicable to a cash drawing under the Revolving
Credit Facility in the applicable currency.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional one per cent. per annum on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the EUR TLB Facility will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the
Closing Date.

The loans made under the USD TLB Facility will be repaid in instalments by repaying on each Quarter
Date (commencing, with respect to each Facility B (USD) Loan, with the last day of the first full Financial
Quarter ending after the utilization date in respect of the USD TLB Facility) an amount which reduces the
principal amount of such loans drawn during the availability period by 0.25 per cent of their outstanding
principal amount from time to time, with the balance to be repaid in full on the date that is seven years
from the Closing Date.

In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings subject to the satisfaction of certain
customary conditions. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the
termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility, being the date falling six and a half years from the
Closing Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be
reborrowed, subject to certain customary conditions.

In respect of the letters of credit, each will be repaid on the termination date of the relevant Revolving
Credit Facility, being the date falling six and a half years from the Closing Date (or such earlier date in
accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement), provided that if any letter of credit has an expiry date
ending on or after the termination date applicable to the applicable Revolving Credit Facility, on such
termination date each letter of credit shall be repaid unless the relevant issuing bank agrees that such letter
of credit shall continue as between that issuing bank and the relevant member of the Senior Secured
Group on a bilateral basis and not as part of or under the documentation for the Senior Secured Facilities.

**_Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to _de minimis_
amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the SSN Issuer and any of its restricted subsidiaries
(together the ‘‘Senior Secured Group’’) from certain asset disposals, to the extent not otherwise
applied for a permitted purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior Credit
Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount and other customary carve outs substantially similar to
the Notes as described in the section entitled ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’);

- unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the SSN Issuer
shall apply (in each case in such proportions as the SSN Issuer elects (in its sole discretion)) towards
the prepayment or cancellation (as applicable) of any or all of the term facilities (or any available
commitments in respect of any term loans), any other senior secured indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Group (or any available or undrawn commitments in respect of any senior secured
indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group) (or, if such prepayment would comply with the limitation
on restricted payments under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any other permitted indebtedness), for
each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing Date), a
percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold
amount (subject to certain adjustments based on anticipated debt service, distributions to be paid to
minority shareholders and certain other expenses, restricted payments, debt repayments, acquisitions,
investments, disposals, restructuring costs, group initiatives and capital expenditures in the relevant
financial years committed or designated to be undertaken in the next 24 months being deducted after
applying the applicable percentage(s)), which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio decreases (an ‘‘Excess Cash Flow Prepayment’’); and

- upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement which
follows terms substantially similar to the Notes as described in the section entitled ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes’’)), at the SSN Issuer’s option, unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders,_
either (i) each lender and issuing bank shall be entitled to require prepayment of outstanding amounts
and cancellation of its commitments within a prescribed time period or (ii) all outstanding undrawn
commitments of each lender shall be immediately cancelled and outstanding drawn commitments
shall become due and payable together with accrued interest and other amounts accrued or owing to
each lender. A change of control shall include: (i) any person or group of related persons (other than
one or more permitted holders) becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting
power of the voting stock of the SSN Issuer (other than in connection with a transaction or series of
transactions in which the SSN Issuer shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a Parent Entity (as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) so long as no person or group other than a permitted
holder, holds more than 50 per cent of the total voting power of the voting stock of such Parent
Entity); (ii) the SUN Issuer ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the SSN
Issuer (or any successor entity as a result of certain mergers permitted under the Senior Facilities
Agreement); or (iii) on a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of
merger, amalgamation, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of
related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Group taken as a
whole to a person, other than a restricted subsidiary or one or more permitted holders, in each case,
subject to certain exceptions.

The Revolving Credit Facility shall not be entitled to any mandatory prepayment proceeds (other than a
mandatory prepayment as a result of a Change of Control or illegality).

In the event that it becomes unlawful for any lender to perform its obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the borrower shall repay that lender’s participation in the utilizations made to that borrower
to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws on the last day of the interest period for each
utilization occurring after the agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement has notified the SSN Issuer (or
if earlier, the date specified by the lender in the illegality notice). Any available commitments of such
lender will be immediately reduced and cancelled to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws.

If a lender waives its right (such right shall be at the SSN Issuer’s request only) to receive its share of any
prepayment of the Senior Secured Facilities (‘‘Waived Amounts’’), such Waived Amounts may (at the SSN
Issuer’s option) be retained by the Senior Secured Group for any purposes not prohibited by the Senior
Facilities Agreement (including restricted payments), may be offered to any lender(s) selected by the SSN

182


-----

Issuer which did not decline such prepayment (apportioned between such lenders in the SSN Issuer’s sole
discretion, if applicable) or applied in prepayment of any other permitted indebtedness.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

_Guarantor Coverage Test and Material Subsidiaries_

The Senior Secured Facilities will be guaranteed by each borrower of the Senior Secured Facilities (the
‘‘Borrowers’’) and the Guarantors (together, the ‘‘Senior Secured Obligors’’).

Subject to agreed security principles in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the following security shall be
granted as a condition precedent to the availability of the Original Senior Credit Facilities: (a) the SUN
Issuer shall grant a limited recourse (i) share pledge in respect of its shares in the capital of the SSN Issuer
and (ii) pledge agreement in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the SUN Issuer
(as lender) by the SSN Issuer (as borrower); (b) the SSN Issuer shall grant (i) a share pledge in respect of
its shares in the capital of Swiss Holdco; (ii) a security agreement pledging certain structural intercompany
receivables owed to the SSN Issuer (as lender) by Swiss Holdco and UK Bidco (as borrowers); and (iii) a
bank account pledge agreement pledging its material bank accounts in Luxembourg (without control over
use and freely operational prior to acceleration); (c) Swiss Holdco shall grant a bank account pledge
agreement pledging its material bank accounts in Switzerland (without control over use and freely
operational prior to acceleration); (d) Swiss Midco shall grant a share pledge in respect of its shares in the
capital of US Holdco; (e) US Holdco shall grant a (i) share pledge in respect of its shares in the capital of
US Bidco and (ii) New York law all asset security (subject to customary exclusions); (f) US Bidco shall
grant New York law all asset security (subject to customary exclusions); and (g) UK Bidco shall grant an
English law debenture, granting security over its material bank accounts and a fixed charge over shares it
holds in other obligors incorporated in England and Wales and a floating charge over all of its assets
(subject to customary exclusions). Within 30 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date (and
subject to agreed security principles in the Senior Facilities Agreement) the obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement will be secured by: (i) a share pledge granted by Swiss Holdco over its shares in the
capital of Lonza Solutions AG and (ii) a security agreement granted by the SSN Issuer pledging any
structural intercompany receivables owed to the SSN Issuer (as lender) by Lonza Solutions AG. Within
150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the agreed security principles in the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be secured by (A) a
fixed charge over Lonza Solutions AG’s shares in the capital of UK Bidco and a pledge over its shares in
the capital of Swiss Midco and Lonza Services AG, (B) with respect to any Post-Closing Guarantors which
become borrowers under the Senior Facilities, security over the material bank accounts located in the
relevant Post-Closing Guarantors’ jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary exclusions, including
in respect of accounts that form part of a cash pooling arrangement (or similar or equivalent arrangement)
or that are used in conjunction with any factoring, securitization or other receivables financing
arrangement), (C) with respect to each Post-Closing Guarantor incorporated in the U.S. (Lonza, LLC and
Arch Personal Care Products, L.P.), security over substantially all of such Post-Closing Guarantor’s assets
(subject to customary exclusions, including no real estate security) and (D) with respect to each PostClosing Guarantor incorporated in England and Wales (Arch UK Biocides Limited), floating security over
substantially all of its assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary exclusions,
including no real estate security).

Subject to certain adjustments, exceptions and agreed security principles in the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the SSN Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Senior Secured Group incorporated
in a Guarantor Jurisdiction (i) that generate at least 80% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Senior Secured
Group within certain agreed jurisdictions (‘‘Guarantor Jurisdictions’’), namely, Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America (including any
state thereof and the District of Columbia), the jurisdiction of incorporation of any borrower (but only in
relation to that borrower) and any other jurisdiction agreed between the SSN Issuer and the lenders (the
‘‘Guarantor Coverage Test’’) and (ii) that are wholly owned and individually generate more than 5% of
Consolidated EBITDA of the Senior Secured Group (a ‘‘Material Subsidiary’’), in each case, are
guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement within 150 days of the Acquisition Closing Date and
thereafter on an ongoing basis within 120 days of the date on which the annual financial statements of the
SSN Issuer (or other applicable financial reporting entity) are required to be delivered to the agent under
the Senior Facilities Agreement.

183


-----

As part of the guarantor accession process, subject to the agreed security principles in the Senior Facilities
Agreement: (a) security shall be granted over the shares of such acceding guarantor to the extent its
shareholder is itself a guarantor; and (b) if the relevant acceding guarantor is incorporated in Australia,
Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the US or Singapore or any other jurisdiction
where floating security is customarily granted in connection with top tier acquisition financings (as
determined by the SSN Issuer acting reasonably), it shall grant all asset or floating security (as applicable
and subject to customary exclusions and ‘‘excluded assets’’ including real estate) and in each case only to
the extent to do so would not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant company to
conduct their business and operations (as determined by such company in its sole and absolute discretion).

_Release of Guarantees and Security_

In addition to the circumstances described below under ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreement—Distressed Disposals’’
and ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreement—Non-distressed Disposals,’’ the SSN Issuer may, subject to certain
conditions, request the release of a guarantor from its guarantee under the Senior Facilities Agreement if
(i) such guarantor is the subject of a third-party disposal or other permitted activity under the Senior
Facilities Agreement pursuant to which such guarantor will cease to be a member of the Senior Secured
Group, (ii) on a pro forma basis taking into account such release, the Guarantor Coverage Test will
continue to be satisfied, (iii) such guarantor is not required to be a guarantor pursuant to the agreed
security principles, (iv) the lenders whose commitments under the Senior Facilities Agreement aggregate
greater than 50% of the total commitments under such facilities consent to such release; or (v) the
resignation of that guarantor is contemplated by the tax structure memorandum or the Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below). Upon the effectiveness of a release pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the
applicable guarantor would have no further obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, including
any obligations to grant Security in any Collateral owned by such guarantor.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the
other matters set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to certain agreed
qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including: (i) status, (ii) binding
obligations, (iii) non-conflict with other obligations, (iv) power and authority, (v) validity and admissibility
in evidence, (vi) governing law and enforcement, (vii) filing and stamp taxes, (viii) information
memorandum, management case and reports, (ix) financial statements, (x) no litigation, (xi) taxation,
(xii) _pari passu ranking, (xiii) investment company act, (xiv) margin regulations; (xv) ERISA; and_
(xvi) compliance with Swiss non-bank rules.

Certain representations and warranties shall be made on the Closing Date and will be repeated on the date
of each utilization, on the first day of each interest period and at certain other times.

**_Springing Financial Covenant_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains a springing senior secured net leverage financial covenant
(‘‘Financial Covenant’’) solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Revolving Credit Facility and
any applicable Incremental Senior Secured Facilities (together the ‘‘Financial Covenant Facilities’’), set at
a flat ratio whereby the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as set out in the relevant compliance certificate
delivered to the agent under Senior Facilities Agreement shall not exceed 9.20:1

The Financial Covenant will be on a last twelve months (‘‘LTM’’) basis as at each financial quarter date on
or after the first testing date (a ‘‘Test Date’’), provided that the Senior Secured Group will only be required
to test the Financial Covenant if as of 5.00 p.m. (in London) on a Test Date, the amount of: (a) all loans
under the Financial Covenant Facilities (excluding: (i) loans to fund any original issue discount or
flex-related payments with respect to Facility B and any Incremental Senior Secured Facility which is a
term facility; (ii) loans made on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) loans used to fund any acquisitions,
capital expenditure or other investments (and, in each case, any rollover loan in respect thereof)) and
(iv) (for the avoidance of doubt) any amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility by way of
ancillary facilities and letters of credit (or bank guarantees)); minus (b) any cash and cash equivalent
investments of the Senior Secured Group, exceeding 40% of the aggregate of: (i) the total commitments of
the Revolving Credit Facility as at the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement; and (ii) the aggregate of all

184


-----

commitments under any Incremental Senior Secured Facility which is a revolving facility and a Financial
Covenant Facility established after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement, (disregarding, in each case,
any reduction in such commitments following the establishment thereof) (the ‘‘Test Condition’’).

The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Senior Facilities
Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indentures and the equivalent definitions
described in this Offering Memorandum.

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the SSN Issuer to cure or
prevent breaches of the Financial Covenant (an ‘‘Equity Cure’’) by the contribution from its shareholders
or any other person to the Senior Secured Group of additional equity, assets and/or subordinated loans
(‘‘Cure Amount’’) to (i) increase the Consolidated EBITDA under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
(‘‘EBITDA Cure’’), (ii) decrease consolidated senior secured net debt as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement (‘‘Net Debt Cure’’), or (iii) prepay loans under a Financial Covenant Facility (‘‘Prepayment
**Cure’’) so that the Test Condition is no longer satisfied. An EBITDA Cure may be exercised on no more**
than five occasions during the term of the Senior Facilities Agreement and no more than two EBITDA
Cures may be made in any three consecutive relevant periods. Any such Equity Cure must be exercised
prior to the date falling 20 Business Days after the date on which the compliance certificate is required to
be delivered.

There shall be no obligation to use any Cure Amount (other than with respect to a Prepayment Cure) in
prepayment of the Senior Secured Facilities. There shall be no cap on the amount of any cure and
over-cures are permitted.

If the Financial Covenant has been breached, but is complied with when tested on any subsequent Test
Date or is otherwise not required to be tested due to the Test Condition not being met on any subsequent
date, then, the prior breach of such Financial Covenant or any event of default arising therefrom shall be
deemed cured unless the requisite super majority of the lenders under any relevant Revolving Credit
Facility (the ‘‘Super Majority Revolving Facility Lenders’’) have exercised their acceleration rights to
declare all or part of the loans under that Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.

The SSN Issuer may elect to recalculate the Test Condition or Financial Covenant for any period at any
time based upon any financial statements (including the latest internally available financial information for
an LTM period) and, if (taking into account such recalculation) the Test Condition is not met or the
Financial Covenant is complied with at such time (due to prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility,
cash or cash equivalents on balance sheet or otherwise), the Financial Covenant shall be deemed complied
with and any prior breach of such Financial Covenant or any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be
deemed cured. For any such calculation, the SSN Issuer may give pro forma effect to all applicable
transactions (and permitted adjustments to any Applicable Metric (being any financial covenant or
financial ratio or incurrence-based permission, test, basket, or threshold, whether any default, event of
default or other relevant breach of the Senior Secured Facilities financing documents has occurred, is
continuing or would result or any other metric, condition or permission) in connection therewith) for
which the applicable transaction date has occurred following the end of the applicable period or any
subsequent relevant period as if such applicable transaction had been consummated on the first day of
such applicable period or relevant period (as applicable).

**_General Undertakings_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain incurrence covenants, information undertakings and
related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments), including (i) limitations on indebtedness;
(ii) limitations on restricted payments; (iii) limitations on liens (which includes the ability to designate
certain credit facilities and/or hedging obligations secured on the Collateral as Super Senior Liabilities (as
defined in the section entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’) if,
prior to such designation, Facility B has been refinanced in full (ignoring any participation (x) of a lender
which has been rolled over in a refinancing (or otherwise) of Facility B and/or (y) in respect of which a
lender has declined prepayment) and the original Revolving Credit Facility (to the extent not fully and
finally discharged) has been designated as Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the section entitled
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’))); (iv) limitations on sale of
assets and subsidiary stock; (v) limitations on affiliate transactions; (vi) designation of restricted and
unrestricted subsidiaries (vii) merger and consolidation undertakings with respect to (x) the SSN Issuer
(y) US Holdco and (z) the guarantors of the Senior Secured Facilities; and (viii) additional intercreditor
agreements.

185


-----

In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement also requires the SSN Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain
exceptions and grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations and consents;
(ii) compliance with laws; (iii) _pari passu ranking; (iv) taxes; (v) centre of main interests; (vi) guarantees_
and security; (vii) further assurance; (viii) anti-corruption law and sanctions; (ix) release condition;
(x) ratings; (xi) compliance with ERISA; (xii) compliance with Swiss non-bank rules; (xiii) no flowback to
Switzerland of proceeds from the USD TLB Facility and certain Incremental Senior Secured Facilities; and
(xiv) certain post-closing undertakings (including granting the post-Closing Date security described above).

The Senior Facilities Agreement also requires the SSN Issuer to comply with certain customary
information undertakings, including delivery of financial statements, sustainability reports and
accompanying compliance certificates, provided that the obligation to deliver financial information and/or
sustainability reports may differ from similar requirements in the Indentures and as described in this
Offering Memorandum.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement will
fall away upon the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) (with permanent effect) the
occurrence of a listing of any member of the Senior Secured Group or a holding company which does not
constitute a Change of Control and in respect of which the Senior Secured Group’s Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio does not exceed 4.25:1; (ii) (while the release condition remains satisfied) the SSN Issuer
or any holding company of the SSN Issuer having a long-term corporate credit rating equal to or higher
than BBB-, Baa3 or BBB- (as applicable) or higher according to any two of Fitch Ratings, Inc., Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services or, in each case, any of its
successors or assigns that is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under the Notes.
In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default, subject to customary
materiality qualifications, thresholds, grace periods, and excluded matters including (i) breach of the
financial covenant, provided that (A) in the event of such breach, only the Super Majority Revolving
Facility Lenders may exercise acceleration rights as a result of such breach and (B) if the Super Majority
Revolving Facility Lenders have exercised such acceleration rights as a result of such breach, the remaining
lenders shall have a right of cross-acceleration; (ii) misrepresentation; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of
the Senior Secured Facilities financing documents; and (iv) material failure to comply with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with
it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law
although the restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the Senior
Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact
that the Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the SUN
Issuer, the SSN Issuer, certain Guarantors and the Trustee are party to and certain other Guarantors will
accede to an Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the agent, arrangers and lenders under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of certain of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the
SUN Issuer, the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider (as defined below), when payments can be made
in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken

member of the Senior Secured Group, in each case designated as Topco Shared Security by the SSN Issuer
(in its discretion) in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or if such
trustee arrangements are not legally possible, in favor of all the Secured Parties or in favor of the Security
Agent under a parallel debt or similar structure). Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities and
present and future obligations of each Topco Borrower that is not a member of the Senior Secured Group
and each of its Subsidiaries other than Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the documents governing
the relevant Topco Notes or Topco Facility (as the case may be)) (the ‘‘Topco Group’’), each Debtor and
any Third Party Security Provider to the Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents.

‘‘Transaction Security’’ refers to security (from the Senior Secured Group, any Third Party Security Provider
and Topco Shared Security (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Topco Independent Transaction
Security)) in each case which, to the extent legally possible and subject to any Agreed Security Principles
(as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement (i) is
created, or expressed to be created, in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured
Parties (or a class of Secured Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations; or (ii) in the case of
any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be granted in favor of the Security Agent as agent or
trustee for the Secured Parties (or a class of Secured Parties), is created, or expressed to be created, in
favor of (x) all the Secured Parties (or a class of Secured Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured
Obligations or (y) the Security Agent under a parallel debt and/or joint and several creditorship or similar

applicable Secured Obligations. Transaction Security which is not Topco Shared Security shall secure all
liabilities and present and future obligations of the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the
Secured Parties (other than the creditors under the Topco Liabilities (as defined below) (the ‘‘Topco
**Secured Parties’’)) under the Secured Debt Documents (other than the finance documents relating to the**
Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Topco Finance Documents’’)). Transaction Security which is Topco Shared Security
shall secure all liabilities and present and future obligations of any member of the Topco Group, the
Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents
(including to the Security agent under a parallel debt) both actual and contingent and whether incurred
solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in any other capacity (the ‘‘Topco Shared Security Secured
**Obligations’’).**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereunder will be Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Notes and Note
Guarantees thereunder will be Topco Notes Liabilities for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Designation Date will not have occurred. On the Issue Date, no Cash Management Facility
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities or Second Lien Notes
Liabilities will be outstanding. Such liabilities (and liabilities in respect of other New Debt Financings) may
only be incurred and/or designated if not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, including,
without limitation, the covenants applicable to the Notes described under ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.’’_

**_Priority of Debts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the SSN Issuer and each other debtor
(under the Intercreditor Agreement (together, the ‘‘Debtors’’) (other than the SUN Issuer and any
member of the Senior Secured Group which is designated as a Topco Borrower under the Intercreditor
Agreement) (a ‘‘Topco Borrower’’))) to the Secured Parties and (in respect of Topco Proceeds Loan
Liabilities only) the Topco Borrowers shall rank in right of priority and payment in the following order and
are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

Facilities Agreement or any future senior secured facilities agreements (a ‘‘Permitted Senior Secured
**Facilities Agreement’’) (the ‘‘Senior Lender Liabilities’’), (ii) the lenders, issuing banks, and ancillary**
lenders in relation to any future super senior facilities agreement (a ‘‘Permitted Super Senior Secured

including, for the avoidance of doubt, the SSN Issuer) to a member of the Senior Secured Group for
the purposes of on lending the proceeds of any Senior Secured Notes together with any additional or
replacement loan made on substantially the same terms (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan
**Liabilities’’), (v) the arrangers, agents, issuing banks and lenders under any cash management facility**
(a ‘‘Cash Management Facility’’ and the liabilities under a Cash Management Facility being the ‘‘Cash
**Management Facility Liabilities’’), (vi) the hedge counterparties in relation to any hedging agreements**
that are not Super Senior Liabilities (the ‘‘Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities’’) (together with the hedging
designated by the SSN Issuer as being Super Senior Liabilities, the ‘‘Hedging Liabilities’’), (vii) the
lenders in relation to any future second lien facility agreement (a ‘‘Second Lien Facility Agreement’’
and the liabilities to the lenders under a Second Lien Facility Agreement being the ‘‘Second Lien
Lender Liabilities’’), (viii) any second lien notes trustee (other than certain amounts paid to it in its
capacity as trustee), the holders of any future second lien notes and the Security Agent in relation to

Lien Lender Liabilities, the ‘‘Second Lien Liabilities’’ and creditors thereof being the ‘‘Second Lien
**Creditors’’), (ix) any agent or trustee under any finance documents relating to any of the**

aforementioned liabilities, any agent or trustee under the Topco Liabilities (as defined below) and to
any agent or trustee in relation to certain other liabilities of such agent or trustee (together the ‘‘Agent
**Liabilities’’), (x) any arranger in connection with the aforementioned liabilities, and (xi) the Security**
Agent, pari passu and without any preference between them; and

(ii) second, all liabilities owed (i) to the trustee (other than certain amounts paid to it in its capacity as
trustee), and the holders of the Topco Notes and any future notes issued by or in relation to which a
New Debt Financing has been made available to or by a Topco Borrower and designated by the SSN
Issuer as Topco Notes and the Security Agent in relation to such Topco Notes (the ‘‘Topco Notes
**Liabilities’’), (ii) under any future loan facility made available to any Topco Borrower (the ‘‘Topco**
**Facility Liabilities’’ and together with the Topco Notes Liabilities, the ‘‘Topco Liabilities’’), (iii) any**

future loan (a ‘‘Topco Proceeds Loan’’) made by any Topco Borrower for the purpose of on lending
the proceeds of any Topco Notes or Topco Loans (the ‘‘Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities’’), pari passu
and without any preference between them.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by any Topco Borrower to the Secured
Parties shall rank pari passu in right and priority of payment and without any preference between them in
respect of (i) the Senior Lender Liabilities, (ii) the Super Senior Liabilities, (iii) the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, (iv) the Cash Management Facility Liabilities, (v) the Hedging Liabilities, (vi) the Second Lien
Lender Liabilities, (vii) the Second Lien Notes Liabilities, (viii) the Topco Liabilities, (ix) the Agent
Liabilities, and (x) any arranger in connection with the aforementioned liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-group liabilities owed by one member of the Senior
Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group which is or becomes party to the
Intercreditor Agreement as an intra-group lender (other than any Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan
Liabilities or Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) (the ‘‘Intra-Group Liabilities’’) will be subordinated to the
liabilities owed by the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the creditors under the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility
Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities, Agent
Liabilities and Notes Liabilities and to any arranger in connection with the aforementioned liabilities (such
creditors, together with the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate, any creditor of the Agent Liabilities
and any arranger with respect to the Secured Liabilities, the ‘‘Secured Parties’’). If and to the extent that
the subordination in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities by an intra-group lender incorporated in
Switzerland pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement exceeds the maximum amount of such
intra-group lender’s unrestricted equity capital surplus available for distribution as dividends to the
shareholders of such intra-group lender (the ‘‘Maximum Amount’’), the subordination shall, if required by
mandatory Swiss law, be limited to the Maximum Amount available at the relevant time.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured
Group (other than any Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) to a holding company of the SSN Issuer or to any
other person who becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a subordinated creditor (a
‘‘Subordinated Creditor’’) (the ‘‘Subordinated Liabilities’’) will be subordinated to the liabilities under the
Debt Documents owed by the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the Secured Parties and any
person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an unsecured creditor, and to the IntraGroup Liabilities.

**_Priority of Security_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security (irrespective of whether the related
Transaction Security documents are themselves expressed to be first ranking or of any lower ranking
security) shall rank and secure the applicable Secured Obligations (but only to the extent that such
Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

(i) first, the Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities (as defined below) pari passu and without any preference
between them;

(ii) second, the Second Lien Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them; and

(iii) third (to the extent of the Topco Shared Security), the Topco Liabilities _pari passu and without any_
preference between them.

190


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Topco Independent Transaction Security (irrespective of
whether the related Topco Independent Transaction Security documents are themselves expressed to be
first ranking or of any lower ranking security) shall rank and secure the applicable Topco Independent
Secured Obligations _pari passu and without any preference between them (but only to the extent such_
Topco Independent Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities).

**_Guarantees and Security: Topco Creditors_**

The creditors in respect of the Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Topco Creditors’’) have the right to take, accept or
receive the benefit of:

(i) any Topco Shared Security from any member of the Senior Secured Group or from a Third Party
Security Provider in respect of the Topco Liabilities if and to the extent legally possible and subject to
any agreed security principles, at the same time it is also offered either:

(A) to the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or applicable class
thereof) in respect of their Liabilities; or

(B) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be (or is not) granted in favor of
the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof):

II. to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure, joint and several creditor structure or
agency structure for the benefit of the other Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof),

and ranks in the same order of priority as described under ‘‘Priority of Security’’ above,
provided that all amounts received or recovered by any Topco Creditor with respect to such
Topco Shared Security are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out
under ‘‘Application of Proceeds’’ below;

(ii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance from any member of the Senior Secured Group in
respect of the Topco Liabilities in addition to any guarantee, indemnity or assurance in the original
form of any Topco Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or given to all the Secured
Parties as security for the liabilities of the Topco Group, each Debtor and any Third Party Security
Provider to the Secured Parties under the Debt Documents if, subject to any agreed security
principles:

(A) (except for any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance permitted by the Finance Documents),
the Secured Parties other than the Topco Creditors (the ‘‘Priority Secured Parties’’) already
benefit from such a guarantee, indemnity or other assurance or at the same time it is also offered
to the Priority Secured Parties and ranks in the same order of priority as described under ‘‘—
_Priority of Debts’’ above, as applicable; and_

(B) all amounts received by any Topco Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or
assurance are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under ‘‘—
_Application of Proceeds’’ below; and_

(iii) any security, guarantee indemnity or other assurance:

(A) from any person that is not a member of the Senior Secured Group; and

(B) from any member of the Senior Secured Group:

I. in connection with any escrow or similar arrangements relating to amounts held by a person
which is not a member of the Topco Group prior to release of those amounts to a member of

Security or Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a member of the Senior
Secured Group in respect of any Topco Liabilities.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements or the assumption or incurrence of any Liabilities
that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien
Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, _Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities or Unsecured_
Liabilities (each a ‘‘New Debt Financing’’). The conditions include certification by the SSN Issuer that such
New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional or supplemental financing, guarantee or debt
arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New
Debt Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each
other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security
document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive
any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking, priority guarantees and
Security of the New Debt Financing, subject to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such
security (which shall be, unless otherwise required by the SSN Issuer, substantially the same (if applicable)
as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (‘‘Permitted Acquired Indebtedness’’) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries
who, after the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise
combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other ownership
interests) in any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an ‘‘Acquired
**Person or Asset’’), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New**
Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt
Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter,
including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is no
requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other
liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is
required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any
Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking
applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to
any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as
a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss is prevented by the documentation relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would
give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any
Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation
thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility
Liabilities (together with the Hedging Liabilities, the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,’’ the creditors
in respect thereof being the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditors’’) at any time, provided that following certain
acceleration events under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement or Senior Secured Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or
following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may
only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with
the provisions described below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ provided that after the Designation Date
there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an

192


-----

enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the
Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an event
of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the ‘‘Senior Secured Liabilities’’ and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the ‘‘Secured Liabilities’’) have been discharged (the ‘‘Senior
**Secured Discharge Date’’), the SSN Issuer, the members of the Senior Secured Group and Third Party**
Security Providers may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities,
in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance
with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured
Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that any required consents to permit such payment have been
obtained), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien
Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a _de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than_
principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement,
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior
Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of
the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the ‘‘Second
**Lien Discharge Date’’) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the ‘‘Priority Discharge**
**Date’’), the SSN Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other members of the Senior**
Secured Group may only make specified payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter,
action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor
Agreement) under the Topco Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together the ‘‘Topco Group
**Liabilities’’) to the Topco Creditors or any Topco Borrower or any holding company of the SSN Issuer or**
other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only)

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a _de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than_
principal, interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash
Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a ‘‘Senior Secured Payment
**Default’’), or under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a ‘‘Second Lien Payment**
**Default’’); and**

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is (x) not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or, if it is so prohibited, any required
consents to permit such payment have been obtained or (y) permitted as a Non-Distressed
Disposal (as defined below) or the result of any claim which is subject to Transaction Security,
(2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest (such other
amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest or
liquidated damages), the accrual of cash interest otherwise payable during a period when a Topco

syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents, or (5) amounts under a
Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement to fund any amount referred to in (1) to (4);

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other

Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or
borrower under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (L)
below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their
debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements
(in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is
(without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not
permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the
Topco Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for

Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which
has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding) which has
been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is
outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during
such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be
made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default
under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is
continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the SSN Issuer (‘‘Debt for Equity
**Swap’’) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities,**
that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or
Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to
another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding
company of the SSN Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to
the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement

its affiliates, (K) funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Topco Liabilities incurred under or
pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L) by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations
under the Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a
member of the Senior Secured Group or such payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco
Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if

194


-----

the payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision
in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or any other provision that
permits the repayment in full of any Topco Creditor (without a related requirement to repay all other
Topco Creditors) and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has
occurred and is continuing and the payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts
made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity
date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as
of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give
prior consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco
Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one (1) Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured
Liabilities (a ‘‘Senior Secured Event of Default’’) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities
(a ‘‘Second Lien Event of Default’’), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super
Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant
stop notice to be delivered) (a ‘‘Topco Payment Stop Notice’’) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the
‘‘Topco Agent’’) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the ‘‘Topco Notes Trustee’’) advising that the Senior
Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the
Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy-nine (179) days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior
Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant
stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco
Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Permitted Topco Enforcement’’ below).

Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty-five (45) days after the occurrence of
the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect
to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred and sixty (360) days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure
to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement
notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group
Liabilities (a ‘‘Topco Enforcement Notice’’) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

195


-----

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and
capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue
notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that
has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the ‘‘Topco
**Investors’’) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments**
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover by the creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien
Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the
‘‘Topco Discharge Date’’) (the ‘‘Final Discharge Date’’) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor
on or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third
Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with
the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’; or

(v) (subject to certain exceptions) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in
relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or
Third Party Security Provider which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—
_Application of Proceeds’’ and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency_

-----

Event (as defined below) in respect of that Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third
Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(A) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to
the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers
from any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any
proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following
an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged
property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent
except in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds.’’

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

‘‘Insolvency Event’’ is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Senior Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making
of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization
(excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness,
(c) (other than on a solvent basis) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or a material part of its assets,
or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or
vexatious proceedings discharged within 20 business days, proceedings or appointments which the Security
Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit
Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled
to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider
(in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such
amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay
that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in
full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set
out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case
of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such
set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that
set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application
_of Proceeds’’ below._

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent
that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands,
collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third

Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in
order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

An ‘‘Instructing Group’’ means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined
below);

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (as defined below); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco
Creditors (as defined below); and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Super Senior Discharge Date’’),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than fifty
(50)% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the ‘‘Majority
**Senior Secured Creditors’’), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the**
Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’) save that, for
instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give
instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under ‘‘—Enforcement of
_Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date’’ and ‘‘—Enforcement of Transaction Security on_
_or After the Designation Date’’ below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than fifty
(50)% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Second Lien Creditors’’); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than fifty (50)% of the Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Topco Creditors’’).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date,
the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce
or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to
enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or
have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor
or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), (in respect of the Topco
Shared Security only) a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors in accordance with the enforcement regime set out under ‘‘—Permitted Topco
_Enforcement’’ below). Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with_
its terms, the Instructing Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the
preceding paragraph may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or
refrain from enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at
any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to
give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security do not give such instruction or do
not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent
shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

198


-----

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good
faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s
ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before
giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action (as
defined below) the agents of the creditors represented in an Instructing Group will be required to consult
with each other agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if
such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) and the Security Agent in good faith for a period of up
to ten Business Days (the ‘‘Consultation Period’’) and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give
the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action (as defined below) after the
expiry of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or after the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the
Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those
instructions (an ‘‘Initial Enforcement Notice’’) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement
they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or
the Super Senior Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the
Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency
Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a
Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior
Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination
as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super
Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realization of
proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has
received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior
Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the
Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), any agent or trustee in relation to the Second
Lien Liabilities (the ‘‘Second Lien Agent’’) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien
Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor
Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given
instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or
(B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) (in respect of the Topco Shared Security only) an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance
Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors). Notwithstanding the preceding
paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors
then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give such instruction and do not indicate any
intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior
Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the
paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they
see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

‘‘Enforcement Principles’’ means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that to
the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement
chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received
in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over A5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a
public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so requested by the

199


-----

Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion
from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of
any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled
at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the
Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the
Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the
paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien

relevant Secured Debt Document); or

(v) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking steps (including the appointment of any liquidator, receiver,

relevant shares remain subject to the same Transaction Security as existed prior to the issue,
(F) proceedings brought by an ancillary lender, a lender of Cash Management Facility Liabilities (a ‘‘Cash

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

Subject to certain exceptions, the restrictions set out above under ‘‘—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco
_Creditors’’ will not apply in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any_
Transaction Security securing the Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
‘‘Relevant Topco Default’’) is continuing;

201


-----

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes
Trustee or the Topco Borrower;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period (as defined below).

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice
notifying any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the ‘‘Senior Agent’’), Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such
event of default.

Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the
earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy-nine (179) days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the
‘‘Topco Standstill Period’’);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor
or Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph (ii) shall not include action taken to
preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against whom
Enforcement Action is to be taken;

Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section ‘‘—Permitted Topco Enforcement’’ in
relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any
later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of
the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by giving
not less than ten (10) days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to themselves of
all, but not part of, the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes
Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date
plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging
obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for
the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on
such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall
(and is irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement,
instruction, direction, confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information from
any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the SSN
Issuer to the Security Agent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the SSN
Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/
or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal
to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any
member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document pursuant
to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group;
and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
‘‘Non-Distressed Disposal’’);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the
SSN Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect
any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take
any action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of
the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor
simultaneously with such release to the extent that the SSN Issuer has confirmed that such
ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or
the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the SSN Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release is
otherwise permitted, in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement);

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior
Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease
to be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or
other member of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities
under the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from
the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt
Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document); and

(iii) effect a Debt Transfer (as defined below).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii) above, the SSN Issuer
shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as
at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the SSN Issuer, on the date that the definitive
agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the SSN Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant

203


-----

release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of
the Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or
a Debtor, to the extent the SSN Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other
transaction or designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco
Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall
have the right to voluntarily prepay any or all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to the
applicable creditors concurrently with ceasing to be a member of the Topco Group or Debtor; and any
right to decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any Debt Document shall be disapplied to the extent
that if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all such liabilities in full by such person (but
without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or other payment required by
the relevant Finance Documents).

The SSN Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super
Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender
Liabilities (each, a ‘‘Borrower’’) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise
transferred by that Borrower (a ‘‘Debt Transfer’’) provided that (i) either (A) such Debt Transfer is to
another member of the Senior Secured Group; (B) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that
Borrower or any holding company of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance
Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied

(C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in connection with an IPO, and (ii) the transferee in respect of such
Debt Transfer is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash

**_Distressed Disposals_**

‘‘Distressed Disposal’’ means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or
shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the
request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable
as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was
made, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which was
continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made, or (c) after the occurrence of an
acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as
a result of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing, by a Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (subject
to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third
Party Security Provider and the SSN Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or
Debtor:

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter
into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities;
(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

204


-----

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of
its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding
company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of
an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors
and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their
subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities (the ‘‘Transferee’’) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or
a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter
into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any
other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor
or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all
(and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other
liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the ‘‘Disposed Entity’’) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the ‘‘Receiving Entity’’) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations
in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving
Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described in paragraph (iv) above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of
an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred,
as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above)
effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain
a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any
obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher
price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid)
in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an
ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior
creditor) immediately following that release.

205


-----

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless
those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured
Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent
liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of
cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the provisions
described above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities
transferred to a holding company of the SSN Issuer specified by such creditor, in which case the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the SSN Issuer and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such
documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the
consent of each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it
is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(ii) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process conducted with the advice of a
reputable, independent and internationally recognized investment bank or firm of accountants or
(if all such banks or firms are conflicted), a reputable, independent and internationally
recognized third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations of
businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject to the relevant Transaction Security)
and, in each case, not being an auditor or administrator or other relevant officer of the applicable
company (a ‘‘Financial Advisor’’) as selected by the Security Agent (it being acknowledged that
the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Advisor until it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in respect of which the Secured
Creditors are entitled to participate (a ‘‘Competitive Sales Process’’); or

(B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an
enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent
and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco
Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with
such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction
Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured
Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or
disposed of (a ‘‘Relevant Claim’’) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser
or its affiliates), and all security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured
Obligations in respect of the assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is

206


-----

simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale,
provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in
good faith) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater cash amount if
such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and not
released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate amount
of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no
bidders) or if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in
good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or
substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of Senior Secured Liabilities and
serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall
be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate;
and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can

Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or
recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking
into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser
unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security
securing Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the provisions described
above, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured
Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or
disposed of (a ‘‘Relevant Claim’’) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser
or its affiliates), and all security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured
Obligations in respect of the assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale,
provided that, if each Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in
respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the
Priority Secured Parties will recover a greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or
otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and not released or discharged and
provided such amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Priority
Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior
Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien
Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully
committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the
Priority Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the
same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant
Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can
be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second
Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or
recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking

207


-----

into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser
unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the
relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in
accordance with the provisions set out under ‘‘—Manner of Enforcement’’ above, and (ii) in any other case
on the instructions of the Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security Agent
sees fit (which may include taking no action).

_Equalization_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the
first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the ‘‘Enforcement Date’’) and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the SSN Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the
Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of
creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or
adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant
agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties, each
affected hedge counterparty) shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ above and the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made, subject to certain
exceptions, without the consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the
Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents),

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver
would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender
under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors other than the Cash Management Facility
Lenders (solely in their capacity as such)),

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor
or class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)), and

(iv) the SSN Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions
or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized
to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its
capacity as such).

Unless the SSN Issuer agrees otherwise (in respect of any individual lender under the Senior Facilities
Agreement constituting a net short lender for the purposes of the Senior Facilities Agreement (a ‘‘Net
Short Lender’’)) the participations and commitments under the Senior Facilities Agreement of any Net
Short Lender shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of both the numerator and the denominator of
the relevant percentage of the relevant credit participations or otherwise when ascertaining whether the
approval of or any instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, all Senior Secured Creditors or
any other class of Creditors (as applicable) have been obtained for all purposes under the Finance
Documents, including with respect to any request for a consent or agreement or requirement for
instructions to be given to the agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement or the Security Agent.

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (including as described below), the
Security Agent (a) may, if the SSN Issuer consents, and shall promptly upon request of the SSN Issuer,
amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any document

210


-----

creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on each
party, and (b) may if the SSN Issuer consents, and shall promptly upon request of the SSN Issuer, amend,
release and/or retake any document creating Transaction Security where such amendment, release and/or
retake is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the relevant Transaction Security,
together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to register any relevant
document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859 of the Companies
Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or
default arising out of such failure to register) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be
binding on each Party.

Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the
assets subject to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or
the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security are distributed, such amendment may not be made without the prior consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees other than an agent under any Cash Management Facility, if appointed
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super
Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities;

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash Management Facility on its
behalf but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor
Agreement in their capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors;

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as
such)), and

(iv) the SSN Issuer.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including any
ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be
effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents’’ are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in_
particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claims or
liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or
refinancing debt or the provisions set out under ‘‘—New Debt Financing,’’ ‘‘—Non-Distressed Disposals’’
and ‘‘—Distressed Disposals’’ above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the
SSN Issuer and the Security Agent.

(ii) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a
similar snooze/lose provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor

(iv) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other
Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision
or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

any creditor:

(A) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days (or any other period of time notified by
the SSN Issuer, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision to operate is
less than ten (10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(B) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent:

1. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s participation (as the case may be)
shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating their participation in respect of the
matter when ascertaining whether any relevant percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
unanimity) of their participation or has been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or
approve that action;

2. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s status shall be disregarded for the
purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of creditors has been
obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve that action; and

3. in the case of paragraph (iv) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have
been given,

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any Noteholder

On or following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an ‘‘IPO Event’’) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with respect to the release of Transaction
Security if required to implement such IPO Event), the SSN Issuer is entitled to give notice to each agent
and each Hedge Counterparty and each Cash Management Facility Lender (a ‘‘Pushdown Notice’’) that
the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate (with effect from the date specified in the
relevant Pushdown Notice (the ‘‘IPO Pushdown Date’’)) so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior
Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or
holding company of the SSN Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such
IPO (the ‘‘IPO Pushdown Entity,’’ provided that (x) if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or
before the IPO Pushdown Date, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the SSN Issuer
which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities and the Senior Secured Group will refer to the
direct Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time and (y) if
the Topco Notes have been refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date but the Senior Secured
Notes have not been refinanced in full, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the SSN Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (the ‘‘IPO Pushdown Group’’), (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of
the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) each reference in the Debt Documents to the SSN Issuer or any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to
the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise), (iv) certain provisions of the Debt
Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default), will cease to apply to any
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall directly or indirectly result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking of event of default, (vi) any borrowing liabilities in respect of the Secured Debt
Documents will be (and will be deemed to have been) novated or otherwise transferred to a member of the
IPO Pushdown Group subject to certain conditions being met, (vii) each holding company of the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations and restrictions
under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security) and (viii) unless otherwise notified by the SSN Issuer, each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party

Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor
will be irrevocably and unconditionally released from its obligations and restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of
any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), the
SSN Issuer and each subsidiary of the SSN Issuer shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and
guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case,
borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any
amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other
Debt Document to the contrary.

**Foreign Exchange Hedging**

The consideration payable for the Acquisition will be sourced from the U.S. dollar and euro proceeds from
each of the Offering, the borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and the Equity Contribution. The
consideration required to be paid in connection with the Acquisition is an amount denominated in Swiss
francs. In order to convert the U.S. dollar and euro funds into amounts denominated in Swiss francs to pay
the consideration, (i) Swiss Holdco has entered into a foreign exchange deal contingent forward
transaction with Deutsche Bank, London branch whereby Swiss Holdco will sell euros and receive Swiss
francs; and (ii) US Holdco has entered into foreign exchange deal contingent forward transactions with
each of Barclays Bank plc and Credit Suisse International, respectively, whereby US Holdco will sell U.S.
dollars and receive Swiss francs (each a ‘‘Deal Contingent Forward Transaction’’). Each Deal Contingent
Forward Transaction is documented under a long form confirmation entered into under a deemed 2002
ISDA Master Agreement and payment of the amounts thereunder are contingent on closing occurring
under the Sale and Purchase Agreement at or before 11:59 pm New York time on March 1, 2022.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

The following is a description of the US$350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of %
Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the ‘‘Notes’’). The Notes will be issued by Herens
Holdco S.`a r.l., a private limited liability company (soci´et´e `a responsabilit´e limit´ee) organized and existing
under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (‘‘Luxembourg’’) with its registered office at 4, rue
Albert Borschette, L-1246 Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg trade and companies register
(R.C.S. Luxembourg) (the ‘‘Luxembourg Companies Register’’) under number B251476 (the ‘‘Company’’).
For purposes of this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ references to (i) the ‘‘Company’’ refer
only to Herens Holdco S.`a r.l. and none of its subsidiaries and (ii) ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ ‘‘Group’’ and ‘‘us’’ refer
only to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date (as defined below), together with the
Equity Contribution (as defined below), the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Notes (as defined
below) sold on the Issue Date and borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined below)
will be used by the Company to finance the Acquisition (as defined below) and to pay fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions (as defined below), as set forth in this offering memorandum
under the caption ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of
certain other conditions as described below, the Company will, concurrently with the closing of the offering
of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to
the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account (as defined below). In the
event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent (as defined
below) shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to
such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the
Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the
Company will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a price equal to
100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, from, and
including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).
See ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the
Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Company and the Issue Date Guarantors (as defined
below) and will not be guaranteed by any member of the Target Group (as defined below). Assuming the
Acquisition Closing Date (as defined below) occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date and the
funds are released from the Escrow Account, the Post-Closing Guarantors (as defined below) will, within
150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined below) and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, accede to the Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) and guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Issue Date Guarantors will control the
Target Group, and none of the Target Companies (as defined below) or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(as defined below) will be subject to the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
Notes.’’ As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Group will
not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants
been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’), to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among, _inter alios, the Company, the Issue Date Guarantors, Lucid Trustee Services Limited, as trustee_
(the ‘‘Trustee’’), Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as paying agent and transfer agent and Lucid
Trustee Services Limited, as security agent (the ‘‘Security Agent’’). The Notes will be issued in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act (as defined below). See
‘‘Notice to Certain Investors.’’ The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, and Holders (as defined below) are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents (as defined below) and the Escrow Agreement. Because
this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read each of
the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and the Escrow
Agreement in their entirety. Copies of such documents are available as described under ‘‘Where You Can
Find More Information.’’ You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under

214


-----

‘‘—Certain Definitions’’ below. The capitalized terms defined in ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’ below are used in
this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ as so defined.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of a conflict between anything in the
Indenture, the Notes or the Security Documents and anything in the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of
the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain
indebtedness, enforcement standstills, payment blockages, turnover obligations, release of security and
guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See ‘‘Description of
Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Company will not be required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the
Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes
for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference
or include, or be subject to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act (as defined below), including
Section 316(b) thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and
the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of
debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the
Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships
between it and us.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will initially be senior obligations solely of the
Company, guaranteed solely by the Issue Date Guarantors, secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as
defined below) and will not have the benefit of any Guarantees or any other credit support from the Target
Group. See ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ Prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date, neither the Company nor the Issue Date Guarantors will control the Target Companies or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, and none of the Target Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries will
be subject to the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes.’’ As such, we
cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities
that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such
entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default
under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

From and after the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Company;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness,
including the Senior Facilities;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including its obligations in respect of its
guarantee of the Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing or future Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Company
that are secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and
assets securing such Indebtedness or liabilities;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of the
subsidiaries of the Company that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors and (ii) within
150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and
substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Post-Closing Guarantors; and

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by certificated Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

215


-----

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will:

- be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

- rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of such_
Guarantor, including the Senior Facilities;

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness or other liabilities of such
Guarantor that are secured by liens that do not secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees to the extent
of the value of such property and assets securing such Indebtedness or liabilities; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of the
subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors.

As of December 31, 2020, after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Company and its_
consolidated Subsidiaries would have had CHF2,665 million (equivalent) of total Indebtedness, including
(i) CHF2,152 million (equivalent) of Indebtedness secured on the Collateral on a first-priority basis,
consisting of (a) CHF1,834 million (equivalent) of term loan drawings under the Senior Facilities and
(b) CHF318.0 million (equivalent) under the Notes; and (ii) CHF512.5 million (equivalent) under the
Senior Notes secured on a portion of the Collateral on a second-priority basis and the Topco Independent
Collateral (as defined under ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’) on a first-priority basis.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Company will issue US$350 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The
Notes will mature on, 2028. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of US$200,000
and in integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, DTC is not required to
monitor or enforce the minimum amount. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to
receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of DTC. If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid,
the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business
Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such
delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2021, to Holders
of record on the and preceding the applicable interest payment date.

From and including, 2025 (the ‘‘Step-up Date’’), the interest rate on the Notes shall increase by
(a) 0.25% per annum unless the Group has achieved at least one Sustainability Performance Target (as
defined below) on the Testing Date (as defined below) (the ‘‘Two KPIs Step-up’’) and (b) 0.125% per
annum unless the Group has achieved both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date (the
‘‘One KPI Step-up’’ and, each of One KPI Step-up and Two KPIs Step-up, a ‘‘Step-up’’), in each case, as
certified by the Company to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an Officer’s Certificate, which
shall also include the Assurance Letter (as defined below), on or prior to the Certification Date (as defined
below); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt (i) the interest rate on the Notes shall not increase if the
Group has met both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date, (ii) the increase in the
interest rate on the Notes on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.125% if either (x) the Group
has met the GHG Emissions Target (as defined below) on the Testing Date but has not met the Waste
Intensity Target (as defined below) on the Testing Date or (y) the Group has met the Waste Intensity
Target on the Testing Date but has not met the GHG Emissions Target on the Testing Date and (iii) in no
event shall the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes on the Step-up Date exceed 0.25% (this
being the consequence of the Group failing to meet both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing
Date)). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the Officer’s Certificate and
Assurance Letter from the Company, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Assurance Letter or related Officer’s Certificate, verify the attainment of the Sustainability Performance
Targets, or make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to the attainment of the

216


-----

Sustainability Performance Targets. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Company,
any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on any Assurance Letter and related Officer’s
Certificate. Any increase of the interest rate applicable to the Notes on the Step-up Date shall also result
in an increase of the optional redemption prices for the Notes as set forth under ‘‘—Optional
Redemption.’’

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Notes:

‘‘Assurance Letter’’ means an assurance letter from an External Reviewer confirming whether the
Sustainability Performance Targets have been met.

‘‘Certification Date’’ means March 31, 2025.

‘‘External Reviewer’’ means a qualified provider of third-party assurance or attestation services (i.e., an
auditing firm) appointed by the Company to review the Group’s compliance with the Sustainability
Performance Targets.

‘‘GHG Emissions’’ means Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions of the Group in a given financial year,
determined in accordance with the Scope 1 and 2 guidance of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard, measured in CO2 equivalent tons per CHF million of total sales of the Group in
a financial year.

‘‘GHG Emissions Target’’ means the Group’s target to reduce GHG Emissions by at least 18 per cent. by
the Testing Date (from the 2018 baseline of 484.0 CO2 equivalent tons per CHF million of total sales of
the Target Group).

‘‘Sustainability Performance Targets’’ means, collectively, the GHG Emissions Target and the Waste Intensity
Target.

‘‘Testing Date’’ means December 31, 2024.

‘‘ton’’ means one metric ton, or 1,000 kilograms.

‘‘Waste Intensity’’ means the volume of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated by the Group in a
given financial year, determined in accordance with the applicable GRI Sustainability Reporting Standard,
measured in tons per CHF million of total sales of the Group in a financial year.

‘‘Waste Intensity Target’’ means the Group’s target to reduce Waste Intensity by at least 12 per cent. by the
Testing Date (from the 2018 baseline of 49.5 tons per CHF million of total sales of the Target Group).

For the purposes of the second and third paragraphs of this ‘‘—Interest’’ section, if during or prior to the
financial year ending on the Testing Date, the Group makes or consummates any Investment or other
acquisition or investment permitted under the Indenture with a fair market value (as determined in good
faith by the Company) exceeding 20% of the Group’s total assets (a ‘‘Qualifying Acquisition’’), the Group
may at its election and acting in good faith: (i) recalculate the baseline used to set our GHG Emissions
Target or our Waste Intensity Target to take account of any such Qualifying Acquisition; or (ii) adjust the
GHG Emissions or the Waste Intensity for the financial year ending on the Testing Date on a pro forma
basis in order to remove the impact of any such Qualifying Acquisition; _provided that any such_
recalculation or adjustment will be included in the Assurance Letter and related Officer’s Certificate.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the
Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest
period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. If the Company delivers global
notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption
date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of
business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional
interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of DTC will be subject to the then applicable
procedures of DTC.

217


-----

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which US$350.0 million aggregate
principal amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. The Company may issue additional Notes (the
‘‘Additional Notes’’) from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants
contained in the Indenture. Any Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes
originally issued, except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate (defined below) supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate
or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on
which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the
record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis
upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of US$200,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in
excess thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;
and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series in such Officer’s Certificate; provided that any Additional Notes that are not
fungible with the Notes offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN,
Common Code or other securities identification number from such Notes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ references
to ‘‘Notes’’ shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as
any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as a series of Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects
to the initial Notes, and shall be deemed to form one series and references to the Notes shall be deemed to
include the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well any such Additional Notes.

**Payments**

Principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes
represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be
made through the Paying Agent (as defined below) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to certificated Notes
will be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’)
or may, at the option of the Company, be made through the Paying Agent by check mailed to the Holders
of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at the option of the
Company, be made by wire transfer to a U.S Dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the
United States, the United Kingdom or Europe if the applicable Holder elects payment by wire transfer by
giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later
than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee
may accept in its discretion).

218


-----

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further
interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Notes in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York,
New York (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas.

The Company will also maintain a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’) for
the Notes. The initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas.

The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if
any, and, together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Company.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the ‘‘Exchange’’) and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any change of
Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying
Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes provided that it segregates and holds in a separate trust fund for
the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as paying agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee
may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a
transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. Any such transfer or exchange
will be made without charge to Holders, other than any taxes payable in connection with such transfer. The
Company and the Transfer Agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer
or an Asset Disposition Offer (each as defined herein). Also, the Company and the Transfer Agent and
Registrar will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery
of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed or between record date and payment date. The
registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the absolute owner of the Note for all purposes. See ‘‘Book
Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, each Issue Date Guarantor will be a ‘‘Restricted Subsidiary’’ of the Company for the
purposes of the Indenture. Immediately after the completion of the Acquisition on the Acquisition Closing
Date, the Target Companies and all of their respective subsidiaries as of such date will become Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Company. However, in the circumstances described below under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Company will be permitted to
designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee, or provide security with respect
to, the Notes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering of the Notes will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.
Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Company will
enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the ‘‘Escrow
_Agreement’’) among the Company, the Trustee, Lucid Agency Services Limited as escrow agent (in such_
capacity, together with its successors, the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’), pursuant to which the Company will deposit, or
cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the
Issue Date into an escrow account (the ‘‘Escrow Account’’). The Escrow Account will be segregated from
the Company’s other funds. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent subject to the

219


-----

terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The initial funds
deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and
other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the Notes (less any
property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary course charges and
fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the ‘‘Escrowed Property.’’
Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest
the Escrowed Property as directed by the Company in such short-term liquid investments (including bank
deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the
Company will from time to time direct in writing.

The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account, upon
instruction of the Company, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the
most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the
Escrow Release (as defined below) in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the
Notes under the Indenture as set forth under ‘‘—Principal, Maturity and Interest.’’ In addition, the Escrow
Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property
in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property.

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the
previous paragraph, the Company will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property
(in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company) (the ‘‘Escrow
_Release’’) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the ‘‘Escrow Release Date’’) upon delivery to_
the Escrow Agent, on or prior to March 1, 2022 (the ‘‘Escrow Longstop Date’’), of an Officer’s Certificate
(the ‘‘Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate’’), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the ‘‘Escrow
_Conditions’’) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release on the_
Escrow Release Date:

(1) the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be required promptly (and in
any event within three Business Days) following the release of the Escrowed Property to
consummate the Acquisition substantially on the terms set forth under ‘‘Summary—The
Transactions;’’ and

(2) the conditions precedent to borrowing under the Senior Facilities (other than any condition
precedent relating to the Escrow Release or satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions) shall have been,
or substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and the Escrow Account
will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the
Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not
be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the ‘‘Special
_Termination Date’’), the Company will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the_
Notes (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) at a price (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal
to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue
Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business
Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, and
will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after
such notice is given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the ‘‘Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date’’). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay_
to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for
such Holder’s Notes, shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and,

220


-----

concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the
Company. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at
least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds the
amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Topco will be required to make an equity contribution to the
Company to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the
amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it.

The Company from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more
replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial
Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the
Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a ‘‘Transfer’’) without such Transfer
being deemed an Escrow Release; provided that the Company provides a substantially equivalent security
interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or
accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and
_provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as_
applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into
which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee
from the Company of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed
consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a
new Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange that the Special
Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption.

In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by
Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and
severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the ‘‘Note Guarantees’’) by the Issue Date
Guarantors. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date
and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis by each of Lonza, LLC;
Lonza Solutions AG; Lonza Services AG; Arch UK Biocides Limited and Arch Personal Care Products,
L.P (the ‘‘Post-Closing Guarantors’’). The Senior Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each
Post-Closing Guarantor. In addition, if required by the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries’’ and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note
Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the year ended December 31,
2020, on an aggregate basis, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated 62% of the Target Group’s sales to
third parties and 61% of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (excluding LSI intercompany
transactions). As of December 31, 2020, on an aggregate basis, the Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for
42% of the Target Group’s total assets (excluding equity investments in subsidiaries and LSI intercompany
transactions).

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that
would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with
corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further
limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under ‘‘Security—General.’’
The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles
include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be

221


-----

restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules,
corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules,
retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital
maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the
validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral’’ and ‘‘—The insolvency laws of
Luxembourg and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the
United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note
Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may
adversely affect their validity and enforceability.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees
and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’

The Company is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital and loan
stock of its Subsidiaries. As such, the Company will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make
payments to it to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes.

A significant portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having
security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of
non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees
issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company and the
Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of
Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture
limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does
not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness under the Indenture. See ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.’’

**_Note Guarantee Releases_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such
Guarantor (as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or
(ii) all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other than the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the Indenture,
as provided in ‘‘—Defeasance’’ and ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge;’’

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(5) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under
the Senior Facilities Agreement, _provided that (i) as of the next applicable test date after giving_
effect to such release and any applicable clean-up period, the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined
in the Senior Facilities Agreement) is met, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner
provided by and subject to the same exceptions as those set forth in the Senior Facilities
Agreement; and (ii) such Guarantor also releases its Senior Note Guarantee;

222


-----

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;’’

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the
covenant under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation;’’

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization or a Permitted Transaction;

(9) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; and

(10) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers.’’

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation
requested pursuant to the Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the
Company, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth
above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other
action or consent on the part of the Trustee. None of the Company, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be
required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. The
Company may in its sole discretion elect to have any Note Guarantee remain in place, as opposed to being
released.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on the Issue Date on a first-priority
basis (collectively, the ‘‘Issue Date Collateral’’) by:

- a limited recourse (i) Luxembourg law share pledge in respect of Topco’s shares in the capital of the
Company; and (ii) a pledge in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to Topco (as
lender) by the Company (as borrower);

- (i) a share pledge in respect of the Company’s shares in the capital of Swiss Holdco (as defined
below); (ii) a pledge in respect of certain structural intercompany receivables owed to the Company
(as lender) by Swiss Holdco and UK Bidco (as defined below) (as borrowers); and (iii) a Luxembourg
law pledge of the Company’s material bank accounts in Luxembourg (without control over use and
freely operational prior to acceleration);

- a pledge of Swiss Holdco’s material bank accounts in Switzerland (without control over use and freely
operational prior to acceleration);

- a share pledge in respect of Swiss Midco’s (as defined below) shares in the capital of US Holdco (as
defined below);

- (i) a share pledge in respect of US Holdco’s shares in the capital of US Bidco (as defined below) and
(ii) New York law all asset security (subject to customary exclusions) in respect of US Holdco’s assets;

- New York law all asset security (subject to customary exclusions) in respect of US Bidco’s assets; and

- an English law debenture granted by UK Bidco, granting security over its material bank accounts and
a fixed charge over shares it holds in other obligors incorporated in England and Wales and a floating
charge over all of its assets (subject to customary exclusions).

In addition:

- within 30 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by (i) a share pledge over Swiss Holdco’s shares in
the capital of Lonza Solutions AG; and (ii) a pledge of any structural intercompany receivables owed
to the Company (as lender) by Lonza Solutions AG (as borrower); and

- within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will be secured by (A) a fixed charge over Lonza

223


-----

Solutions AG’s shares in the capital of UK Bidco and a pledge over its shares in the capital of Swiss
Midco and Lonza Services AG, (B) with respect to any Post-Closing Guarantors which become
borrowers under the Senior Facilities, security over the material bank accounts located in the relevant
Post-Closing Guarantors’ jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary exclusions, including in
respect of accounts that form part of a cash pooling arrangement (or similar or equivalent
arrangement) or that are used in conjunction with any factoring, securitization or other receivables
financing arrangement), (C) with respect to each Post-Closing Guarantor incorporated in the U.S.
(Lonza, LLC and Arch Personal Care Products, L.P.), security over substantially all of such
Post-Closing Guarantor’s assets (subject to customary exclusions, including no real estate security)
and (D) with respect to each Post-Closing Guarantor incorporated in England and Wales (Arch UK
Biocides Limited), floating security over substantially all of its assets located in its jurisdiction of
incorporation (subject to customary exclusions, including no real estate security)

(collectively, the ‘‘Post-Closing Collateral’’ and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the
‘‘Collateral’’).

The Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities on a _pari passu basis and may also secure certain_
Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes as well as certain other future Indebtedness. A portion of the
Collateral, the Topco Shared Collateral (as defined under ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’), will also
secure the Senior Notes and certain other future Indebtedness on a second-priority basis. In addition,
under certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under the Senior
Term Facilities, any Revolving Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to
sub-clause (i)(A)(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on
Indebtedness’’ below, may be re-designated as a ‘‘super senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor
Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of
the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been
paid in full. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and
‘‘—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.’’

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including,
subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other
secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents. Any other
assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes,
any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute ‘‘Collateral.’’ All Collateral will be subject to
the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the
Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens (as defined below).

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed
to the Holders. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the
Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. The
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to
the Holders. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The value of the Collateral
securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may
be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.’’

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
Guarantees and Collateral.’’

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge

224


-----

over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security
Principles, which include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other
competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,
‘‘transfer pricing’’, ‘‘thin capitalization’’, ‘‘earnings stripping’’, ‘‘controlled foreign corporation’’ and
other tax restrictions, ‘‘exchange control restrictions’’, ‘‘capital maintenance’’ rules and ‘‘liquidity
impairment’’ rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a
guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or
otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly provided that, to the extent
requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the
relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost
and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or
otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be
taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable
time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs
and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the
ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including
any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will not be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they
are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the
relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their
officers or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have
the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer of or for any
member of the Group; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security
document shall be subject to such limit;

- a member of the Group will not be required to give a guarantee or enter into security documents if to
do so could require consultation with or the consent of any pensions trustee, agent or regulator (or
equivalent or similar person) or may be prejudicial to the terms of any pension scheme or other
post-employment benefit scheme (or any arrangements relating to any pension scheme or other
post-employment benefit scheme) of a member of the Group or any member of the Group’s
relationship with any pensions trustee, agent or regulator (or equivalent or similar person), provided
that if (and for so long as) any such proposed guarantee or security document: (x) benefits from the
positive consent and approval of the relevant pensions trustee, agent and/or regulator; and (y) is not
prejudicial to the terms of the relevant pension scheme or other post-employment benefit scheme (or
any arrangements relating to such pension scheme or other post-employment benefit scheme or any
member of the Group’s relationship with any pensions trustee, agent or regulator (or equivalent or
similar person)), in each case as determined by the Company or another relevant member of the
Group (in each case, acting in good faith), this paragraph shall not operate to restrict the granting of
such guarantee or security;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and
like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Company and the Security Agent;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be
granted over the material assets only;

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over
certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

225


-----

- any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint
(including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement
(other than restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any
intra-Group loan agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured
or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party,
supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable
security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require
the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member
thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the
security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as
otherwise permitted by the Note Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all
contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights,
benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) which is continuing, and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek
consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security
Principles;

- any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the relevant
security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

- no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no
consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support Acquired
Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the Indenture to remain
outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an
acquisition permitted by the Indenture shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with
respect to the Notes if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired
indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such
Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to
an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be
granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any debt permitted by the Indenture and/or to the
extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Note Document to the contrary;

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be
required;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in
relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or
prevent the creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or
customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- to the extent legally effective and other than for accessory granted under Swiss law, all security will be
given in favor of the Security Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security
Agent to hold one set of security documents for all secured parties); ‘‘parallel debt’’ provisions will be
used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security
documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees
or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a secured party;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another
member of the Group;

- each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted under
the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each security document
shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of
the relevant security document and creation of the relevant security;

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement;

226


-----

- the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will
not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Note
Documents prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event which is continuing;

- no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any ‘‘Excluded Swap Obligations’’ defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled ‘‘Swap
Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation’’, and any update thereto by the LSTA;

- other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no perfection, filing or other
action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or not in
Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
the United States (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) (each, a ‘‘Guarantor
_Jurisdiction’’) or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group not located in a Guarantor_
Jurisdiction; and

- no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be
required to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless (i) required for such documents to
become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Acceleration Event is continuing.

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any term of the Agreed Security Principles and any
term of a Transaction Security Document, the Holder authorizes, instruct and direct the Security Agent to,
and the Security Agent shall promptly (at the option and upon request of the Company) (i) enter into such
amendments to such Transaction Security Document or (ii) release and terminate such Transaction
Security Document and enter into a replacement Transaction Security Document on such amended terms,
in each case as shall be necessary or desirable to cure such conflict or inconsistency.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by
the Company.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the ‘‘Security Interests’’ and each, a ‘‘Security Interest’’) as between (a) the lenders under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the
Security Agent and the Holders under the Indenture; (d) the trustee, the Security Agent and the holders
under the Senior Notes Indenture and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including
Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively,
will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things,
that the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations and
the guarantees thereof are secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests in the Collateral.
In addition, any Revolving Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to
sub-clause (i)(A)(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on
Indebtedness’’ below, may be re-designated as a ‘‘super senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor
Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement
of, or certain distressed disposals of, the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super
senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. The obligations under the Senior Note Guarantees
shall rank in right of priority and payment after liabilities owed, among others, under the Senior Facilities,
the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, and obligations under the Senior
Note Guarantees will be postponed and subordinated to, among others, obligations under the Senior
Facilities, the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations and any guarantees thereof. See ‘‘Description of
Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘—Certain Definitions—Permitted
Collateral Liens.’’

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Company and certain of its Subsidiaries will grant security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations
under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by
the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into
such Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured
parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor

227


-----

Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the holders of the Senior Notes and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to
the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
Security Interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations created under
the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and
the Note Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of
these jurisdictions. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The security interests in
the Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.
The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee
and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests
in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However,
the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under ‘‘—Security—Release of Liens.’’

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the
Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able
to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series
of Notes—The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the
Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance
periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.’’

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’ The ability to enforce may also
be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes, the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note as described below,
each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (without any further
consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents
and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to
it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness,
together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

228


-----

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and
comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any
waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee
or the Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The security interests in
the Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.
The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, release of
the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Company, in connection with any sale or other
disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but
excluding any transaction subject to ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’), if such sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer
of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging
receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant
property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes
following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in
‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(5) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Company as
Receivables Assets in connection with a Receivables Facility;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted
by the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’ For the
avoidance of doubt, Liens in respect of Specified Assets will be released in connection with a Specified
Asset Disposition.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes
and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the
part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the
Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel,
each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has
occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following a public equity offering (an ‘‘IPO Event’’) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with
respect to the release of security if required to implement such IPO Event), the Company shall be entitled
to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a ‘‘Pushdown Notice’’)) that the terms of the Debt Documents
shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the ‘‘Pushdown Date’’))
on the basis that:

(i) references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only
to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;

(ii) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any parent
entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the
IPO Pushdown Entity;

(iii) each reference in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) to the ‘‘Company’’ shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to
the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and provided that nothing in this
paragraph, including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause (iii) and any action
taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Company, shall, or shall be
deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking, covenant or other term in the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the other collateral documents
or a Default or an Event of Default;

(iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default, as
applicable, in the Debt Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is a
Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the Notes or otherwise);

(v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant or
other term in the Debt Documents or a Default or an Event of Default;

(vi) each Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released
from all obligations and restrictions under the Debt Documents and any security granted by any
such Parent Entity;

(vii) each Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity will not, on the Pushdown Date after giving _pro_
_forma effect thereto, have any assets (other than shares in its subsidiaries and intercompany_
receivables) that are material to, or reasonably necessary for the operation of, the business of the
Group;

(viii) unless otherwise notified by the Company: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a ‘‘Subordinated Creditor,’’ ‘‘Third
Party Security Provider,’’ ‘‘Investor’’ or ‘‘Topco Independent Obligor’’ (as such terms are defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) (each in such capacity, a ‘‘Released Person’’) shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Company, that Person shall
cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) in
the applicable capacity as a Released Person and shall have no further rights or obligations under
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) in that capacity); and
(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Released Person; and

(ix) in the event that any Person is released from or ceases to be or become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a Released Person as a consequence of
this paragraph, any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any Person be a Released Person or that
any liabilities or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

230


-----

The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any
amendment to, release of, or replacement of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the other
security documents required by the Company and/or take such other action as is required by the Company
in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this covenant
(collectively, an ‘‘IPO Pushdown’’); provided, that such amendment, replacement or other document or
instrument will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other
agents party thereto or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the
Trustee, the Security Agent or any other agents party thereto under the Indenture, Intercreditor
Agreement or Security Documents. The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are
each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of the Notes (without any consent by the
Holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended, released or replacement documents and/or take other
such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the request of the Company).

For the purpose of this covenant, the ‘‘IPO Pushdown Entity’’ shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company or a Parent Entity of the Company notified to the Trustee by the Company in writing as the
Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the
IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company which will issue shares, or whose
shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a parent entity of such Restricted Subsidiary) and,
_provided further, that (a) if the Topco Notes (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are not refinanced_
in full on or before the Pushdown Date, this section ‘‘IPO Debt Pushdown’’ shall operate such that (i) for
the purposes of the Topco Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or Topco Liabilities (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Topco Borrower (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity as determined by the first clause of this paragraph and the Topco Group
(and all related provisions) shall comprise that IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from
time to time; and (ii) for the purposes of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or Liabilities (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) other than the Topco Liabilities (and all related provisions)
references to the ‘‘IPO Pushdown Entity’’ shall be construed as reference to the direct Subsidiary of the
IPO Pushdown Entity as determined by the first clause of this paragraph and its Restricted Subsidiaries
from time to time; or (b) if the Topco Notes have been refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date
but the Notes have not been refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date, the Company shall be the
IPO Pushdown Entity and the Group (and all related provisions) shall continue to comprise the Company
and its Subsidiaries from time to time.

If the Company delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this section
‘‘IPO Debt Pushdown’’ in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that
Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the
Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph: (i) the
provisions of clauses (i) to (vii) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in relation to
that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs in
reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary will as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document in
respect of that security; and (iii) if any Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the capacity of a
Released Person has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to clauses (vi) or (vii) of
the first paragraph or the third paragraph of this covenant in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that
Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as the applicable
Released Person. For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or otherwise
restrict the Company from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated
IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any
action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that
Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and except as described under ‘‘—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’ the Notes
are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Company may, at its option, redeem the
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium with respect to the

231


-----

Notes as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Company may, at its option, during each
twelve month period following the Issue Date redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the
Notes (including any Additional Notes), upon giving notice as described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’
at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Company may, at its option, redeem an
aggregate principal amount of Notes not to exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company from
one or more Equity Offerings or a contribution to the Company’s common share capital made with the Net
Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, at a redemption price equal to % of the principal
amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date; provided that:

(1) the aggregate principal amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including Additional Notes);

(2) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the
Indenture on the Issue Date (excluding Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption (unless all Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently);
and

(3) each such redemption occurs not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2024, other than in the event of a Step-up, the
Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole or in part, upon notice as described under
‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth

_Other Redemptions Terms_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Company, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such
purchase date, to redeem all Notes, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at
a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such
tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to
any provision of the Indenture regarding Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by
the Company or its Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by
an Affiliate of the Company or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such
determination.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’ below.

Notice of any redemption (other than a Special Mandatory Redemption) of the Notes may, at the
Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an
incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any
redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so
subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition,
and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to
purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole
discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event
that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole
discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or
that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s sole discretion if the Company determines
that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Company may provide in
such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Company’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Company may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and
a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different
provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have
different redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on
the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Except as described under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ the
Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase
Notes as described under ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock.’’ As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the
Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time
seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments

233


-----

related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject
to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made
by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured
debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase
transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to
a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading
liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases of Notes made at prices below the
‘‘adjusted issue price’’ (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation
of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to
us.

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC will redeem an equal amount
of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof).

Under the existing practice of DTC, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC
will credit their respective participants’ accounts either by lottery or on a pro rata pass-through distribution
basis in accordance with the applicable procedures and rules of DTC unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange rules; _provided, however, that no Book Entry Interest of less than US$200,000_
principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through DTC, the Notes will be
selected on a _pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination_
remains outstanding after such redemption; _provided, however, that no Note of US$200,000 in aggregate_
principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of US$1,000 shall
be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made
under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least
10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at
the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a legal or covenant
defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the
Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes
and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the Exchange of any change in the
principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will
be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global
note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an
amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice
(including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed
for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Company may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under ‘‘Withholding Taxes,’’ if any, then due

234


-----

and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Company determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under
‘‘—Withholding Taxes’’) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative
practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

a Payor (as defined below under ‘‘—Withholding Taxes’’) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect
of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased Additional Amounts) with
respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement
cannot be made by the Company or a Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available
to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this
would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or
after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a
Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes
and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘Selection and Notice.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts
cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Company or
another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and
(b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a ‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s
interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or
on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

235


-----

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments)
such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding
or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been
received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on_
account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if
the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in or place of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of
rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder
or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor
addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any
such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents
or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in
the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required)
more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is
first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have
been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day
period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect
to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

236


-----

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through
1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement
relating thereto;

(7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under section 3406 of the Code;

(8) any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the Holder of the
Notes (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such Holder holds such Notes, or a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Holder if such Holder is an estate, trust,
partnership, or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a
fiduciary Holder of such Notes) being or having been a ‘‘10-percent shareholder’’ of the Company
as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the Code or any successor provision;

(9) any U.S. federal withholding taxes that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the
beneficial owner being a bank purchasing the Notes in the ordinary course of its lending business
within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or any successor provision; or

(10) any combination of the items (1) through (9) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary
or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held
such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such
other reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee
(with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon
reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any
Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee
and the relevant Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the
relevant Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to
pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the
Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to
the payment date). The Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such
Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ there is
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to
any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto

237


-----

(in each case, other than in connection with a transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to the extent
of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest
on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through
(3) and (5) through (10) (save that in respect of clause (5), this proviso shall not apply in connection with
transfer, personal property or similar Taxes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to
the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a Change of
Control Offer or (ii) the Company previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a
redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under
this heading ‘‘—Change of Control,’’ the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
(provided that Notes of US$200,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in
part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after
the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name
the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase
date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a
notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of
DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to
repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be
no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional
Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating
that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies
certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the
Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder
and trigger the Change of Control Offer requirements under the Senior Notes Indenture and other
financing arrangements of a Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may
contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their
right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even
if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of
the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and,
thus, the removal of incumbent management.

238


-----

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur
additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture
will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if
(i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made
by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of
Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the
Indenture as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment
of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to
the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as
to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change
of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, if an event constitutes a Change of Control, the
definitions of Change of Control and Permitted Holders expressly permit a third party to obtain control of
the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a
Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control
Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below
under ‘‘—Certain Covenants.’’

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

(the occurrence of such events, a ‘‘Covenant Suspension Event’’ and the date thereof being referred to as
the ‘‘Suspension Date’’), then, beginning on the Suspension Date until the occurrence of the Reversion
Date (as defined below), (i) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a
specific amount is set out in the Indenture and any definitions used therein (including all ‘‘annual,’’ ‘‘life of
facilities’’, ‘‘fiscal year’’, ‘‘financial year’’, ‘‘calendar year’’, ‘‘at any time’’ and ‘‘aggregate’’ baskets) shall be

239


-----

increased by fifty (50) per cent and (ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this
offering memorandum will no longer be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

- ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;’’

- the provisions of clause (iv) under ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—Company;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;’’ and

- ‘‘—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company may not designate any
of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant
protection. In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent
date (the ‘‘Reversion Date’’) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency
withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes below an
Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating
Agency), then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the
Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the
Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’ The
Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a
Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to
zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens
to the extent provided for under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens)
and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as
though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period
(but solely for purposes of the ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ covenant and the ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ and
‘‘Permitted Collateral Liens’’ definitions and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to
exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply
with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; _provided, that (1) with respect to_
Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made
as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period
(including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all
Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued
in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified
to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on
Indebtedness;’’ (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such reinstatement
pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate
Transactions;’’ (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions
from Restricted Subsidiaries;’’ (5) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries’’ after
such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any

240


-----

Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in
connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to
have been made under clause (i) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments.’’

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or
the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period,
or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension
Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension
Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken
or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Company
and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor,
comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any
Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The
Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the
ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date have occurred,
or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro
_forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either: (i) the Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio is at least 2.00:1.00 or (ii) the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 7.30:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

LTM EBITDA; plus

(C) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test
Date after giving _pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Senior Secured Net Leverage_
Ratio either does not increase as a result or does not exceed 5.10:1.00; plus

(D) the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured on the Collateral that is not Senior Secured
Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test Date after giving _pro forma effect to such_
Incurrence, either:

(1) the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio either does not increase as a result or does not
exceed 6.30:1.00; or

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio either does not decrease as a result or is at least
2.00:1.00; plus

241


-----

(E) the maximum amount of Indebtedness not secured on Collateral or unsecured such that on
the Applicable Test Date, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, either:

(1) the Total Net Leverage Ratio either does not increase as a result or does not exceed
7.30:1.00; or

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio either does not decrease as a result or is at least
2.00:1.00;

_provided that any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness Incurred or_
deemed to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (i) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing
does not exceed the greater of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred pursuant to this clause (i) on the Applicable Test Date for such refinancing and (y) the
aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of
Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and
unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing) and, in the case of a
refinancing of Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR), Facility B (USD) or the Original Revolving
Facility, such Indebtedness shall be treated for all purposes as Incurred pursuant to clause (A)(1),
(A)(2) and (A)(3) above, respectively;

(ii) any (A) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (B) without limiting the covenant set
out under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens,’’ Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or

thereof; and (2) the Senior Note Guarantees in respect of the Senior Notes (other than any
additional Senior Notes) issued on the Issue Date and (3) any loans pursuant to which the
proceeds of any Topco Notes (including the Senior Notes) are lent to the Company, to the
extent that (I) the issuance of and Incurrence of Indebtedness under such Topco Notes is

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; in an aggregate
amount not to exceed:

(A) an amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof
and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this

EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date; plus

(B) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that:

(1) after giving effect to such acquisition (including an acquisition of any assets), merger,
amalgamation or consolidation or similar transaction or capital expenditure:

(I) if such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, either (x) the Company
would be permitted to Incur at least A1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
to clause (i)(C) of this paragraph or (y) the Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio would not increase as a result;

(II) if such Indebtedness constitutes Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral
but is not Senior Secured Indebtedness, either (x) the Company would be
permitted to Incur at least A1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
clause (i)(D) of this paragraph, (y) the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio

For purposes of determining compliance with, and without prejudice to the section ‘‘Financial
Calculations,’’ and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to,
and in compliance with, this covenant:

(i) subject to clause (ii) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is
entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole
discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and will
only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of
such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph of this covenant or one of the
clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need
not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be
permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant
permitting such Indebtedness;

(ii) all Indebtedness under Facility B, the Original Revolving Facility, the Senior Note Guarantees and
the Topco Proceeds Loan, in each case outstanding as of the Acquisition Closing Date (and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to:

(A) clause (i)(A)(1) above, in the case of Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR);

(B) clause (i)(A)(2) above, in the case of Indebtedness under Facility B (USD);

(C) clauses (i)(A)(3) above, in the case of Indebtedness under the Original Revolving Facility,

proceeds of the Senior Notes are lent to the Company,

and the Company shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;

(iii) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a ‘‘cash sweep’’ or
‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of
this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on
the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront
fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(v) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

included;

(vii) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

247


-----

(viii) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under any facility or enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness, the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any
Applicable Metric for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the
Company’s option (A) on the date of such facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or
(B) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any other
Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the case of (A) and (B) of this clause (viii) that the full amount
thereof (or, at the option of the Company, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date)
and, in either case, if any such Applicable Metric is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the
Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount (excluding any such amount in
respect of Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee
facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility
or ancillary facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement)) permitted to be borrowed or
reborrowed on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (viii) but not actually borrowed on
such date shall be the ‘‘Reserved Indebtedness Amount’’ as of such date for purposes of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of any clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such
clauses);

(ix) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred
to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this covenant or
any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM
EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the
Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be
deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront
fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;
and

(x) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than
the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof
determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness,
the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
covenant; _provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding_
Indebtedness may (in the Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued
and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in
respect of such Indebtedness and such Increased Amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the
purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Company shall be in
default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness
denominated in a given currency, the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) denominated

248


-----

in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was incurred, or, at the option of the Company, first committed or first incurred or
upon execution of the definitive documentation in respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Currency
Equivalent); provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in
another currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable currency denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
currency denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) set forth in sub-clause (c) of the definition of ‘‘Refinancing
Indebtedness’’.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) (i) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described
in the second paragraph of this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant and/or (iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Company will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based
on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the Applicable
Test Date of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of
any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted
Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in
good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or
otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any of the
Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent
Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a
‘‘direct or indirect’’ action by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company), whether owned on the Acquisition Closing Date or acquired after
that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any
Indebtedness (such Lien, the ‘‘Initial Lien’’), except:

(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral:

(A) Permitted Liens; or

256


-----

(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Notes and
the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with or prior to, or, in the case of
Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured; and

(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the first paragraph of this covenant
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the
Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and/or under the relevant Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the
Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a purchase price in excess
of the greater of (x) CHF 86.2 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty (20) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA, except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least seventy-five (75) per cent. of the
consideration for such Asset Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the
Acquisition Closing Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalent Investments; and provided that the
amount of:

(A) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on
the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in
the footnotes thereto or, if Incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance
sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Company’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or
increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the
Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by
their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are (1) assumed by the transferee of any such
assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written agreement
which releases or indemnifies the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such
liabilities or (2) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the
Company acting in good faith to be converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
into Cash Equivalent Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent Investments
received or expected to be received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash
Equivalent Investments within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the closing of
such Asset Disposition; and

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together

257


-----

with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (C) that
is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) an
amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM EBITDA at the time of the receipt of
such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (or, at the Company’s option, at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalent Investments for purposes of this provision and for no
other purpose; and

(iii) an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset
Disposition is applied, to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
elects (at its sole discretion):

(A) to prepay, repay or purchase:

(1) any Senior Secured Indebtedness; and/or

(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application would comply with the
covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’),

(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash
received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary); and/or

(C) to make any Restricted Payment or Permitted Payment permitted to be made under the
covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or any Permitted
Investment,

in each case, within five hundred and forty-five (545) days from the later of (1) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that:

(1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant
to sub-clause (iii)(A) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire
such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the
case of any asset-based credit facility, any revolving credit facility (including a
Revolving Facility)) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so
prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 545th day
shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of
such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Company, or such Restricted
Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith
expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment
or letter of intent within the later of such 545th day and one hundred and eighty
(180) days of such commitment or letter of intent (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’); and

(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in
accordance with sub-clauses (iii)(A) to (iii)(C) above, the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such
Net Available Cash in any manner permitted by the Indenture.

The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Indenture:

(i) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such
Asset Disposition exceeds 6.05:1.00, one hundred (100) per cent of the Net Available Cash from
such Asset Disposition; or

(ii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such
Asset Disposition exceeds 5.80:1.00 but does not exceed 6.05:1.00, fifty (50) per cent. of the Net
Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or

258


-----

(iii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such
Asset Disposition does not exceed 5.80:1.00, zero (0) per cent of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition;

in each case, provided that:

(A) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase
any amount of Notes or other Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price of no less than one hundred
(100) per cent. of the principal amount thereof, and has extended such offer to the Holders of the
Notes on at least a pari passu basis to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior Secured
Indebtedness (including the Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for
such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Company will be deemed to have applied an amount
of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this clause (A), and such amount
shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate
amount described under the fourth paragraph of this covenant, the ‘‘Declined Proceeds’’); and

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to
clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above shall be immediately available to the Group for any
purposes permitted by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with
clause (xxiv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Restricted
Payments,’’ without regard to the periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

On the 546th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of
an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
under this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) CHF 129.3 million and (y) an amount equal to thirty
(30) per cent. of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company will within ten (10) Business Days
make an offer (an ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by
the terms of any other Senior Secured Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Secured Indebtedness,
to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and
such Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in
cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted
value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such Senior Secured
Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the agreement(s) governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness.

The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the
expiration of the relevant five hundred and forty-five (545) days (or such longer period provided above)
(the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer Period’’) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the ‘‘Advance
_Portion’’) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an ‘‘Advance Offer’’)._

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and other Senior Secured
Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the
Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall
prepay, repay or purchase the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro
_rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such_
Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes
or Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized
denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of
Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero
(0) (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon
consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be
deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose permitted by
the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Senior Secured
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount
offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the
Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance
Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

259


-----

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees
(but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such
consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net
Available Cash in any manner permitted by the Indenture.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent
amount determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements
to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes
pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the
Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance
the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such
borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to
purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(x) CHF 43.1 million and (y) an amount equal to ten (10) per cent. of LTM EBITDA unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(x) CHF 64.7 million and (y) an amount equal to fifteen (15) per cent. of LTM EBITDA, the terms
of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company; _provided that any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have_
satisfied the requirements set forth in this clause (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a
majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Company, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(i) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or any Permitted Investment;

(ii) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or

program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive
plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans, transaction bonuses or transaction

Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in, or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; or

(B) due to the fact that a director of such person is also a director of the Company or any direct

a director of the Company or such direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company, as the
case may be, on any matter involving such other person);

Company’s Affiliates;

(xvii) any:

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities),
(b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other

agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired
by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection with such
transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another
Person is the Successor Company (as defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(v) any encumbrance, restriction or condition: (A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting,
assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract

(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under this

(C) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or
other agreement to which the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; _provided that such agreement_
prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the
proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or (D) pursuant to
customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal
easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(xiii) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the covenant
described under ‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness’’ if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Facilities,
together with the Transaction Security Documents associated therewith, or the Indenture, together
with the Security Documents associated therewith, or the Senior Notes Indenture, together with the
Topco Security Documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case,
as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Company) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Company
determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only
during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

referred to in clauses (i) to (xiv) of this paragraph or this clause (xv) (an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (i) to (xiv) of this paragraph or this clause (xv); _provided, however, that the encumbrances_
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Company).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment
made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments
pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more
clauses of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Payments’’ or ‘‘Permitted Investments,’’ as determined by the
Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if

265


-----

the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause
a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee on the date of such designation by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that
such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described
under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to
meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be
deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted
to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Indebtedness,’’ the Company will be in default of such covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted_
Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only
be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
Indebtedness’’ (including pursuant to clause (v) of the second paragraph thereof treating such
redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such
designation had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Test Date; and (2) no Event of Default would
be in existence following such designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the
preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
following the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, 150 days) after the end
of each fiscal year of the Company, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021,

provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2), (3) or (4) of the first paragraph of this
‘‘Reports’’ covenant); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the
extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case
of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description
of all material debt instruments and (v) a summary description of material risk factors and material
recent developments; provided that the information described in clause (iv) may be provided in the
footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, 90 days) after the end of
each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, commencing with the
quarter ending June 30, 2021, quarterly financial statements containing the following information:
(i) the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter
and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to
date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior
period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited _pro forma income statement_

most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro
_forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable_
expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and
material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company and (iv) material recent

acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer
of the Company or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a description of such
event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not
‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under
any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of this Indenture) shall be
prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or
otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except
as may otherwise be described in such information; _provided, however, that the reports set forth in_
clauses (1), (3) and (4) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that
applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the
Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to
U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s _pro forma consolidated_
revenue or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first
paragraph of this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which,
if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and
other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next subsequent paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Company, any current or future company in the Target Group or any Parent Entity or IPO
Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent
regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock Exchange) and the Company, such current or
future company in the Target Group or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and
disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of

267


-----

the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted
to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish
Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock
Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or
the Swiss Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards (or the applicable
standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish
Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock
Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and _provided that such_
requirements require the Company, any current or future company in the Target Group or any Parent
Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York
Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Company will be deemed to have complied
with the provisions contained in this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
‘‘Reports’’ covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity
of the Company so long as such reports (if an annual, half-yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant as if references to
the Company therein were references to such Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated
financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not
the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and
(v) the total consolidated amounts; or (y) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Company (including the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) that
represents substantially all the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (the ‘‘Reporting
_Subsidiary’’) so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the_
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant as if references to
the Company therein were references to the Reporting Subsidiary and (b) include condensed consolidated
financial information together with separate columns for: (i) the Company, (ii) the Reporting Subsidiary
and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Company that are
not the Reporting Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Reporting Subsidiary on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the
requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Any reports in respect of periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date (including in respect
of any comparative information) may, upon the election of the Company, include only the consolidated
financial information of the Target Group without any other financial information, after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions. For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made
under the Indenture, the Company may use financial statements of a predecessor of the Company or the
Target Group for reporting or making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect
to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the
confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances
be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the
other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest in any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the
covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’; provided, that the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not

268


-----

prohibited by the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘—Limitation on
Liens’’, including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released
in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture or the Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge,
transfer or release of any Collateral or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the Indenture and the
Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents may be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect or inconsistency therein; (2) for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (3) to add to
the Collateral; (4) to make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any
material respect; or (5) to amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or
release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets)
any Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization and/or Permitted Tax
Restructuring or a transaction not prohibited by the covenants described under ‘‘Merger and
Consolidation’’; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (4) and (5) above, no Security Document may
be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless
contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement supplement, replacement or
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets), the Company delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (i) a solvency opinion,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent
Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed
by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (ii) a certificate
from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the
solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed
by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (iii) an Opinion
of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or
release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets) and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien
is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications)
consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, other
than a Guarantor or a Securitization Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) any syndicated Credit
Facility or (ii) Public Debt of the Company or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of
the greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) 25% of LTM EBITDA at such time, unless such Restricted
Subsidiary within 60 days after the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes and delivers a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with
respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its
express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any
such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in
right of payment to such Note Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes; _provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any_

269


-----

Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not
incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The
Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the
60-day period described in this paragraph.

At the option of the Company, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the
extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under ‘‘Note
Guarantees—Note Guarantee Releases.’’ A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at
the option of the Company if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with this Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a
Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any
release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other
limitations on the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability
of the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of: (i) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as
otherwise required herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in
sub-clause (i) above, the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the
Security Interests, _provided that: (A) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any_
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or
the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee
or the Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor
Agreement; (B) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative
terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict; and (C) regardless of the number of Intercreditor
Agreements or Additional Intercreditor agreements, only one payment blockage notice may be served in
any period of 360 consecutive days or in respect of the same event or circumstance and any such payment
blockages may not be in effect for more than 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day
period.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking
junior to the Notes); (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision

270


-----

for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes; (vi) implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens; (vii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof; or (viii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to
ensure that the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by first-priority Liens over the Collateral. In
formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The Indenture will also provide that the Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, other than: (i) in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) with the
consent of the requisite majority of Holders except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘—Amendments
and Waivers’’, and the Company may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the
Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect their
respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
requisite majority of Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, provided that such
transaction would comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at
the option of the Company, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Company elects to determine any
Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give _pro forma effect to any other Applicable_
Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; _provided that the_ _pro_
_forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable_
Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that
(a) the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a
more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed
to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as
contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested
at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been
complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such
Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a
result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event
of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due
to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions
will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of
Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

271


-----

Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’, in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action or_
transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior
to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Company
determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such
Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is
committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in
reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio
based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other
debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility
under the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to paragraph (viii) of the
third paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness’’ any undrawn commitments
for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the
Applicable Metric.

For purposes of determining compliance with (A) any euro-denominated Applicable Metric, the Euro
Equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange
selected by the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange transaction entered into by the Group in relation
to the Applicable Transaction or any rate referred to in paragraph (C) below); (B) any CHF-denominated
Applicable Metric, the CHF equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated
using a rate of exchange selected by the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable
Test Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange transaction entered into
by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction or any rate referred to in paragraph (C) below); or
(C) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio
under the Note Documents), the euro-equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated, at the Company’s option, using any of (i) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates
over the relevant Testing Period; (ii) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial
statements or management accounts; or (iii) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Company
(acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test
Date, if applicable); or (iv) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging
arrangement entered into by any member of the Group, and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or
any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent
change in the euro or CHF equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange
rates.

Without prejudice to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company may, from time to time, by
notice to the Trustee, redenominate any Applicable Metric denominated in a particular currency into CHF,
euro or U.S. Dollar (as it may elect) by reference to any rate referred to in clause (C) of the immediately
preceding paragraph and, on and from the date of such notice, such Applicable Metric shall for all
purposes be construed as being denominated in such currency specified by the Company in the amount
determined by the Company in accordance with this paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in this
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial
definitions or component thereof, the Company shall be permitted to (A) exclude all or any part of any
expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting
from (i) the Transactions, (ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the
Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting, (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and
branding or re-branding of existing businesses, (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v) research and development
expenditure (and the capitalization thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from
Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or
any equivalent measure under the Accounting Principles) or any other changes in the applicable
Accounting Principles, provided that the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases) is either excluded or
included consistently in both Indebtedness and Consolidated EBITDA in any single such calculation;
and/or (B) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including
anticipated Synergies) or costs or expenses (i) of a type reflected in this offering memorandum and/or any

272


-----

base case model or quality of earnings report relating to an Investment or acquisition permitted under the
Indenture prepared by an independent third party and/or (ii) taken into account in determining
(x) consolidated EBITDA or (y) the financing EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for an
Investment or acquisition permitted under the Indenture.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the ‘‘numerical
_permission’’) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the ‘‘grower permission’’) and the grower permission of_
the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an acquisition
or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be
increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such
acquisitions and/or investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the
grower permission.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is
incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be
permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based
permission. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant
Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an ‘‘Annual
_Period’’):_

(i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if
positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the
amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the
‘‘Carry Forward Amount’’); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the
immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following
Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the ‘‘Carry Back Amount’’); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against
the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such
Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the
Carry Back Amount.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
to any person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be a person organized
and existing under the laws of England, Luxembourg, United States, Switzerland, a Member State
of the European Union (or any other jurisdiction approved by all of the Holders) and the Successor
Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by way of supplemental indenture, executed
and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the Notes, the
Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, as applicable;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and:

(A) the Company or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional A1.00
of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation
on Indebtedness;’’ or

273


-----

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio
would not be higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable,
are legal and binding agreements enforceable against the Successor Company; _provided that in_
giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact;
and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially
equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent
concept)) guarantees and security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the
shares (or other interests) in the Company or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets
or shares (or other interests) cease to exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the
Company cease to exist, security will be granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the
shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Company under the Notes and the Indenture.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(i) consolidate with or merge with or into any person;

(ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, to any person; or

(iii) permit any person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction); or

(B) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture and
all obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, and immediately after giving effect to the
transaction, no Default is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in
each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the
Indenture.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this covenant ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to):

(a) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or a Guarantor from consolidating with,
merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to the Company, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or
a Guarantor;

(b) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties
and assets to the Company or a Guarantor;

274


-----

(c) any consolidation or merger of the Company into any Guarantor; _provided that, if the_
Company is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation:

(A) the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Company under the Notes,
the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of
the covenant described under ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—Company’’ above shall
apply to such transaction; and

(B) to the extent that any Collateral previously granted over the shares in the capital of
the relevant Guarantor would not, in accordance with applicable law, constitute a
Lien over the shares in the capital of the surviving entity, the direct Parent Holding
Company of the surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant
Collateral in the form of Security Interests over the shares in the capital of the
surviving entity on substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interests granted
over the shares in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to
such merger or consolidation;

(d) the Company or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity;
_provided that, in the case of a consolidation, merger or combination of:_

(A) the Company into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) of the covenant described under ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—
Company’’ shall apply to such transaction; and

(B) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, sub-clause (iii) above shall apply to such
transaction; or

(e) the Transactions or any Permitted Transaction.

_Other Merger and Consolidation Terms_

A Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not be deemed to be the sale, assignment, conveyance,
transfer, lease or disposal of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company or one or
more Subsidiaries of the Company, and such Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not be subject to
the covenants described under ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation—Company’’ and this ‘‘Merger and
Consolidation—Guarantors’’ covenant.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict to the
Transactions or the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

**Events of Default**

Subject to the two succeeding paragraphs, each of the following is an Event of Default under the
Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for thirty
(30) days;

(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(c) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for sixty (60) days after written notice by the
Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(d) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may
be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by
the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company

275


-----

or any Significant Subsidiary in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the
date hereof, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a _‘‘payment_
_default’’); or_

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross_acceleration provision’’),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such payment
defaults or accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), is in excess of the
greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA;

(e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Topco, the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’) which, in each case, are sanctioned by a court and become
unconditional;

(f) failure by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
the greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA, other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies
issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid,
undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than sixty (60) days (after receipt of notice from
the Agent) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or
decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’);

(g) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of
CHF 43.1 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid
or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such
Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the
‘‘security default provisions’’);

(h) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of any one
or more Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more
Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note
Guarantee (the ‘‘guarantee default provisions’’); and

(i) the failure by the Company to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent
required, as described under ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

However, a Default under clauses (d) or (f) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of
Default unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes have notified the Company of the Default and (ii) the Company has not cured such
Default within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice provided that a notice of Default may not be
given with respect to any action taken and reported to the Agent, more than two years prior to such notice
of Default. Notwithstanding any other term of the Note Documents, no Permitted Transaction shall (or
shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in (whether directly or indirectly), a Default or an Event of
Default, and each such event, transaction or arrangement shall be expressly permitted under the terms of
the Note Documents. In addition, notwithstanding any other term of the Note Documents, it will not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default if the Company fails to achieve any Sustainability Performance
Target, or fails to provide any Officer’s Certificate or Assurance Letter with respect to its performance
against the Sustainability Performance Targets, and the sole recourse of Holders in such instance shall be

276


-----

the right to receive the applicable increase in interest rate, in the manner described under ‘‘—Interest’’ and
the associated change to the optional redemption prices under ‘‘—Optional Redemption.’’

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this
section ‘‘Events of Default’’) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the
Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company
and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall,
declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable
immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (d) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant
to such clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within
thirty (30) days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section ‘‘Events of Default’’
occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may
only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences
(including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant titled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except
to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

277


-----

(5) the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which
a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise
of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that
the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other
Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its
sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing
of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within
60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their
status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the other Note Documents
may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions,
any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of
principal or premium, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any Note (including in connection with an
offer to purchase), except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture and the other Note Documents may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
Notes).

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (7) of this
paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes, an amendment or waiver may not,
with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other
than provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions
relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption’’ and
‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’;

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of,
or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘Withholding Taxes’’ that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms

278


-----

of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture; _provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the provisions_
governing a Change of Control, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests
granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the
consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes) and any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent
of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum
denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the Company
or a Guarantor under any Note Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a
Permitted Reorganization);

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders
or make any change (including changing the CUSIP, ISIN, common code or other identifying
number on any Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any
material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be
issued in compliance with this Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘—Limitation on
Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ to add Note Guarantees with respect to
the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes
when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under any Debt Document of a successor
Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any
Note Document;

(8) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest
in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, in any property which is required by the

279


-----

Security Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is
required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest
in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is
not prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
Interest’’ is complied with;

(9) conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of
the Senior Secured Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture,
the Security Documents or the Notes;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of
Notes; _provided, however, that (i) compliance with the this Indenture as so amended would not_
result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any
material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ and ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’, relating to
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; and

(13) comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
Agreements’’.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ or this section ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’ shall be
deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or
premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture
by any Holder given in connection with a sale or tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid
by such sale or tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’ to add
a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for
the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Company,
(ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture
need only be duly authorized and executed by the Company, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the
extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company, or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company, will be
considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will
be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a responsible officer of the
Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Independent
Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or
under direct or indirect common control with the Company.

280


-----

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of Topco, the Company and the Guarantors under
the Note Documents (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith
and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security
Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation’’—The Company) and ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and the
default provisions relating to such covenants described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above, the operation
of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions
(other than with respect to the Company), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision, and
the security default provision described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the
Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (c), (d), (e) (with respect only to
Significant Subsidiaries), (f) or (g) under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in U.S. Dollars or U.S. Government Securities, or a combination thereof, for the
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case
may be; _provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the_
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the ‘‘Applicable Premium
_Deficit’’) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any_
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders
and beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of
Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable
U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously

281


-----

authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company)
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated
Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent in the
name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited, or caused to be deposited with
the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money
in U.S. Dollars or U.S Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay
and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of deposit (in the
case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the
case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or
prior to the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit
that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the
Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Company has
delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Company
has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all
conditions precedent under the ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

If requested in writing by the Company to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, the Trustee will distribute any
amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be;
_provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the_
Company of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as
set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other
premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by
accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Lucid Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty. Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder
has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against
any loss, liability or expense.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of
the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in

282


-----

respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to
the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not
eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than
6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. In formulating its decisions, the Trustee and the
Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems
appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

**Notices**

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the
Exchange so require, notices of the Company with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Exchange.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any
Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC in accordance with
the applicable procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests. To the extent the mandatory
rules and procedures of DTC conflict with any such requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of the Indenture if it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of DTC.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person
by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed
within the time prescribed. Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder
or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is electronically delivered or mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether
or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given through DTC, it is duly given on the
day the notice is given to DTC.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment
thereof. Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be
prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

U.S. Dollar is the required currency (the ‘‘Required Currency’’) of account and payment for all sums
payable by the Company and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note
Guarantees thereof, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than
the Required Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Company, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder,
any Paying Agent or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Company or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent
of the amount of the Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If the

283


-----

amount in that other currency is less than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the
recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee under any Note, the Company and the Guarantors will
indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the
Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be _prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note, or any_
Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Company’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder of a Note, any Paying Agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee,
or to the Trustee. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance
with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the
Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange
will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the
Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Company and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the
United States of America. The Indenture will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will appoint
an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New
York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For
the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the
consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The
Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The Security
Documents will be governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.
For the avoidance of doubt, articles 470-1 to 470-19 of the Luxembourg law of August 10, 1915 relating to
commercial companies as amended will not apply in respect of the Notes.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES**

The following is a description of the A460,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % SustainabilityLinked Senior Notes due 2029 (the ‘‘Notes’’). The Notes will be issued by Herens Midco S.`a r.l., a private
limited liability company (soci´et´e `a responsabilit´e limit´ee) organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg (‘‘Luxembourg’’) with its registered office at 4, rue Albert Borschette, L - 1246 Luxembourg
and registered with the Luxembourg trade and companies register (R.C.S. Luxembourg) (the ‘‘Luxembourg
_Companies Register’’) under number B251419 (the ‘‘Company’’). For purposes of this ‘‘Description of the_
Senior Notes,’’ references to (i) the ‘‘Company’’ refer only to Herens Midco S.`a r.l. and none of its
subsidiaries and (ii) ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ ‘‘Group’’ and ‘‘us’’ refer only to the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date (as defined below) and the Equity
Contribution (as defined below) will be provided by the Company to Herens Holdco S.`a r.l., a private
limited liability company _(soci´et´e `a responsabilit´e limit´ee) organized and existing under the laws of_
Luxembourg with its registered office at 4, rue Albert Borschette, L - 1246 Luxembourg and registered
with the Luxembourg Companies Register under number B251476 (‘‘Holdco’’) to be used, together with
the proceeds of the offering of the Secured Notes (as defined below) sold on the Issue Date and
borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined below), to finance the Acquisition (as
defined below) and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (as defined
below), as set forth in this offering memorandum under the caption ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ Pending
consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the
Company will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit, or
cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the
Issue Date into the Escrow Account (as defined below). In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as
defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent (as defined below) shall not have received the Escrow
Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the
Escrow Agent in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be
consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Company will redeem the entire outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated
on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and
Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.’’ Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations
of the Company and the Issue Date Guarantors (as defined below) and will not be guaranteed by any
member of the Target Group (as defined below). Assuming the Acquisition Closing Date (as defined
below) occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date and the funds are released from the Escrow
Account, the Post-Closing Guarantors (as defined below) will, within 150 days from (and excluding) the
Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined below) and substantially
concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
accede to the Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) and
guarantee the Notes on a senior subordinated basis.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Issue Date Guarantors will control the
Target Group, and none of the Target Companies (as defined below) or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(as defined below) will be subject to the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes.’’ As
such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in
activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable
to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of
Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’), to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among, _inter alios, the Company, the Issue Date Guarantors, Lucid Trustee Services Limited, as trustee_
(the ‘‘Trustee’’), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, transfer agent and registrar and
Lucid Trustee Services Limited, as security agent (the ‘‘Security Agent’’). The Notes will be issued in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act (as defined
below). See ‘‘Notice to Certain Investors.’’ The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, and Holders (as defined below) are referred to the Indenture for a statement
thereof.

336


-----

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Topco Security Documents (as defined below) and the Escrow Agreement.
Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read
each of the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Topco Security Documents and the
Escrow Agreement in their entirety. Copies of such documents are available as described under ‘‘Where
You Can Find More Information.’’ You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description
under ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’ below. The capitalized terms defined in ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’ below are
used in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ as so defined.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of a conflict between anything in the
Indenture, the Notes or the Topco Security Documents and anything in the Intercreditor Agreement, the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important
to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect
of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain
indebtedness, enforcement standstills, payment blockages, turnover obligations, release of security and
guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See ‘‘Description of
Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Company will not be required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the
Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes
for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference
or include, or be subject to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act (as defined below), including
Section 316(b) thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and
the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of
debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the
Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships
between it and us.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will initially be senior obligations solely of the
Company, guaranteed solely by the Issue Date Guarantors, secured (i) on a first-priority basis by the Topco
Independent Collateral (as defined below), and on a second-priority basis by the Topco Shared Collateral
(as defined below) and will not have the benefit of any Guarantees or any other credit support from the
Target Group. See ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ Prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Issue Date Guarantors will control the Target Companies or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, and none of the Target Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes.’’ As such,
we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in
activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable
to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of
Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

From and after the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Company;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing or future Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Company
that are secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and
assets securing such Indebtedness or liabilities;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of
Subsidiaries of the Company that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors;

- be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors and
(ii) within 150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and

337


-----

substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Post-Closing Guarantors; and

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by certificated Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will:

- be a general senior subordinated obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

- be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Guarantor,
including its obligations under the Senior Facilities and the Secured Notes;

- rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior subordinated_
indebtedness of such Guarantor;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor;

- be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future Indebtedness or other liabilities of such
Guarantor that are secured by liens that do not secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees, or that are
secured on a first-priority basis over property or assets that secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees
on a second-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or
liabilities; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness and other liabilities of the
subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors.

As of December 31, 2020, after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Company and its_
consolidated Subsidiaries would have had CHF2,665 million (equivalent) of total Indebtedness, including
(i) CHF2,152 million (equivalent) of Indebtedness secured, among other things, on the Topco Shared
Collateral on a first-priority basis, consisting of (a) CHF1,834 million (equivalent) of term loan drawings
under the Senior Facilities and (b) CHF318.0 million (equivalent) under the Secured Notes; and
(ii) CHF512.5 million (equivalent) of Indebtedness secured on the Topco Shared Collateral on a secondpriority basis and the Topco Independent Collateral on a first-priority basis, consisting of the Notes.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Company will issue A460.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes
will mature on, 2029. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of A100,000 and
in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Euroclear and Clearstream
are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests
in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at
the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further
interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2021, to Holders of
record on the and preceding the applicable interest payment date.

From and including, 2025 (the ‘‘Step-up Date’’), the interest rate on the Notes shall increase by
(a) 0.25% per annum unless the Group has achieved at least one Sustainability Performance Target (as
defined below) on the Testing Date (as defined below) (the ‘‘Two KPIs Step-up’’) and (b) 0.125% per
annum unless the Group has achieved both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date (the
‘‘One KPI Step-up’’ and, each of One KPI Step-up and Two KPIs Step-up, a ‘‘Step-up’’), in each case, as
certified by the Company to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an Officer’s Certificate, which
shall also include the Assurance Letter (as defined below), on or prior to the Certification Date (as defined
below); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt (i) the interest rate on the Notes shall not increase if the
Group has met both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing Date, (ii) the increase in the
interest rate on the Notes on the Step-up Date shall not exceed a total of 0.125% if either (x) the Group

338


-----

has met the GHG Emissions Target (as defined below) on the Testing Date but has not met the Waste
Intensity Target (as defined below) on the Testing Date or (y) the Group has met the Waste Intensity
Target on the Testing Date but has not met the GHG Emissions Target on the Testing Date and (iii) in no
event shall the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes on the Step-up Date exceed 0.25% (this
being the consequence of the Group failing to meet both Sustainability Performance Targets on the Testing
Date)). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the Officer’s Certificate and
Assurance Letter from the Company, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Assurance Letter or related Officer’s Certificate, verify the attainment of the Sustainability Performance
Targets, or make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to the attainment of the
Sustainability Performance Targets. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Company,
any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on any Assurance Letter and related Officer’s
Certificate. Any increase of the interest rate applicable to the Notes on the Step-up Date shall also result
in an increase of the optional redemption prices for the Notes as set forth under ‘‘—Optional
Redemption.’’

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Notes:

‘‘Assurance Letter’’ means an assurance letter from an External Reviewer confirming whether the
Sustainability Performance Targets have been met.

‘‘Certification Date’’ means March 31, 2025.

‘‘External Reviewer’’ means a qualified provider of third-party assurance or attestation services (i.e., an
auditing firm) appointed by Holdco to review the Group’s compliance with the Sustainability Performance
Targets.

‘‘GHG Emissions’’ means Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions of the Group in a given financial year,
determined in accordance with the Scope 1 and 2 guidance of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard, measured in CO2 equivalent tons per CHF million of total sales of the Group in
a financial year.

‘‘GHG Emissions Target’’ means the Group’s target to reduce GHG Emissions by at least 18 per cent. by
the Testing Date (from the 2018 baseline of 484.0 CO2 equivalent tons per CHF million of total sales of
the Target Group).

‘‘Sustainability Performance Targets’’ means, collectively, the GHG Emissions Target and the Waste Intensity
Target.

‘‘Testing Date’’ means December 31, 2024.

‘‘ton’’ means one metric ton, or 1,000 kilograms.

‘‘Waste Intensity’’ means the volume of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated by the Group in a
given financial year, determined in accordance with the applicable GRI Sustainability Reporting Standard,
measured in tons per CHF million of total sales of the Group in a financial year.

‘‘Waste Intensity Target’’ means the Group’s target to reduce Waste Intensity by at least 12 per cent. by the
Testing Date (from the 2018 baseline of 49.5 tons per CHF million of total sales of the Target Group).

For the purposes of the second and third paragraphs of this ‘‘—Interest’’ section, if during or prior to the
financial year ending on the Testing Date, the Group makes or consummates any Investment or other
acquisition or investment permitted under the Indenture with a fair market value (as determined in good
faith by the Company) exceeding 20% of the Group’s total assets (a ‘‘Qualifying Acquisition’’), the Group
may at its election and acting in good faith: (i) recalculate the baseline used to set our GHG Emissions
Target or our Waste Intensity Target to take account of any such Qualifying Acquisition; or (ii) adjust the
GHG Emissions or the Waste Intensity for the financial year ending on the Testing Date on a pro forma
basis in order to remove the impact of any such Qualifying Acquisition; _provided that any such_
recalculation or adjustment will be included in the Assurance Letter and related Officer’s Certificate.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the
Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest
period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. If the Company delivers global

339


-----

notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption
date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of
business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the
Company.

Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be subject
to the then applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that
hold an interest in the relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable
interest payment date.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which A460.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. The Company may issue additional Notes (the ‘‘Additional
_Notes’’) from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the_
Indenture. Any Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes originally issued,
except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (defined
below) supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which
such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates
for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which
such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series in such Officer’s Certificate; provided that any Additional Notes that are not
fungible with the Notes offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN,
Common Code or other securities identification number from such Notes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes,’’ references to
‘‘Notes’’ shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any
Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as a series of Notes initially
issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the
initial Notes, and shall be deemed to form one series and references to the Notes shall be deemed to
include the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well any such Additional Notes.

**Payments**

Principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes
represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by the common depositary of
Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee will be made through the Paying Agent (as defined below) by

340


-----

wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders
thereof.

Principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to certificated Notes
will be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’)
or, may, at the option of the Company, be made through the Paying Agent by check mailed to the Holders
of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of
principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to certificated Notes
may, at the option of the Company, be made by wire transfer to a euro account maintained by the payee
with a bank in the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe if the applicable Holder elects payment
by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such
account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date
as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a
Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled
to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be
entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Notes in London, United Kingdom (including the
initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Company will also maintain a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’) for
the Notes. The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and the initial Transfer
Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if
any, and, together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Company.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the ‘‘Exchange’’) and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any change of
Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying
Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes provided that it segregates and holds in a separate trust fund for
the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as paying agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee
may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a
transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. Any such transfer or exchange
will be made without charge to Holders, other than any taxes payable in connection with such transfer. The
Company and the Transfer Agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer
or an Asset Disposition Offer (each as defined herein). Also, the Company and the Transfer Agent and
Registrar will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery
of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed or between record date and payment date. The
registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the absolute owner of the Note for all purposes. See ‘‘Book
Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, each Issue Date Guarantor will be a ‘‘Restricted Subsidiary’’ of the Company for the
purposes of the Indenture. Immediately after the completion of the Acquisition on the Acquisition Closing
Date, the Target Companies and all of their respective subsidiaries as of such date will become Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Company. However, in the circumstances described below under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Company will be permitted to
designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject

341


-----

to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee, or provide security with respect
to, the Notes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering of the Notes will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.
Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Company will
enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the ‘‘Escrow
_Agreement’’) among the Company, the Trustee, Lucid Agency Services Limited as escrow agent (in such_
capacity, together with its successors, the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’), pursuant to which the Company will deposit, or
cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the
Issue Date into an escrow account (the ‘‘Escrow Account’’). The Escrow Account will be segregated from
the Company’s other funds. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent subject to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The initial funds
deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and
other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the Notes (less any
property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary course charges and
fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the ‘‘Escrowed Property.’’
Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest
the Escrowed Property as directed by the Company in such short-term liquid investments (including bank
deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the
Company will from time to time direct in writing.

The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account, upon
instruction of the Company, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the
most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the
Escrow Release (as defined below) in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the
Notes under the Indenture as set forth under ‘‘—Principal, Maturity and Interest.’’ In addition, the Escrow
Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property
in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property.

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the
previous paragraph, the Company will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property
(in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company) (the ‘‘Escrow
_Release’’) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the ‘‘Escrow Release Date’’) upon delivery to_
the Escrow Agent, on or prior to March 1, 2022 (the ‘‘Escrow Longstop Date’’), of an Officer’s Certificate
(the ‘‘Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate’’), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the ‘‘Escrow
_Conditions’’) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release on the_
Escrow Release Date:

(1) the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be required promptly (and in any
event within three Business Days) following the release of the Escrowed Property to consummate the
Acquisition substantially on the terms set forth under ‘‘Summary—The Transactions;’’ and

(2) the conditions precedent to borrowing under the Senior Facilities (other than any condition precedent
relating to the Escrow Release or satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions) shall have been, or
substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and the Escrow Account
will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the
Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not
be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the ‘‘Special
_Termination Date’’), the Company will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the_
Notes (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) at a price (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal

342


-----

to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue
Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business
Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, and
will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after
such notice is given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the ‘‘Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date’’). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay_
to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for
such Holder’s Notes, shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and,
concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the
Company. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at
least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds the
amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Parentco will be required to make an equity contribution to
the Company to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the
amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it.

The Company from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more
replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial
Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the
Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a ‘‘Transfer’’) without such Transfer
being deemed an Escrow Release; provided that the Company provides a substantially equivalent security
interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or
accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and
_provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as_
applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into
which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee
from the Company of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed
consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a
new Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange that the Special
Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption.

In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by
Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and
severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (the ‘‘Note Guarantees’’) by the Issue
Date Guarantors. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Acquisition Closing
Date and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by each of
Lonza, LLC; Lonza Solutions AG; Lonza Services AG; Arch UK Biocides Limited and Arch Personal
Care Products, L.P (the ‘‘Post-Closing Guarantors’’). The Senior Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior
basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In addition, if required by the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries’’ and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, on an aggregate basis, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated 62% of the Target
Group’s sales to third parties and 61% of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (excluding LSI

343


-----

intercompany transactions). As of December 31, 2020, on an aggregate basis, the Post-Closing Guarantors
accounted for 42% of the Target Group’s total assets (excluding equity investments in subsidiaries and LSI
intercompany transactions).

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that
would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with
corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further
limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under ‘‘Security—General.’’
The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes and the Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles
include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be
restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules,
corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules,
retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance
and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and
enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral’’ and ‘‘—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and
other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or
those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the
Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their
validity and enforceability.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’

The Company is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital and loan
stock of its Subsidiaries. As such, the Company will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make
payments to it to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes.

A significant portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having
security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of
non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees
issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company and the
Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of
Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture
limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does
not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness under the Indenture. See ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.’’

**_Subordination of the Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantees will be senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Guarantees will rank behind, and will be
expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any
obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes and any future Indebtedness ranking pari passu
therewith. As a result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be
entitled to receive full payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to
Holders of the Notes in respect of such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The ability to take enforcement
action against the Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement,
and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For example,
the ability of the Trustee or the Holders to take enforcement action with respect to the Note Guarantees
will be subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement.
The Trustee and the Holders will not be able to enforce the Note Guarantees until the expiration of the

344


-----

applicable standstill period (generally 179 days) for so long as amounts under Senior Indebtedness remain
outstanding. In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of
Holdco pursuant to an enforcement of security over shares of Holdco taken by the Security Agent acting at
the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination
provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of
the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in any
insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets,
or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all
Senior Indebtedness. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Notes—Your right to receive
payment under the Note Guarantees of Senior Notes is contractually subordinated to senior ranking debt
of the Guarantors.’’

**Note Guarantee Releases**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such
Guarantor (as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or (ii) all
or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as
provided in ‘‘—Defeasance’’ and ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge;’’

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(5) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under
the Senior Facilities Agreement, provided that (i) as of the next applicable test date after giving effect
to such release and any applicable clean-up period, the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined in the
Senior Facilities Agreement) is met, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and
subject to the same exceptions as those set forth in the Senior Facilities Agreement; and (ii) such
Guarantor also releases its Secured Note Guarantee;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;’’

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the
covenant under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation;’’

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization or a Permitted Transaction;

(9) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; and

(10) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers.’’

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation
requested pursuant to the Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the
Company, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth
above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other
action or consent on the part of the Trustee. None of the Company, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be
required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. The
Company may in its sole discretion elect to have any Note Guarantee remain in place, as opposed to being
released.

345


-----

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on the Issue Date (collectively, the
‘‘Collateral’’):

- on a first-ranking basis by: (i) a Luxembourg law share pledge in respect of Parentco’s shares in the
capital of the Company granted pursuant to a Luxembourg law governed share pledge agreement;
(ii) a Luxembourg law pledge in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to Parentco
by the Company granted pursuant to a Luxembourg law governed receivables pledge; and (iii) a
Luxembourg law pledge in respect of the Company’s material bank accounts located in Luxembourg
(without control over use and freely operational prior to acceleration) pursuant to a Luxembourg law
governed bank account pledge agreement (collectively, the ‘‘Topco Independent Collateral’’); and

- on a second-ranking basis by: (i) a Luxembourg law share pledge in respect of the Company’s shares
in the capital of Holdco granted pursuant to a Luxembourg law governed share pledge agreement;
and (ii) a Luxembourg law pledge in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the
Company by Holdco pursuant to a Luxembourg law governed receivables pledge (collectively, the
_‘‘Topco Shared Collateral’’)._

The Collateral may also secure any Additional Notes, as well as certain future Indebtedness, on a _pari_
_passu basis. The Topco Shared Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities and the Secured Notes and_
may also secure certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness, on a first-priority basis.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including,
subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other
secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Topco Security Documents. Any
other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the
Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute ‘‘Collateral.’’ All Collateral will be
subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation
of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens (as defined below).

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed
to the Holders. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the
Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. The
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to
the Holders. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The value of the Collateral
securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may
be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.’’

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
Guarantees and Collateral.’’

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge
over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security
Principles, which include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other
competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,

346


-----

‘‘transfer pricing’’, ‘‘thin capitalization’’, ‘‘earnings stripping’’, ‘‘controlled foreign corporation’’ and
other tax restrictions, ‘‘exchange control restrictions’’, ‘‘capital maintenance’’ rules and ‘‘liquidity
impairment’’ rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a
guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or
otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly provided that, to the extent
requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the
relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost
and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or
otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be
taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable
time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs
and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the
ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including
any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will not be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they
are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the
relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their
officers or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have
the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer of or for any
member of the Group; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security
document shall be subject to such limit;

- a member of the Group will not be required to give a guarantee or enter into security documents if to
do so could require consultation with or the consent of any pensions trustee, agent or regulator (or
equivalent or similar person) or may be prejudicial to the terms of any pension scheme or other
post-employment benefit scheme (or any arrangements relating to any pension scheme or other
post-employment benefit scheme) of a member of the Group or any member of the Group’s
relationship with any pensions trustee, agent or regulator (or equivalent or similar person), provided
that if (and for so long as) any such proposed guarantee or security document: (x) benefits from the
positive consent and approval of the relevant pensions trustee, agent and/or regulator; and (y) is not
prejudicial to the terms of the relevant pension scheme or other post-employment benefit scheme (or
any arrangements relating to such pension scheme or other post-employment benefit scheme or any
member of the Group’s relationship with any pensions trustee, agent or regulator (or equivalent or
similar person)), in each case as determined by the Holdco or another relevant member of the Group
(in each case, acting in good faith), this paragraph shall not operate to restrict the granting of such
guarantee or security;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and
like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Company and the Security Agent;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be
granted over the material assets only;

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over
certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint
(including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement
(other than restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any
intra-Group loan agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured
or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party,
supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable

347


-----

security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require
the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member
thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the
security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as
otherwise permitted by the Note Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all
contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights,
benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) which is continuing, and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek
consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security
Principles;

- any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the relevant
security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

- no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no
consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support Acquired
Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the Indenture to remain
outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an
acquisition permitted by the Indenture shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with
respect to the Notes if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired
indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such
Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to
an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be
granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any debt permitted by the Indenture and/or to the
extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Note Document to the contrary;

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be
required;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in
relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or
prevent the creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or
customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- to the extent legally effective and other than for accessory granted under Swiss law, all security will be
given in favor of the Security Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security
Agent to hold one set of security documents for all secured parties); ‘‘parallel debt’’ provisions will be
used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security
documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees
or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a secured party;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another
member of the Group;

- each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted under
the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each security document
shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of
the relevant security document and creation of the relevant security;

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement;

- the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will
not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Note
Documents prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event which is continuing;

- no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any ‘‘Excluded Swap Obligations’’ defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled ‘‘Swap
Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation’’, and any update thereto by the LSTA;

348


-----

- other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no perfection, filing or other
action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or not in
Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
the United States (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) (each, a ‘‘Guarantor
_Jurisdiction’’) or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group not located in a Guarantor_
Jurisdiction; and

- no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be
required to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless (i) required for such documents to
become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Acceleration Event is continuing.

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any term of the Agreed Security Principles and any
term of a Transaction Security Document, the Holder authorizes, instruct and direct the Security Agent to,
and the Security Agent shall promptly (at the option and upon request of Holdco) (i) enter into such
amendments to such Transaction Security Document or (ii) release and terminate such Transaction
Security Document and enter into a replacement Transaction Security Document on such amended terms,
in each case as shall be necessary or desirable to cure such conflict or inconsistency.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by
the Company.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Topco
Security Documents (the ‘‘Security Interests’’ and each, a ‘‘Security Interest’’) as between (a) the lenders
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Indenture; (d) the trustee, the Security Agent and
the holders under the Secured Notes Indenture and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by such Collateral,
respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among
other things, that (i) the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Secured Notes and certain
Hedging Obligations and the guarantees thereof are secured equally and ratably by, among other things,
first-priority Security Interests in the Topco Shared Collateral and (ii) the Notes and the guarantees
thereof are secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests in the Topco Independent
Collateral and second-priority Security Interests in the Topco Shared Collateral. Under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of, or certain distressed
disposals of, the (y) Topco Independent Collateral on a _pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the_
Company that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and (z) the Topco Shared Collateral
only after any existing or future Indebtedness with a prior-ranking Lien on such Topco Shared Collateral is
repaid in full, including the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The circumstances in which the holders of the
Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of the Security Interests over
the Topco Shared Collateral are significantly limited. Generally, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that
the holders of first-ranking security interests in the Topco Shared Collateral will be entitled to control
virtually all decisions relating to the exercise of remedies with respect to these security interests, will be
able to block enforcement of such security interests, will be able to release the security interests
constituting Topco Shared Collateral in certain circumstances and will receive any proceeds from the
enforcement of those security interests before amounts will be available to the holders of the Notes.

In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the holders of the
Notes) to take enforcement action under the Security Documents with respect to the Topco Shared
Collateral are subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on
enforcement. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may only act through the Security Agent and will
not be able to independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents or
until the expiration of the applicable standstill period (being a period of up to 179 days subject to certain
exceptions) and for so long as any amounts under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging
Obligations and any such other Senior Indebtedness or obligations remain outstanding, force a sale of such
Topco Shared Collateral. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Topco Security Documents, the Company and Parentco will grant security over the Collateral to
secure the payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes,
the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Topco Security Documents will be entered into by the
relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such
Topco Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured
parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the holders of the Secured Notes and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to
the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
Security Interests, the relevant Topco Security Documents will secure ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations created
under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes
and the Note Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of
these jurisdictions. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The security interests in
the Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.
The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Topco Security Documents on behalf of the
Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under
the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security
Agent. In addition, prior to the discharge of obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes,
certain Hedging Obligations and other obligations constituting priority indebtedness under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the representatives of the Holders will be subject to a 179-day standstill on the
taking of any enforcement action over the Topco Shared Collateral. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Topco Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests
in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However,
the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under ‘‘—Security—Release of Liens.’’

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Topco Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the
Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Topco Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in
connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or
restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in
certain jurisdictions.’’

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Topco
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under ‘‘Description of Certain
Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’ The ability to
enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on
the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Secured Notes, the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note as described below,
each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness.

350


-----

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (without any further
consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Topco Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically
given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Security Documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Topco Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Topco Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on
its behalf).

See the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The security interests in
the Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.
The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, release of
the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Company, in connection with any sale or other
disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but
excluding any transaction subject to ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’), if such sale or other disposition
does not violate the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets
and Subsidiary Stock’’ and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital
Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to
a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets
remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or
disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and
‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(5) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Company as
Receivables Assets in connection with a Receivables Facility;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Topco Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may
be permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

351


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, Liens in respect of Specified Assets will be released in connection with a
Specified Asset Disposition.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes
and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Topco Security Document. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any
action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent
and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of
Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security
Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following a public equity offering (an ‘‘IPO Event’’) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with
respect to the release of security if required to implement such IPO Event), Holdco shall be entitled to
require (by written notice to the trustee under the Secured Notes Indenture (a ‘‘Pushdown Notice’’)) that
the terms of the Debt Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant
Pushdown Notice (the ‘‘Pushdown Date’’)) as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
IPO Debt Pushdown.’’

For the purpose of this covenant, the ‘‘IPO Pushdown Entity’’ shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdco
or a Parent Entity of Holdco notified to the trustee under the Secured Notes Indenture by Holdco in
writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event;
_provided, that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdco which will issue shares,_
or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a parent entity of such Restricted
Subsidiary) and, provided further, that (a) if the Topco Notes (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
are not refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date, this section ‘‘IPO Debt Pushdown’’ shall
operate such that (i) for the purposes of the Topco Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or
Topco Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Topco Borrower (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity as determined by the first clause of this
paragraph and the Topco Group (and all related provisions) shall comprise that IPO Pushdown Entity and
its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; and (ii) for the purposes of Holdco and its Restricted
Subsidiaries or Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) other than the Topco Liabilities (and
all related provisions) references to the ‘‘IPO Pushdown Entity’’ shall be construed as reference to the
direct Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity as determined by the first clause of this paragraph and its
Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; or (b) if the Topco Notes have been refinanced in full on or
before the Pushdown Date but the Secured Notes have not been refinanced in full on or before the
Pushdown Date, Holdco shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and except as described under ‘‘—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’ the Notes
are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Company may, at its option, redeem
the Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium with respect to
the Notes as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Company may, at its option, during
each twelve month period following the Issue Date redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of
the Notes (including any Additional Notes), upon giving notice as described under ‘‘—Selection and
Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2024, the Company may, at its option, redeem
an aggregate principal amount of Notes not to exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company
from one or more Equity Offerings or a contribution to the Company’s common share capital made with
the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, at a redemption price equal to % of the

352


-----

principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date; provided that:

(1) the aggregate principal amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes issued under the Indenture (including Additional Notes);

(2) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the
Indenture on the Issue Date (excluding Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the
occurrence of each such redemption (unless all Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently); and

(3) each such redemption occurs not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2024, other than in the event of a Step-up,
the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole or in part, upon notice as described under
‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth
below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but
excluding, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on
of the year indicated below:

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2025, in the event of a One KPI Step-up (that
is not also a Two KPIs Step-Up) as set forth under ‘‘—Interest,’’ the Company may, at its option, redeem
the Notes in whole or in part, upon notice as described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption
price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and

notice as described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to the percentage of

_Other Redemptions Terms_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Company, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such
purchase date, to redeem all Notes, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at
a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such
tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to
any provision of the Indenture regarding Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by
the Company or its Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate

353


-----

principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by
an Affiliate of the Company or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such
determination.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’ below.

Notice of any redemption (other than a Special Mandatory Redemption) of the Notes may, at the
Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an
incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any
redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so
subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition,
and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to
purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole
discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event
that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole
discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or
that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s sole discretion if the Company determines
that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Company may provide in
such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Company’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Company may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and
a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different
provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have
different redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on
the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional
interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Except as described under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ the
Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase
Notes as described under ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock.’’ As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the
Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time
seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments
related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject
to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made
by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured
debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase
transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to
a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading
liquidity of such class or series.

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in

354


-----

connection with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof).

Under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear or Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro
_rata basis (such as by way of a pool factor), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate_
and in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream; provided, however, that no
Book Entry Interest of less than A100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not
held through Euroclear and Clearstream, the Notes will be selected on a _pro rata basis, subject to_
adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption;
_provided, however, that no Note of A100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part_
and only Notes in integral multiples of A1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least
10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at
the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a legal or covenant defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the
Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes
and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the Exchange of any change in the
principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will
be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global
note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an
amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice
(including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed
for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Company may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under ‘‘Withholding Taxes,’’ if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Company determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under ‘‘—Withholding
Taxes’’) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment
or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each
of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

a Payor (as defined below under ‘‘—Withholding Taxes’’) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect
of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased Additional Amounts) with
respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement
cannot be made by the Company or a Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available
to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this
would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or

355


-----

after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a
Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes
and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘Selection and Notice.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts
cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Company or
another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and
(b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a ‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s
interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or
on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments)
such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding
or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been
received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on_
account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place
of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of

356


-----

such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the
Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed
to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or
part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled
to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than
30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474
of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement
relating thereto;

(7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under section 3406 of the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary
or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held
such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such
other reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee
(with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any
Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and
the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to
pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such
Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date).
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

357


-----

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to
any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(in each case, other than in connection with a transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to the extent
of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest
on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through
(3) and (5) through (8) (save that in respect of clause (5), this proviso shall not apply in connection with
transfer, personal property or similar Taxes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to
the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a Change of
Control Offer or (ii) the Company previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a
redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under
this heading ‘‘—Change of Control,’’ the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
(provided that Notes of A100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in
part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after
the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name
the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase
date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a
notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date
specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of
Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating
that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies
certain conditions.

358


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the
Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder
and trigger the Change of Control Offer requirements under the Secured Notes Indenture and other
financing arrangements of a Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may
contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their
right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even
if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of
the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and,
thus, the removal of incumbent management.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur
additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture
will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if
(i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made
by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of
Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the
Indenture as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment
of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to
the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as
to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change
of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, if an event constitutes a Change of Control, the
definitions of Change of Control and Permitted Holders expressly permit a third party to obtain control of
the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a
Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control
Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below
under ‘‘—Certain Covenants.’’

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

(the occurrence of such events, a ‘‘Covenant Suspension Event’’ and the date thereof being referred to as
the ‘‘Suspension Date’’), then, beginning on the Suspension Date until the occurrence of the Reversion
Date (as defined below), (i) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a
specific amount is set out in the Indenture and any definitions used therein (including all ‘‘annual,’’ ‘‘life of
facilities’’, ‘‘fiscal year’’, ‘‘financial year’’, ‘‘calendar year’’, ‘‘at any time’’ and ‘‘aggregate’’ baskets) shall be
increased by fifty (50) per cent and (ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this
offering memorandum will no longer be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

- ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;’’

- the provisions of clause (iv) under ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—Company;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;’’

- ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;’’ and

- ‘‘—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company may not designate any
of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant
protection. In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent
date (the ‘‘Reversion Date’’) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency
withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes below an
Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating
Agency), then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the
Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the
Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’ The
Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a
Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to
zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens
to the extent provided for under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens)
and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as
though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period
(but solely for purposes of the ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ covenant and the ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ and
‘‘Permitted Collateral Liens’’ definitions and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to
exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply
with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; _provided, that (1) with respect to_
Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made
as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption

360


-----

‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period
(including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all
Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued
in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified
to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on
Indebtedness;’’ (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such reinstatement
pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate
Transactions;’’ (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions
from Restricted Subsidiaries;’’ (5) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries’’ after
such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any
Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in
connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to
have been made under clause (i) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments.’’

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or
the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period,
or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension
Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension
Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken
or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Company
and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor,
comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any
Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The
Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the
ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date have occurred,
or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro
_forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either: (i) the Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio is at least 2.00:1.00 or (ii) the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 7.30:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

Credit Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed
the sum of:

(A) the aggregate of:

(1) A million or, if higher, the principal amount of Facility B (EUR) as at the

(C) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test
Date after giving _pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Senior Secured Net Leverage_
Ratio either does not increase as a result or does not exceed 5.10:1.00; plus

(D) the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured on the Collateral that is not Senior Secured
Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test Date after giving _pro forma effect to such_
Incurrence, either:

exceed 6.30:1.00; or

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio either does not decrease as a result or is at least
2.00:1.00; plus

(E) the maximum amount of Indebtedness not secured on Collateral or unsecured such that on
the Applicable Test Date, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, either:

(1) the Total Net Leverage Ratio either does not increase as a result or does not exceed

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio either does not decrease as a result or is at least
2.00:1.00;

_provided that any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness Incurred or_
deemed to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (i) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing
does not exceed the greater of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred pursuant to this clause (i) on the Applicable Test Date for such refinancing and (y) the
aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of
Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and
unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing) and, in the case of a
refinancing of Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR), Facility B (USD) or the Original Revolving
Facility, such Indebtedness shall be treated for all purposes as Incurred pursuant to clause (A)(1),
(A)(2) and (A)(3) above, respectively;

(ii) any (A) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (B) without limiting the covenant set
out under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens,’’ Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or

each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations is permitted by the
terms of the Indenture;

would be permitted to Incur at least A1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
to clause (i)(C) of this paragraph or (y) the Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio would not increase as a result;

(365) days thereafter;

(B) arising out of Sale and Leaseback Transactions; or

For purposes of determining compliance with, and without prejudice to the section ‘‘Financial
Calculations,’’ and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to,
and in compliance with, this covenant:

(i) subject to clause (ii) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is
entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole
discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and will
only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of
such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph of this covenant or one of the
clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need
not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be
permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant
permitting such Indebtedness;

(ii) all Indebtedness under Facility B, the Original Revolving Facility and the Secured Notes, in each
case outstanding as of the Acquisition Closing Date (and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof) shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to:

(A) clause (i)(A)(1) above, in the case of Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR);

(B) clause (i)(A)(2) above, in the case of Indebtedness under Facility B (USD);

(C) clauses (i)(A)(3) above, in the case of Indebtedness under the Original Revolving Facility,
and

(D) clauses (iv)(B)(2) above, in the case of Indebtedness under the Secured Notes,

and the Company shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;

(iii) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a ‘‘cash sweep’’ or
‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of
this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on
the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront
fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(v) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vi) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or
the second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other

similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(viii) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under any facility or enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness, the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any
Applicable Metric for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the
Company’s option (A) on the date of such facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or
(B) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any other
Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the case of (A) and (B) of this clause (viii) that the full amount
thereof (or, at the option of the Company, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date)
and, in either case, if any such Applicable Metric is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the
Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount (excluding any such amount in
respect of Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee
facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility
or ancillary facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement)) permitted to be borrowed or
reborrowed on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (viii) but not actually borrowed on
such date shall be the ‘‘Reserved Indebtedness Amount’’ as of such date for purposes of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of any clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such
clauses);

(ix) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred
to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this covenant or
any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM
EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the
Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be
deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of
accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront
fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;
and

(x) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than
the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof
determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness,
the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
covenant; _provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding_
Indebtedness may (in the Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued
and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in
respect of such Indebtedness and such Increased Amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the
purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
permitted to be Incurred.

368


-----

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Company shall be in
default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness
denominated in a given currency, the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) denominated
in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was incurred, or, at the option of the Company, first committed or first incurred or
upon execution of the definitive documentation in respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Currency
Equivalent); provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in
another currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable currency denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
currency denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) set forth in sub-clause (c) of the definition of ‘‘Refinancing
Indebtedness’’.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

The Company will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company unless such Indebtedness is
also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms, and no
Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness
ranks _pari passu with such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or is also contractually subordinated in right of_
payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; _provided that no_
Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior-priority basis or by virtue of the
application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of the Notes or
where such ranking or subordination arises as a matter of law.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

distributions payable to the relevant Parent Entity to fund interest payments in
respect of Indebtedness of such Parent Entity;

clause (iii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on
Indebtedness’’);

Shareholder Funding) or (y) any payment thereon directly or indirectly for the purpose of funding
any of the payments referred to in clause (i)(C) above); or

Test Date of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of
any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted
Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in
good faith.

-----

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or
otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any of the
Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent
Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a
‘‘direct or indirect’’ action by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company), whether owned on the Acquisition Closing Date or acquired after
that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any
Indebtedness (such Lien, the ‘‘Initial Lien’’), except:

(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral:

(A) Permitted Liens; or

(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Notes and
the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with or prior to, or, in the case of
Liens with respect to Senior Indebtedness, (at the Company’s option) junior to, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured; and

(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the first paragraph of this covenant
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the
Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and/or under the relevant Topco Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the
Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a purchase price in excess
of the greater of (x) CHF 86.2 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty (20) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA, except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least seventy-five (75) per cent. of the
consideration for such Asset Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the
Acquisition Closing Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalent Investments; and provided that the
amount of:

(A) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on
the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in
the footnotes thereto or, if Incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance
sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Company’s or such Restricted

377


-----

Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or
increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the
Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by
their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are (1) assumed by the transferee of any such
assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written agreement
which releases or indemnifies the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such
liabilities or (2) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the
Company acting in good faith to be converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
into Cash Equivalent Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent Investments
received or expected to be received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash
Equivalent Investments within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the closing of
such Asset Disposition; and

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together
with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (C) that
is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) an
amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM EBITDA at the time of the receipt of
such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (or, at the Company’s option, at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalent Investments for purposes of this provision and for no
other purpose; and

(iii) an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset
Disposition is applied, to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
elects (at its sole discretion):

(A) to prepay, repay or purchase:

(1) any Senior Indebtedness; and/or

(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application would comply with the
covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’),

(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash
received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary); and/or

(C) to make any Restricted Payment or Permitted Payment permitted to be made under the
covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or any Permitted
Investment,

in each case, within five hundred and forty-five (545) days from the later of (1) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that:

(1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant
to sub-clause (iii)(A) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire
such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the
case of any asset-based credit facility, any revolving credit facility (including a
Revolving Facility)) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so
prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 545th day
shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of
such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Company, or such Restricted
Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith
expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment

378


-----

or letter of intent within the later of such 545th day and one hundred and eighty
(180) days of such commitment or letter of intent (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’); and

(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in
accordance with sub-clauses (iii)(A) to (iii)(C) above, the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such
Net Available Cash in any manner permitted by the Indenture.

The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Indenture:

(i) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such
Asset Disposition exceeds 6.05:1.00, one hundred (100) per cent of the Net Available Cash from
such Asset Disposition; or

(ii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such
Asset Disposition exceeds 5.80:1.00 but does not exceed 6.05:1.00, fifty (50) per cent. of the Net
Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or

(iii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such
Asset Disposition does not exceed 5.80:1.00, zero (0) per cent of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition;

in each case, provided that:

(A) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase
any amount of Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness at a price of no less
than one hundred (100) per cent. of the principal amount thereof, to the extent the creditors in
respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (including the Holders) or Senior Indebtedness elect not to
tender their Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or
purchase, the Company will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to
such amount not tendered under this clause (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of
Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the fourth
paragraph of this covenant, the ‘‘Declined Proceeds’’); and

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to
clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above shall be immediately available to the Group for any
purposes permitted by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with
clause (xxiv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Restricted
Payments,’’ without regard to the periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

On the 546th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of
an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
under this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) CHF 129.3 million and (y) an amount equal to thirty
(30) per cent. of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company will within ten (10) Business Days
make an offer (an ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by
the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount
equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, the offer price
required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing
such Pari Passu Indebtedness.

The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the
expiration of the relevant five hundred and forty-five (545) days (or such longer period provided above)
(the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer Period’’) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the ‘‘Advance
_Portion’’) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an ‘‘Advance Offer’’)._

379


-----

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the
Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall
prepay, repay or purchase the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata
basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination.
Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds
that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (0) (regardless
of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or
expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess
Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose permitted by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount
offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the
Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance
Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees
(but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such
consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net
Available Cash in any manner permitted by the Indenture.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent
amount determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Secured Notes Indenture may prohibit or limit, and future credit
agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the
Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited
from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes
or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not
obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such
case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the
Indenture.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(x) CHF 43.1 million and (y) an amount equal to ten (10) per cent. of LTM EBITDA unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a

380


-----

comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(x) CHF 64.7 million and (y) an amount equal to fifteen (15) per cent. of LTM EBITDA, the terms
of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company; _provided that any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have_
satisfied the requirements set forth in this clause (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a
majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Company, if any.

(i) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or any Permitted Investment;

Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash

(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the

including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors,
consultants, distributors or employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of

refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent
not more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or related assets in
connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

381


-----

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity which

(A) because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in, or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; or

(B) due to the fact that a director of such person is also a director of the Company or any direct

case may be, on any matter involving such other person);

Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; _provided that such_

performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future
amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the

382


-----

Acquisition Closing Date will only be permitted under this clause to the extent that the terms of any
such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a
whole) in any material respect as determined in good faith by the Company;

(xvi) any purchases by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is

Company’s Affiliates are on the same terms as such purchases by such persons who are not the
Company’s Affiliates;

(xvii) any:

(A) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
(and payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Affiliates in connection

favorable terms; and

(B) payments to Affiliates in respect of securities of the Company or any of the Restricted

terms of such securities;

(xviii) payments by any Parent Entity, the Company and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any tax

(xix) payments, Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock (and cancellation of any thereof) of the Company

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities),
(b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired
by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection with such
transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another
Person is the Successor Company (as defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(v) any encumbrance, restriction or condition: (A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting,
assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract
or agreement, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;
(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under this
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under this

384

Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of
the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;
(C) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or
other agreement to which the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; _provided that such agreement_
prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the
proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or (D) pursuant to
customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal
easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(vi) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions

(xiii) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the covenant
described under ‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness’’ if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Facilities,
together with the Transaction Security Documents associated therewith, or the Secured Notes
Indenture, together with the Transaction Security Documents associated therewith, or the
Indenture, together with the Topco Security Documents associated therewith, and (B) the
Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and where, in the case of this
sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Company determines at the time of entry into such agreement or
instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect,
the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (y) such encumbrance
or restriction applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement or
instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(xiv) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under the covenant

referred to in clauses (i) to (xiv) of this paragraph or this clause (xv) (an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (i) to (xiv) of this paragraph or this clause (xv); _provided, however, that the encumbrances_
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which

385


-----

such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Company).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment
made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments
pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more
clauses of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Payments’’ or ‘‘Permitted Investments,’’ as determined by the
Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if
the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause
a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee on the date of such designation by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that
such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described
under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to
meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be
deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted
to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Indebtedness,’’ the Company will be in default of such covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted_
Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only
be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
Indebtedness’’ (including pursuant to clause (v) of the second paragraph thereof treating such
redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such
designation had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Test Date; and (2) no Event of Default would
be in existence following such designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the
preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
following the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, 150 days) after the end
of each fiscal year of the Company, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021,
annual reports containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at the end
of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of

independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial review of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results
of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company;
(iii) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company,_
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
(other than the Acquisition) that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such _pro forma information has been_
provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2), (3) or (4) of the first paragraph of this
‘‘Reports’’ covenant); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the
extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case
of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description

386


-----

of all material debt instruments and (v) a summary description of material risk factors and material
recent developments; provided that the information described in clause (iv) may be provided in the
footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, 90 days) after the end of
each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, commencing with the
quarter ending June 30, 2021, quarterly financial statements containing the following information:
(i) the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter
and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to
date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior
period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited _pro forma income statement_
and balance sheet information of the Company, together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the
most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro
_forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable_
expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and
material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company and (iv) material recent
developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer
of the Company or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a description of such
event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not
‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under
any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of this Indenture) shall be
prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or
otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except
as may otherwise be described in such information; _provided, however, that the reports set forth in_
clauses (1), (3) and (4) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that
applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the
Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to
U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s _pro forma consolidated_
revenue or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first
paragraph of this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which,
if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it

387


-----

elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and
other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next subsequent paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Company, any current or future company in the Target Group or any Parent Entity or IPO
Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent
regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock Exchange) and the Company, such current or
future company in the Target Group or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and
disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted
to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish
Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock
Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or
the Swiss Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards (or the applicable
standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish
Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock
Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and _provided that such_
requirements require the Company, any current or future company in the Target Group or any Parent
Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the New York
Stock Exchange or the Swiss Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Company will be deemed to have complied
with the provisions contained in this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
‘‘Reports’’ covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity
of the Company so long as such reports (if an annual, half-yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant as if references to
the Company therein were references to such Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated
financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not
the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and
(v) the total consolidated amounts; or (y) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Company (including the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) that
represents substantially all the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (the ‘‘Reporting
_Subsidiary’’) so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the_
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant as if references to
the Company therein were references to the Reporting Subsidiary and (b) include condensed consolidated
financial information together with separate columns for: (i) the Company, (ii) the Reporting Subsidiary
and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Company that are
not the Reporting Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Reporting Subsidiary on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the
requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Any reports in respect of periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date (including in respect
of any comparative information) may, upon the election of the Company, include only the consolidated
financial information of the Target Group without any other financial information, after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions. For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made
under the Indenture, the Company may use financial statements of a predecessor of the Company or the
Target Group for reporting or making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect
to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the
confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances
be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the
other beneficiaries described in the Topco Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest in any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the
covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’; provided, that the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not
prohibited by the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘—Limitation on
Liens’’, including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released
in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture or the Topco Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge,
transfer or release of any Collateral or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the Indenture and the
Topco Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Topco Security Documents may be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) (1) to cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (2) for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens;
(3) to add to the Collateral; (4) to make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect; or (5) to amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise
modify or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the
same assets) any Topco Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization
and/or Permitted Tax Restructuring or a transaction not prohibited by the covenants described under
‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’; _provided, however, that in the case of clauses (4) and (5) above, no Topco_
Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise
modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the
same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement
supplement, replacement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Company delivers to the Security Agent and the
Trustee, either (i) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent
and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international
standing which confirms the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), (ii) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of
the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement,
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets), or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of
Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Topco Security Document, so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a
Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the
Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications)
consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, other
than a Guarantor or a Securitization Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) any syndicated Credit
Facility or (ii) Public Debt of the Company or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of
the greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) 25% of LTM EBITDA at such time, unless such Restricted
Subsidiary within 60 days after the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes and delivers a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Note
Guarantee shall rank senior to or _pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other_
Indebtedness, except that with respect to a guarantee of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any
Guarantor, such Note Guarantee may be expressly subordinated and rank junior in right of payment to
such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness to the same extent as the Note
Guarantees are subordinated to the Senior Indebtedness being guaranteed; _provided that this covenant_
shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any
Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such
Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period described in this paragraph.

At the option of the Company, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the
extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under ‘‘Note
Guarantees—Note Guarantee Releases.’’ A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at
the option of the Company if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with this Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a
Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any
release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other
limitations on the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability
of the Guarantees and the Notes Collateral’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral.’’

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of: (i) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as
otherwise required herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in
sub-clause (i) above, the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the
Security Interests, _provided that: (A) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any_
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or
the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee
or the Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor
Agreement; (B) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative
terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict; and (C) regardless of the number of Intercreditor
Agreements or Additional Intercreditor agreements, only one payment blockage notice may be served in

390


-----

any period of 360 consecutive days or in respect of the same event or circumstance and any such payment
blockages may not be in effect for more than 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day
period.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking
junior to the Notes); (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision
for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes; (vi) implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens; (vii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof; or (viii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to
ensure that the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by first-priority Liens over the Collateral. In
formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The Indenture will also provide that the Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, other than: (i) in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) with the
consent of the requisite majority of Holders except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘—Amendments
and Waivers’’, and the Company may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the
Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect their
respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
requisite majority of Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, provided that such
transaction would comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at
the option of the Company, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Company elects to determine any
Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give _pro forma effect to any other Applicable_
Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; _provided that the_ _pro_
_forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable_
Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that
(a) the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a
more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed
to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as
contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested
at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto.

391


-----

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been
complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such
Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a
result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event
of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due
to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions
will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of
Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’, in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action or_
transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior
to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Company
determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such
Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is
committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in
reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio
based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other
debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility
under the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to paragraph (viii) of the
third paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness’’ any undrawn commitments
for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the
Applicable Metric.

For purposes of determining compliance with (A) any euro-denominated Applicable Metric, the Euro
Equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange
selected by the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange transaction entered into by the Group in relation
to the Applicable Transaction or any rate referred to in paragraph (C) below); (B) any CHF-denominated
Applicable Metric, the CHF equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated
using a rate of exchange selected by the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable
Test Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange transaction entered into
by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction or any rate referred to in paragraph (C) below); or
(C) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio
under the Note Documents), the euro-equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated, at the Company’s option, using any of (i) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates
over the relevant Testing Period; (ii) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial
statements or management accounts; or (iii) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Company
(acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test
Date, if applicable); or (iv) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging
arrangement entered into by any member of the Group, and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or
any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent
change in the euro or CHF equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange
rates.

Without prejudice to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company may, from time to time, by
notice to the Trustee, redenominate any Applicable Metric denominated in a particular currency into CHF,
euro or US dollar (as it may elect) by reference to any rate referred to in clause (C) of the immediately
preceding paragraph and, on and from the date of such notice, such Applicable Metric shall for all
purposes be construed as being denominated in such currency specified by the Company in the amount
determined by the Company in accordance with this paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in this
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or

392


-----

component thereof, the Company shall be permitted to (A) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or
other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from (i) the
Transactions, (ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the Indenture or
the impact from purchase price accounting, (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or
re-branding of existing businesses, (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v) research and development expenditure
(and the capitalization thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with
Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent
measure under the Accounting Principles) or any other changes in the applicable Accounting Principles,
provided that the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases) is either excluded or included consistently in both
Indebtedness and Consolidated EBITDA in any single such calculation; and/or (B) include any addbacks
(without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated Synergies) or costs or
expenses (i) of a type reflected in this offering memorandum and/or any base case model or quality of
earnings report relating to an Investment or acquisition permitted under the Indenture prepared by an
independent third party and/or (ii) taken into account in determining (x) consolidated EBITDA or (y) the
financing EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for an Investment or acquisition permitted
under the Indenture.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the ‘‘numerical
_permission’’) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the ‘‘grower permission’’) and the grower permission of_
the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an acquisition
or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be
increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such
acquisitions and/or investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the
grower permission.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is
incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be
permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based
permission. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant
Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an ‘‘Annual
_Period’’):_

(i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if
positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the
amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the
‘‘Carry Forward Amount’’); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the
immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following
Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the ‘‘Carry Back Amount’’); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against
the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such
Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the
Carry Back Amount.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
to any person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be a person organized
and existing under the laws of England, Luxembourg, United States, Switzerland, a Member State
of the European Union (or any other jurisdiction approved by all of the Holders) and the Successor
Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by way of supplemental indenture, executed
and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the Notes, the

393


-----

Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Topco Security Documents, as applicable;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and:

(A) the Company or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional A1.00
of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Limitation
on Indebtedness;’’ or

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio
would not be higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Security Documents, as
applicable, are legal and binding agreements enforceable against the Successor Company; provided
that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters
of fact; and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially
equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent
concept)) guarantees and security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the
shares (or other interests) in the Company or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets
or shares (or other interests) cease to exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the
Company cease to exist, security will be granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the
shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Company under the Notes and the Indenture.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(i) consolidate with or merge with or into any person;

(ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, to any person; or

(iii) permit any person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction); or

(B) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture and
all obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Topco Security Documents, as applicable, and immediately after giving effect to
the transaction, no Default is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in
each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the
Indenture.

394


-----

_General_

The provisions set forth in this covenant ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to):

(a) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging
or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Company,
a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or a Guarantor;

(b) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and
assets to the Company or a Guarantor;

(c) any consolidation or merger of the Company into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Company is
not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation:

(A) the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Company under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Topco Security Documents and clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of the covenant
described under ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—Company’’ above shall apply to such
transaction; and

(B) to the extent that any Collateral previously granted over the shares in the capital of the
relevant Guarantor would not, in accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the
shares in the capital of the surviving entity, the direct Parent Holding Company of the
surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant Collateral in the form
of Security Interests over the shares in the capital of the surviving entity on substantially
equivalent terms to any Security Interests granted over the shares in the capital of such
predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(d) the Company or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity;
_provided that, in the case of a consolidation, merger or combination of:_

(A) the Company into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of
the covenant described under ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—Company’’ shall apply to such
transaction; and

(B) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, sub-clause (iii) above shall apply to such transaction;
or

(e) the Transactions or any Permitted Transaction.

_Other Merger and Consolidation Terms_

A Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not be deemed to be the sale, assignment, conveyance,
transfer, lease or disposal of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company or one or
more Subsidiaries of the Company, and such Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not be subject to
the covenants described under ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation—Company’’ and this ‘‘Merger and
Consolidation—Guarantors’’ covenant.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict to the
Transactions or the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

**Events of Default**

Subject to the two succeeding paragraphs, each of the following is an Event of Default under the
Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for thirty
(30) days;

395


-----

(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(c) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for sixty (60) days after written notice by the
Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(d) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may
be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by
the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company
or any Significant Subsidiary in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the
date hereof, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a _‘‘payment_
_default’’); or_

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross_acceleration provision’’),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such payment
defaults or accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), is in excess of the
greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA;

(e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Parentco, the Company or a
Significant Subsidiary (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’) which, in each case, are sanctioned by a court
and become unconditional;

(f) failure by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
the greater of (x) CHF 107.8 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA, other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies
issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid,
undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than sixty (60) days (after receipt of notice from
the Agent) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or
decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’);

(g) any Security Interest under the Topco Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of
CHF 43.1 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Topco Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in
full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Topco Security Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall
be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in
writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues
for 10 days (the ‘‘security default provisions’’);

(h) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of any one
or more Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more
Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note
Guarantee (the ‘‘guarantee default provisions’’); and

(i) the failure by the Company to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent
required, as described under ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

However, a Default under clauses (d) or (f) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of
Default unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes have notified the Company of the Default and (ii) the Company has not cured such

396


-----

Default within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice provided that a notice of Default may not be
given with respect to any action taken and reported to the Agent, more than two years prior to such notice
of Default. Notwithstanding any other term of the Note Documents, no Permitted Transaction shall (or
shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in (whether directly or indirectly), a Default or an Event of
Default, and each such event, transaction or arrangement shall be expressly permitted under the terms of
the Note Documents. In addition, notwithstanding any other term of the Note Documents, it will not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default if the Company fails to achieve any Sustainability Performance
Target, or fails to provide any Officer’s Certificate or Assurance Letter with respect to its performance
against the Sustainability Performance Targets, and the sole recourse of Holders in such instance shall be
the right to receive the applicable increase in interest rate, in the manner described under ‘‘—Interest’’ and
the associated change to the optional redemption prices under ‘‘—Optional Redemption.’’

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this
section ‘‘Events of Default’’) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the
Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company
and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall,
declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable
immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (d) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant
to such clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within
thirty (30) days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section ‘‘Events of Default’’
occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Topco Security Documents except as provided in such Topco Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may
only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences
(including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant titled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except
to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

397


-----

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which
a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise
of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that
the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other
Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its
sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing
of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within
60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their
status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the other Note Documents
may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions,
any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of
principal or premium, Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any Note (including in connection with an
offer to purchase), except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture and the other Note Documents may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
Notes).

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (7) of this
paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes, an amendment or waiver may not,
with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other
than provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions
relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption’’ and
‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’;

398


-----

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of,
or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘Withholding Taxes’’ that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms
of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Topco Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Indenture; _provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the provisions_
governing a Change of Control, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests
granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the
consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes) and any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent
of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum
denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the Company
or a Guarantor under any Note Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a
Permitted Reorganization);

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders
or make any change (including changing the ISIN, common code or other identifying number on
any Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material
respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be
issued in compliance with this Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘—Limitation on
Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ to add Note Guarantees with respect to
the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes
when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the

399


-----

Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under any Debt Document of a successor
Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any
Note Document;

(8) in the case of the Topco Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security
Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Indenture, in
any property which is required by the Topco Security Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to
the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person;
_provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited by the Indenture, the_
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described
under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ is complied with;

(9) conform the text of the Indenture, the Topco Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of
this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of the
Senior Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Topco
Security Documents or the Notes;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of
Notes; _provided, however, that (i) compliance with the this Indenture as so amended would not_
result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any
material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ and ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’, relating to
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; and

(13) comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
Agreements’’.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ or this section ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’ shall be
deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or
premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture
by any Holder given in connection with a sale or tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid
by such sale or tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’ to add
a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for
the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Company,
(ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture
need only be duly authorized and executed by the Company, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the
extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company, or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company, will be

400


-----

considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will
be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a responsible officer of the
Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Independent
Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or
under direct or indirect common control with the Company.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of Parentco, the Company and the Guarantors
under the Note Documents (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, the
Topco Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than
with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation’’—The Company) and ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and the
default provisions relating to such covenants described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above, the operation
of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions
(other than with respect to the Company), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision, and
the security default provision described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the
Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (c), (d), (e) (with respect only to
Significant Subsidiaries), (f) or (g) under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in euro or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, for the
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case
may be; _provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the_
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the ‘‘Applicable Premium
_Deficit’’) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any_
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders
and beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of
Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable
U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

401


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be
of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee,
as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company)
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated
Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent in the
name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited, or caused to be deposited with
the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money
in euro or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay
and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of deposit (in the
case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the
case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or
prior to the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit
that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the
Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Company has
delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Company
has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all
conditions precedent under the ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

If requested in writing by the Company to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, the Trustee will distribute any
amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be;
_provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the_
Company of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as
set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other
premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by
accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Lucid Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty. Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to

402


-----

exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder
has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against
any loss, liability or expense.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of
the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to
the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not
eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than
6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. In formulating its decisions, the Trustee and the
Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems
appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

**Notices**

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the
Exchange so require, notices of the Company with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Exchange.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as any
Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and
Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders
of book-entry interests. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream
conflict with any such requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the Indenture if
it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person
by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed
within the time prescribed. Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder
or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is electronically delivered or mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether
or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given through Euroclear or Clearstream, it
is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment
thereof. Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be
prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the required currency (the ‘‘Required Currency’’) of account and payment for all sums payable by
the Company and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees
thereof, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the

403


-----

Required Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Company, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder,
any Paying Agent or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Company or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent
of the amount of the Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If the
amount in that other currency is less than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the
recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee under any Note, the Company and the Guarantors will
indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the
Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be _prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note, or any_
Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Company’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder of a Note, any Paying Agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee,
or to the Trustee. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance
with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the
Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange
will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the
Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Company and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the
United States of America. The Indenture will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will appoint
an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New
York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For
the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the
consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The
Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The Topco Security
Documents will be governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into account any Hedging
Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed
to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by an Officer of the Company to be the rate of interest

computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed

the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness
that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a
eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate
actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

For the purposes of this definition, ‘‘Consolidated Interest Expense’’ will be calculated using an assumed
interest rate based on the indicative interest margin contained in any financing commitment
documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as
reasonably determined by the Company in good faith.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Notes’’). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes representing
the Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘SSN Rule 144A Global Notes’’) will be deposited upon issuance with the
custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the
Rule 144A Global Notes representing the Senior Notes (the ‘‘SUN Rule 144A Global Notes’’) will be
deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of such common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance
on Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global
Notes representing the Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘SSN Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with
SSN Rule 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘SSN Global Notes’’) will be deposited upon issuance with the
custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the
Regulation S Global Notes representing the Senior Notes (the ‘‘SUN Regulation S Global Notes’’ and,
together with SUN Rule 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘SUN Global Notes’’) will be deposited upon issuance
with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of such common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. The Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes
are collectively referred to herein as the ‘‘Global Notes.’’

During the 40-day distribution compliance period, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S or to persons whom the transferor
reasonably believes are ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions
and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’ and, together with
the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with DTC, in the case of the SSN Global Notes, and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the SUN
Global Notes or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be
shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by
DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes
will only be issued in minimum denominations of US$200,000 and in integral multiples of U$1,000 in
excess thereof (in the case of the SSN Global Notes) and minimum denominations of A100,000 and in
integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the SUN Global Notes).

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a
participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities
take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability
to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of
interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical
delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be considered the
registered owners or ‘‘Holders’’ of the Notes under the Indentures for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or common depositary for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the holder of the
Notes for all purposes under the relevant Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of
DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures
of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own
Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indentures.

None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Registrars, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor
any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating
to the Book-Entry Interests.

456


-----

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’):

1. if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the relevant Issuer within 120 days;

2. if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default (as defined under
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ or ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’, as applicable) under the
Indentures; or

3. if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indentures.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuers will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and
such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indentures, unless that
legend is not required by the Indentures or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the relevant Registrar. In the event of a
partial transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered
Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered
Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding
not transferred or redeemed; _provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in minimum_
denominations of US$200,000 and in integral multiples of U$1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a
Definitive Registered Note relating to the Senior Secured Notes) and minimum denominations of A100,000
and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered Note relating to
the Senior Notes).

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the applicable Registrar or at the office of the applicable Transfer Agent, we will issue and
the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive
Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder
requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the
judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent appointed
pursuant to the Indentures from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is
replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
Indentures, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indentures and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the applicable
Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents and the Registrars
and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership
of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the
Issuers, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

457


-----

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC
or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuers
understand that under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot
or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational
procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount (in the
case of the SSN Global Notes) and A100,000 principal amount (in the case of the SUN Global Notes) at
maturity may be redeemed in part. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Notes.’’_

**Payments on the Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuers to the Paying Agents. The Paying
Agents will, in turn, make such payments to DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuers, the Trustee, each Paying Agent, each Transfer Agent, each
Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for
example, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or their respective nominees) as the owner
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the
Issuers, the Trustee, the Registrars, the Transfer Agents, the Paying Agents nor any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant
or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any
such payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the custodian or common depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in
‘‘street name.’’

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the
Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars, the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective agents
will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or
expenses in relation to, or resulting from, any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with
any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax
consequences to them.

458


-----

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the SSN
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. Dollars. The principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the SUN Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that they will take any action permitted to be
taken by a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under
the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for
Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to
their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, transfers
between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be done in accordance with
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds.

If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the
Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities,
such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indentures.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt
by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any
other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and
the closing of the Offering (the ‘‘distribution compliance period’’), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will
be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or persons
who hold interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and any sale or transfer of such
interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made
pursuant to Rule 144A. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to (i) a person who takes
delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning
of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or (ii) otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

Subject to the forgoing, and as set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange.’’ Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global
Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other
Global Note of such series will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned
Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter
be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

In connection with transfers involving exchanges between Regulation S Book-Entry Interests and 144A
Book-Entry Interests, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount

459


-----

of the relevant Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the other relevant
Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and ‘‘Description
_of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the_
Trustee and the relevant Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuers provide the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement
system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the
Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor
any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuers that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking
Law, a ‘‘banking organization’’ within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the
Federal Reserve System, a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform
Commercial Code, and a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’). DTC holds and provides asset
servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money
market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post trade
settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities,
through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts.
DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (‘‘DTCC’’). DTCC is
the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated
subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various
services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that
interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In
addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive
distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s
rules and operating procedures.

460


-----

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars, the Paying Agents nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Senior Secured Notes will be made in U.S. Dollars and initial settlement for the
Senior Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle
in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems
are open for business.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES**

_The following summary describes certain Switzerland, Luxembourg and United States federal income tax_
_consequences for holders of the Notes. This discussion is not intended as tax advice to any particular investor. It_
_is also not a complete analysis or listing of all potential Switzerland, Luxembourg or United States federal_
_income tax consequences related to your investment in the Notes. We urge you to consult your own tax adviser_
_regarding the specific United States federal, state, local, Switzerland, Luxembourg and other tax consequences of_
_an investment in the Notes in your own particular factual circumstances._

**Switzerland**

The following discussion is a summary of certain Swiss tax considerations relating to the acquisition,
holding and disposal of the Notes. It does not aim to be a comprehensive description of all the Swiss tax
considerations that may be relevant for a decision to purchase the Notes. The tax treatment for each
prospective purchaser of the Notes depends on the particular situation and the facts and circumstances of
such prospective purchaser. This does not constitute legal or tax advice. Prospective purchasers of the
Notes investors are strongly advised to consult their own professional advisers in light of their particular
circumstances.

**_Swiss Federal Withholding Tax_**

All payments by the Issuers, of interest on, and repayment of principal of, the Notes will be made without
deduction of Swiss federal withholding tax (Verrechnungssteuer), provided the Issuers are at all times
resident and effectively managed outside Switzerland and provided further that the payment obligations of,
and the use of proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest provided by, a Guarantor or security
provider (as applicable) organized under the laws of Switzerland (each a ‘‘Swiss Guarantor’’) under the
Note Guarantees and the SSN Collateral are at all times limited to a sum equal to the maximum amount of
the respective Swiss Guarantor’s freely disposable equity capital.

Payments under the Note Guarantees and proceeds from enforcement of the security interest in the SSN
Collateral provided by a Swiss Guarantor may be subject to Swiss federal withholding tax (of up to 35% at
current rates, subject to the applicable double-taxation treaties and/or the discharging of the liability to
such tax by notification rather than payment of the tax) to the extent that the payment/security
enforcement proceeds fall to be regarded as a deemed dividend distribution by the respective Swiss
Guarantor to the Issuers or any other related party.

On April 3, 2020, the Swiss Federal Council initiated consultation proceedings on a Swiss federal
withholding tax reform introducing a paying agent system with regard to interest payments. According to
the draft bill, the existing debtor-based regime would have been replaced by a paying agent-based regime
for Swiss federal withholding tax under which interest payments to Swiss entities and foreign investors
would have been exempt from Swiss federal withholding tax. For Swiss resident individuals, Swiss federal
withholding tax would have been applied on interest from domestic as well as foreign investments, such as
the Notes, if held through a Swiss paying agent. However, after the negative outcome of the legislative
consultation with Swiss official and private bodies, the Swiss Federal Council decided on September 11,
2020 to abandon the reform of the Swiss federal withholding tax to a paying agent-based regime. Rather,
the Swiss Federal Council is currently planning to pursue a reform of the Swiss federal withholding tax
regime that would, among other elements, abolish Swiss federal withholding tax on all forms of interest,
except interest on deposits of private individuals resident in Switzerland with Swiss banks. On April 14,
2021, the Swiss Federal Council approved and published the dispatch (Botschaft) for this Swiss federal
withholding tax reform for legislative consultation which is expected to be debated in parliament no earlier
than towards the end of 2021 and, if ultimately, adopted the changes are expected to become effective at
the earliest in 2024.

**_Swiss Federal Stamp Taxes_**

Under the current Swiss federal stamp duty legislation, there are no stamp, issue, registration, transfer or
similar taxes imposed by Switzerland in connection with the issuance or redemption of the Notes.

Secondary market dealings in the Notes where a Swiss domestic bank or a Swiss domestic securities dealer
(as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Duty Act) acts as a party or as an intermediary to the transaction
may be subject to Swiss federal stamp duty on dealing in securities at a rate of up to 0.3 per cent of the
purchase price of the Notes, and further provided that no exemption applies.

**_Income Taxation on Principal or Interest_**

_Notes held by non-Swiss resident holders_

Payments by the Issuers or any Guarantor of interest and repayment of principal to, and gain realized on
the sale or redemption of Notes by, a Noteholder who is not a resident of Switzerland and who during the
relevant taxation year has not engaged in a trade or business through a permanent establishment or a fixed
place of business in Switzerland to which the Notes are attributable and who is not subject to income
taxation in Switzerland for any other reason will not be subject to any Swiss federal, cantonal or communal
income tax.

_Notes held by Swiss resident holders as private assets_

Individuals who are resident in Switzerland and who hold Notes as private assets are required to include all
payments of interest on such Notes in their personal income tax return for the relevant tax period and will
be taxable on any net taxable income for such tax period.

A capital gain, including a gain relating interest accrued realized on the sale or redemption of Notes by
such a Swiss resident holder, is a tax-free private capital gain, and, conversely, a respective loss on the
Bond is a non-tax-deductible private capital loss. However, please see ‘‘—Notes held as Swiss business assets
_and by private individuals classified as professional securities dealers’’ below for the tax treatment of a gain or_
loss realized on Notes held by Swiss resident individuals that are considered ‘‘professional securities
dealers’’.

The above rules regarding Swiss federal income tax normally also apply to Swiss cantonal/municipal
income taxes.

_Notes held as Swiss business assets and by private individuals classified as professional securities dealers_

Individuals who hold Notes as part of a business in Switzerland and Swiss resident corporate taxpayers and
corporate taxpayers resident abroad holding Notes as part of a permanent establishment in Switzerland,
are required to recognize the payments of interest and any gain realized on the sale or redemption of such
Notes (including a gain relating to interest accrued) and any loss on such Notes in their income statement
for the respective tax period and will be taxable on any net taxable earnings for such period. The same
taxation treatment also applies to Swiss resident individuals who, for Swiss income tax purposes, are
classified as ‘‘professional securities dealers’’ for reasons of, inter alia, frequent dealings and leveraged
investments in securities.

**_Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters_**

The Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (the ‘‘AEI’’) is a global initiative led by the
Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development. It aims to establish a universal standard for
automatic exchange of tax information and to increase tax transparency. Jurisdictions that are committed
to implement or have implemented the AEI (such as Switzerland, the European Union member countries
and many other jurisdictions worldwide) require their Reporting Financial Institutions in accordance with
the respective local implementing law to determine the tax residence(s) of their account holders and
controlling persons (as applicable) and, in case of reportable accounts, report certain identification
information, account information and financial information (including the account balance and related
payments such as interest, dividends, other income and gross proceeds) to the local tax authority which will
then exchange the information received with the tax authorities in the relevant reportable jurisdictions.

More specifically, Switzerland has concluded a multilateral AEI agreement with the EU (replacing the EU
savings tax agreement) and has concluded bilateral AEI agreements with several non-EU countries. In
accordance with such multilateral agreements and bilateral agreements and the implementing laws of
Switzerland, Switzerland has begun to exchange data so collected, and such data may include data about
payments made in respect of the Notes.

**_Swiss Facilitation of the Implementation of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (‘‘FATCA’’)_**

Switzerland has concluded an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. to facilitate the implementation
of FATCA. The agreement ensures that the accounts held by U.S. persons with Swiss financial institutions
are disclosed to the U.S. tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or by means of group
requests within the scope of administrative assistance. Information will not be transferred automatically in

463


-----

the absence of consent, and instead will be exchanged only within the scope of administrative assistance on
the basis of the double taxation agreement between the U.S. and Switzerland. On October 8, 2014, the
Swiss Federal Council approved a mandate for negotiations with the U.S. on changing the current directnotification-based regime to a regime where the relevant information is sent to the Swiss Federal Tax
Administration, which in turn provides the information to the U.S. tax authorities.

**Luxembourg Taxation**

The following is a summary of certain Luxembourg tax considerations relating to the acquisition, holding,
disposal or redemption of the Notes; it is not a substitute for tax advice. It does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes, whether in Luxembourg or elsewhere and
does not address all tax considerations that might be relevant to a particular holder’s or purchaser’s
decision to acquire, hold or dispose of Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own
tax advisers as to which countries’ tax laws could be relevant to acquiring, holding and disposing of the
Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes and the
consequences of such actions under the tax laws of Luxembourg. This summary is based on laws,
regulations, practice and decisions currently in effect in Luxembourg, which may change in each case. Any
of these are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. The information contained within this
section is limited to taxation issues, and prospective investors should not apply any information set out
below to other areas, including (but not limited to) the legality of transactions involving the Notes.

**_Taxation of the Issuers_**

The Issuers are Luxembourg fully taxable companies subject to corporate income tax, solidarity surcharge
and municipal business tax (‘‘Corporation Taxes’’) as well as net wealth tax.

The Issuers have full treaty access and benefits from all EU directives.

Interest expenses are in principle deductible from the taxable basis of the Issuers but could be limited.

For instance, interest expenses directly connected to an exempt participation, and certain write-offs
thereon, are tax-deductible in a given year to the extent that they exceed exempt income (dividends and
gains) from the participation in the same year.

Furthermore, exceeding borrowing costs are only deductible up to 30% of the Issuers’ tax EBITDA
(earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) or EUR3 million. Exceeding borrowing costs
are interest and other costs equivalent to interest on all forms of debt, and expenses incurred in connection
with the raising of finance that exceeds the Issuer’s taxable interest income and other income equivalent to
interest.

Finally, under the Luxembourg law implementing Directive 2017/952/EU of 29 May 2017 (ATAD II), as
from January 1, 2020, the deductibility of the Issuers’ interest payment under the Notes could be denied if
it results in a hybrid mismatch outcome falling into the scope of ATAD II.

**_Withholding Tax_**

All payments made by the Issuers as a consequence of the holding, disposal or redemption of the Notes
can be made free and clear of withholding tax.

However, according to the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the ‘‘Relibi Law’’), a 20%
withholding tax (‘‘20% WHT Discharge’’) applies on savings income paid or secured by a paying agent
established in Luxembourg for the immediate benefit of Luxembourg resident individual holders of the
Notes. The 20% WHT Discharge also applies on accrued or capitalized interest received upon disposal,
redemption, repurchase or conversion of the Notes. Responsibility for the 20% WHT Discharge is
assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of the Relibi Law, including the Issuers, to
the extent it qualifies as a Luxembourg paying agent. The 20% WHT Discharge will operate a full
discharge of income tax for Luxembourg resident individual holders of the Notes acting in the course of
the management of their private wealth.

In the event that interest is paid to Luxembourg resident individual holders of the Notes by a paying agent
established in a Member State (other than Luxembourg) or a Member State of the EEA, the Luxembourg
resident individual holders of the Notes may opt to self-declare and pay a 20% tax in full discharge of
income tax in accordance with the Relibi Law (the ‘‘20% Tax Discharge’’).

464


-----

**_Taxation of the holders of the Notes_**

_Luxembourg Resident holders of the Notes_

_Individual holder of the Notes_

A Luxembourg resident individual Noteholder is subject to Luxembourg personal income tax levied at
progressive rates with respect to interest income received from the Notes unless the 20% WHT Discharge
or the 20% Tax Discharge applies.

A gain (other than interest) realized by an individual Noteholder, acting in the course of the management
of his/her private wealth, upon the sale or disposal in any form whatsoever of the Notes is not subject to
Luxembourg progressive income tax, unless the sale or disposal of the Notes precedes the acquisition of
the Notes or takes place less than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such
gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income may be subject to the 20% WHT Discharge or
the 20% Tax Discharge.

Individual holders of the Notes are not subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax.

_Corporate holder of the Notes_

Resident corporate holders of the Notes must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption
premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever of
the Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

A fully taxable resident corporate holder of the Notes will in principle be subject to Corporation Taxes, in
respect of interest income or gain derived from the Notes.

Luxembourg corporate resident holders of the Notes which benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for
example, (i) undertakings for collective investment subject to the law of 17 December 2010 relating to
undertakings for collective investments, (ii) specialized investment funds subject to the law of 13 February
2007 relating to specialized investment funds, (iii) reserved alternative investment funds (not opting for the
treatment as a venture capital vehicle for Luxembourg tax purposes) subject to the law of 23 July 2016
relating to reserved alternative investment funds or (iv) family wealth management companies subject to
the law of 11 May 2007 relating to family wealth management companies, are exempt from Corporation
Taxes in Luxembourg and are instead subject to an annual subscription tax (taxe d’abonnement).

The Notes shall be part of the taxable net wealth of the Luxembourg resident corporate holder of the
Notes subject to net wealth tax levied on a yearly basis at a rate of 0.5%. A reduced rate of 0.05% is
available for the part of the net wealth exceeding EUR 500,000,000.

Luxembourg corporate resident holders of the Notes which benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for
example, (i) undertakings for collective investment subject to the law of 17 December 2010 relating to
undertakings for collective investments, (ii) vehicles governed by the law of 22 March 2004 on
securitization, (iii) companies governed by the law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles,
(iv) specialized investment funds subject to the law of 13 February 2007 relating to specialized investment
funds, (v) reserved alternative investment funds subject to the law of 23 July 2016, relating to reserved
alternative investment funds or (vi) family wealth management companies subject to the law of 11 May
2007 relating to family wealth management companies, or (vii) a professional pension institution governed
by the law of 13 July 2005 on institutions for occupational retirement provision in the form of pension
savings companies with variable capital and pension savings associations are exempt from net wealth tax.

A minimum net wealth tax may however be due under certain circumstances by certain resident corporate
holders of the Notes.

_Non-Resident holders of the Notes_

A non-resident holder of the Notes, not having a fixed place of business, a permanent establishment or
permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable, is, in principle, not subject
to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under
the Notes or on gain realized on the sale or disposal in any form whatsoever of the Notes nor to net wealth
tax.

A non-resident Noteholder having a fixed place of business, a permanent establishment or permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg taxation on

465


-----

interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the Notes and on any gains
realized upon the sale or disposal in any form whatsoever of the Notes as set forth above for a Luxembourg
resident corporate Noteholder.

**_Other Taxes_**

Neither the issuance nor the transfer of the Notes will give rise to any Luxembourg stamp duty, value
added tax, issuance tax, registration tax, transfer tax or similar taxes or duties, provided that the relevant
issue or transfer agreement is not registered in Luxembourg, which registration is not mandatory.

No Luxembourg value added tax is levied with respect to any payment made in consideration of the
issuance of the Notes, any payment of interest, any repayment of principal or upon redemption and any
transfer of the Notes.

No inheritance tax is levied on the transfer of the Notes upon death of the holder of the Notes in cases
where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes. Where the holder of
the Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes will be
included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax purposes.

**_Residence_**

A holder of the Notes will not become resident, or deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only
of holding the Notes or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the Notes.

**_Common Reporting Standard_**

_CRS_

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (‘‘OECD’’) has developed a common
reporting standard (‘‘CRS’’) to achieve a comprehensive and multilateral automatic exchange of
information on a global basis. A number of jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) signed the OECD’s
multilateral competent authority agreement (‘‘Agreement’’) to automatically exchange information under
the CRS.

The CRS requires certain financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which
may include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due
diligence procedures. A jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement may provide this information to other
jurisdictions that have signed the Agreement.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to
any financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made.

Holder of Notes should consult their professional advisors on the individual impact of CRS.

_DAC6_

On 25 May 2018, the EU Council adopted a directive (2018/822/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU as
regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation) that imposes a reporting
obligation on parties involved in transactions that may be associated with aggressive tax planning
(‘‘DAC6’’). DAC6 has been implemented in Luxembourg by the law of 25 March 2020 (the ‘‘DAC 6 Law’’).

More specifically, the reporting obligation will apply to cross-border arrangements that satisfy one or more
‘‘hallmarks’’ provided for in DAC6, some of them being subject to a gateway criterion, known as the ‘‘Main
Benefit Test’’ (the ‘‘Reportable Arrangements’’).

In the case of a Reportable Arrangement, the information that must be reported includes the name of all
relevant taxpayers and intermediaries as well as an outline of the Reportable Arrangement, the value of
the Reportable Arrangement and identification of any member states likely to be concerned by the
Reportable Arrangement.

The reporting obligation in principle rests with the persons that design, market, organize or make available
for implementation or manage the implementation of the Reportable Arrangement or provide assistance
or advice in relation thereto (the so-called ‘‘intermediaries’’). However, in certain cases, the taxpayer itself
can be subject to the reporting obligation.

466


-----

Starting from January 1, 2021, Reportable Arrangements must be reported within thirty days from (i) the
day after the Reportable Arrangement is made available for implementation or (ii) the day after the
Reportable Arrangement is ready for implementation or (iii) the day when the first step in the
implementation of the Reportable Arrangement has been made.

The information reported will be automatically exchanged between the tax authorities of all Member
States.

In light of the broad scope of DAC6 and DAC 6 Law, transactions carried out by the Company may fall
within the scope of DAC6 and DAC 6 Law and thus be reportable.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary based on present law of certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion addresses
only U.S. Holders (as defined below) who purchase Notes in the offering at the original offering price,
hold Notes as capital assets and use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This discussion is not a
complete description of all U.S. tax considerations relating to purchase, ownership and disposition of a
Note. It does not address the tax treatment of prospective purchasers subject to special rules, such as banks
and certain other financial institutions, dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to
mark-to-market, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, investors required to take certain amounts into income no
later than the time such amounts are reflected on their audited financial statements, U.S. expatriates,
tax-exempt entities, pass-through entities (including partnerships and S-corporations) or persons holding
Notes as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other integrated financial transaction. It also does not
address the tax treatment of U.S. Holders that will hold Notes in connection with a permanent
establishment or fixed base outside of the United States. This summary also does not address U.S. federal
taxes other than the income tax (such as the Medicare surtax on net investment income or estate or gift
taxes) or U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax laws or considerations.

**EACH PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE FROM ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS**
**ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER ITS OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF**
**INVESTING IN NOTES UNDER THE LAWS OF LUXEMBOURG, THE UNITED STATES AND ITS**
**CONSTITUENT JURISDICTIONS AND ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE THE PURCHASER**
**MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION.**

For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other business entity
treated as a corporation) that is organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia, (iii) a trust subject to the control of a U.S. person and the primary supervision of a
U.S. court or (iv) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or an entity or arrangement treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that acquires, owns or disposes of a Note generally will
depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective investor that is a
partnership should consult its own advisors about the tax consequences for its partners of the acquisition,
ownership or disposition of a Note.

**Characterization of the Notes**

All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed prior to their stated maturity at redemption prices equal to
100% of the principal amount of the relevant Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date and additional amounts, if any, plus either (i) a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium or (ii) a premium
over their principal amount, as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional
_Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption.’’ In addition, upon the_
occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or
the Senior Notes, as applicable, will have the right to require the SSN Issuer or the SUN Issuer, as
applicable, to offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, at a
purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control.’’ The rules applicable to debt_

467


-----

instruments with payment contingencies are unclear. In general, if the amount or timing of any payment on
a debt instrument is contingent and the amount or the contingency is neither remote nor incidental, the
debt instrument could be subject to special rules that apply to contingent payment debt instruments
(‘‘CPDIs’’). Each Issuer intends to take the position that the occurrence of such events is remote and that,
therefore, the possibility of such payments does not result in the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes,
as applicable, being treated as CPDIs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each Issuer’s position is
binding on a U.S. Holder unless such holder discloses that it is taking a contrary position on a statement
attached to its tax return in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Each Issuer’s
position is not, however, binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’), and if the IRS were
successfully to assert, and a court were to sustain, a contrary position, all stated interest received by U.S.
Holders would generally be treated as original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) with the result that a U.S. Holder
may be required to accrue OID on the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, prior to
receipt of or in excess of stated interest and gain realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of the
Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, would be treated as ordinary income rather than
as capital gain. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as CPDIs.
Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the treatment of the
Notes as CPDIs.

**Interest**

It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will be issued with no more than a de minimis
amount of OID. Interest on the Notes, including any tax withheld therefrom and Additional Amounts paid
in respect of such withholding, if any, generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder in
accordance with its regular method of tax accounting. The interest generally will be ordinary income from
sources outside the United States. Subject to applicable limitations, a U.S. Holder may claim a deduction
or a foreign tax credit only for tax withheld at the appropriate rate.

A cash basis U.S. Holder receiving stated interest in euros must include in income a U.S. dollar amount
based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt whether or not the payment is converted to U.S.
dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder generally must include in income a U.S. dollar amount based on the
average exchange rate during the accrual period (or, for an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the
partial accrual period within each taxable year). An accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to translate
accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot exchange rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last
day of the first taxable year for the initial portion of an accrual period that spans two taxable years) or, with
respect to interest received within five business days of the last day of an interest accrual period, the spot
exchange rate on the date of receipt. Currency translation elections apply to all debt instruments that the
electing U.S. Holder holds or acquires, and they cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

Upon receipt of a payment in euros (including, upon sale of a Senior Note, the receipt of proceeds which
include accrued, unpaid interest previously included in income), U.S. Holders that have accrued interest
will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to any difference between the U.S. dollar amount
accrued and the U.S. dollar value of the payment received at the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt.
Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

For purposes of this discussion, the ‘‘spot exchange rate’’ generally means a rate that reflects a fair market
rate of exchange available to the public for currency under a ‘‘spot contract’’ in a free market and involving
representative amounts. A ‘‘spot contract’’ is a contract to buy or sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar
on or before two business days following the date of the execution of the contract. If such a spot exchange
rate cannot be demonstrated, the IRS has the authority to determine the spot exchange rate. The ‘‘average
rate’’ for an accrual period (or partial period) is the average of the spot exchange rates for each business
day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derived and consistently
applied by a U.S. Holder.

**Disposition**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on a sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount
realized (less any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not
previously included in income) and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a
(i) Senior Secured Note will generally be the amount paid for the Senior Secured Note and (ii) Senior
Note will generally be its purchase price as determined at the U.S. dollar value of the euros used to

468


-----

purchase it at the spot exchange rate on the purchase date (or, if the Senior Notes are traded on an
established securities exchange and the holder is a cash basis or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder, the
settlement date), less the U.S. dollar value of any payments previously received by the holder (other than
payments of stated interest).

Gain or loss recognized on a disposition of a Note will generally be treated as from U.S. source and will,
except to the extent of any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to a Senior Note, be capital gain or
loss. Payments that are attributable to accrued interest, if any, will be treated as discussed above under
‘‘—Interest.’’ Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the
Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder’s long-term capital
gain may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.

A U.S. Holder that receives currency other than U.S. dollars upon sale, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Senior Note will realize an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the currency
on the date of sale. If the Senior Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S.
Holder or electing accrual basis taxpayer will determine the amount realized on the settlement date. A
U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the currency equal to the U.S. dollar amount realized. Any gain or loss
realized by a U.S. Holder on a subsequent conversion of currency for U.S. dollars will generally be U.S.
source ordinary income or loss. Any foreign currency gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder generally will
be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on sale or other taxable disposition of
a Senior Note equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Senior
Note on the date of acquisition and the date of disposition (or, if the Senior Notes are traded on an
established securities exchange and the U.S. Holder is a cash basis or an electing accrual basis holder, the
settlement date). In addition, upon the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior Note, a
U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Interest.’’ Foreign
currency gain or loss cannot exceed overall gain or loss realized on a disposition of the Senior Note.
Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**Deemed Disposition on IPO Debt Pushdown**

In connection with a public equity offering (an ‘‘IPO Event’’), an Issuer may issue a notice to the relevant
Trustee (a ‘‘Pushdown Notice’’) requiring that, among other matters, the terms of the relevant Debt
Documents shall operate with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice on the basis
that references to the relevant Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply
only to the relevant IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO
_Debt Pushdown’’ and in ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown’’) and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries from time to time, including that each reference in the Indentures or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the relevant Issuer shall be deemed to be a
reference to such IPO Pushdown Entity (such change in terms, an ‘‘IPO Debt Pushdown’’). See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—IPO
_Debt Pushdown.’’_

Such change in the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of the originally issued Notes for new Notes, which would generally be treated as a taxable
exchange for such purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any
gain or loss as described above under ‘‘—Disposition.’’

Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the new Notes deemed issued in such a deemed
exchange could be treated as issued with OID. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include
the OID in their income as it accrues. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S.
federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in connection with the
IPO Debt Pushdown.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.**

Payments of interest and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of a Note may be
reported to the IRS unless the holder is a corporation or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption.
Backup withholding may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the holder fails to provide an accurate
taxpayer identification number or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S.

469


-----

federal income tax returns. A holder can claim a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability for the
amount of any backup withholding and a refund of any excess.

Certain rules may require individual U.S. Holders to report to the IRS information with respect to Notes
not held through an account with certain financial institutions. Investors who fail to report required
information could become subject to substantial penalties. Potential investors should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules for their investment in Notes.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE
INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**European Union**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018, the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’) was published in the
Official Gazette of the European Union. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings
that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

**_Main insolvency proceedings_**

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union
(other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The ‘‘centre of main
interests’’ (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation, the ‘‘EIR COMI’’) is defined as ‘‘the place where
the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third
parties’’. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the EIR COMI of a company or legal
person is presumed to be located in the EU member state of the registered office in the absence of proof
to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another
EU member state within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings.

The European Court of Justice has held that the presumption that a company’s EIR COMI is in the place
of its registered office can only be rebutted if factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third
parties (meaning that they are already in the public domain and what a typical third party would learn as a
result of dealing with the company, without making specific enquiries) indicate that the company’s EIR
COMI is elsewhere (Re _Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/04). Factors which may be taken into account_
include the location of any regulatory authorities and the places where the company’s business is managed
and operated, board meetings are held and the accounts are prepared and audited

The EU Insolvency Regulation specifically states in the Recitals (Recital 30) that the presumption of the
EIR COMI being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central
administration is located in a member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where
a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by
third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of
its interests is located in that other member state. In this regard, special consideration should be given to
creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event
of a shift in the EIR COMI, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the
debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in

471


-----

commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate
means).

Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as
its registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the
presumption cannot be rebutted (Interedil Srl (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil Srl and another
C-396/09).

If the EIR COMI of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member
state (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to
the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the EU member state
within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall
have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked
with them, such as avoidance actions.

Pursuant to Article 7 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the law applicable to insolvency proceedings and
their effects shall be that of the EU member state within the territory of which such proceedings are
opened. In exception thereto regarding third party’s rights in rem, such as rights securing debt obligations
like pledges, assignment of claims or land charges, pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation
the opening of insolvency proceedings shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in
respect to both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to
time, belonging to the debtor, which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time
of the opening of proceedings. Therefore, the EU member state’s jurisdiction governing such right in rem
as the law of the place of location continues to apply. Actions for voidness, voidability or unenforceability
are not precluded.

**_Secondary insolvency proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one EU member state (other than Denmark) under the EU Insolvency
Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU member states (other than Denmark), although
secondary proceedings may be opened in other EU member states. If the EIR COMI of a debtor is in one
EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts
of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ‘‘secondary’’ or ‘‘territorial’’
insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such
other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the
EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings.
Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of
main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the
main proceedings. ‘‘Establishment’’ is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has
carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings
are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU member state.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member
state in which the company has its EIR COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings
can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either:
(a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s EIR COMI
is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at
the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such establishment
or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective EU member state’s
law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main
or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by
the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the_
respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court
of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in
another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state),

472


-----

subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU
member state or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open
insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another EU
member state by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the EU member state in
which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner
must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from
which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the EU member state
where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a
qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If
approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary
insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the
general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may
stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided
that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request
from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three
months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process
of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings
will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be
challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation is not applicable on third party’s rights in rem if and to the
extent rights in rem of third parties or creditors in assets belonging to the debtor exist, which are situated
within the territory of a Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings are opened, hence the
law in such jurisdictions, the lex fori concursus secondarii, becomes applicable on those rights in rem.

**_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_**

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event
that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened.
Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with
any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the
extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also
cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another
member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration
of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of
interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not
incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

**England and Wales**

_Matters relating to the UK Guarantors_

One of the Issue Date Guarantors and certain of the prospective Post-Closing Guarantors are companies
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the ‘‘UK Guarantors’’ and each a ‘‘UK Guarantor’’).
Each UK Guarantor’s registered office is also located in England and Wales. Therefore any insolvency
proceedings in respect of the UK Guarantors would likely be commenced in England and conducted in
accordance with the requirements of English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the

473


-----

relevant proceedings. The scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency (and
restructuring) proceedings available in England and Wales, further detail is set out below. To the extent
that any of the UK Guarantors has any assets and/or creditors in any overseas jurisdictions and enters into
insolvency proceedings in England, recognition of those proceedings in such other jurisdictions is likely to
be a relevant consideration. Such recognition would be a matter for the private international law of the
relevant jurisdictions.

However, insolvency proceedings in relation to the UK Guarantors could also be opened in a country
other than England and Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the jurisdiction in
which those insolvency proceedings were to be commenced. By way of example, where a debtor has its EIR
COMI in a member state of the EU, then (and subject to certain exceptions), insolvency proceedings in
relation to that debtor could be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that
EU member state.

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales such proceedings
could be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such foreign proceedings would not benefit from
automatic recognition in England, although the foreign officeholder could apply under the Model Law
Regulations (see below), which provide that foreign insolvency proceedings may be recognized in England
where a company has its center of main interest (as that concept is used in the Model Law Regulations) or
an ‘‘establishment’’ (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with
human means and assets) in such foreign jurisdiction (see—’’Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006’’
below).

It is therefore not possible to say with certainty where insolvency proceedings will be brought.

_Matters in relation to other Guarantors_

The English courts have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings not only in respect of a debtor that is
incorporated in England and Wales (such as the UK Guarantors). The English courts may have jurisdiction
to open insolvency proceedings in respect of a foreign (i.e. non UK) entity in relation to specific insolvency
proceedings (these are set out more fully below, but by way of example, the English courts may have
jurisdiction to place foreign companies into compulsory liquidation as an unregistered company).

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales, such foreign
proceedings would not benefit from automatic recognition in England, although the foreign officeholder
could apply under the Model Law Regulations (see below), which provide that foreign insolvency
proceedings may be recognized in England where a company has its center of main interest (as that
concept is used in the Model Law Regulations) or an ‘‘establishment’’ (being a place of operations where it
carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets) in such foreign jurisdiction
(see—’’Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006’’ below).

It is therefore not possible to say with any certainty where insolvency proceedings in respect of any entity
will be brought.

**_Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006_**

The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the ‘‘Model Law Regulations’’) provide that the
UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency (the ‘‘Model Law’’) has the force of law in Great
Britain, subject to certain modifications. For current purposes, the relevance of the Model Law
Regulations is in allowing assistance to be sought in Great Britain by a foreign court or a foreign
representative in connection with foreign insolvency proceedings. This may be relevant to the extent that
the UK Guarantors have non-UK assets and/or foreign creditors which may be subject to foreign
proceedings or to the extent that the Issuers or any of the non-UK Guarantors which may be subject to
foreign proceedings have a UK presence.

The Model Law Regulations provide for the recognition of two types of foreign insolvency proceedings
(defined to be collective judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim
proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the
company are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganization or
liquidation): (i) ‘‘foreign main proceedings’’, which can be opened in the state in which the company has its
‘‘centre of main interests’’ (which is subject to a rebuttable presumption that the company’s registered
office is the center of the company’s main interests and it should be noted that the ‘‘centre of main
interests’’ for the purposes of the Model Law Regulations may be different from the ‘‘centre of main

474


-----

interests’’ of an entity for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation); and (ii) ‘‘foreign non-main
_proceedings’’, which can be opened in the state in which the company possesses an ‘‘establishment’’_
(defined as any place of operations where the company carries out a non-transitory economic activity with
human means and assets or services).

A foreign representative (defined to be a person or body, including one appointed on an interim basis,
authorized in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganization or the liquidation of the company’s
assets or affairs or to act as a representative of the foreign proceeding) appointed in a foreign main
proceeding or foreign non-main proceeding is entitled to apply to commence a proceeding under British
insolvency law (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) if the conditions for commencing such a
proceeding are otherwise met.

A foreign representative may apply to the court for recognition of the foreign proceeding in which the
foreign representative has been appointed. From the time of filing of such an application until the time the
application is decided upon, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative and where relief is
urgently needed to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors, grant relief of a
provisional nature. Such relief may include staying execution against the company’s assets, entrusting the
administration or realization of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign
representative or another person designated by the court, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or
otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of
evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or
liabilities and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder
(as defined in the Model Law Regulations) under the law of Great Britain, including any relief provided
under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 (the ‘‘IA86’’).

Upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, commencement or continuation of individual actions or
individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities and execution
against the company’s assets are stayed and the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
assets of the company is suspended. Any such stay and suspension does not affect any right to take any
steps to enforce security over the company’s property or of a creditor to set off its claim against a claim of
the company, provided that such right would have been exercisable if the company had been made the
subject of a winding-up order under the IA86.

Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or non-main, where necessary to protect the
assets of the company or the interests of the creditors the court may, at the request of the foreign
representative, grant any appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation, staying the
commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s
assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, staying execution against the company’s assets, suspending the right
to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of
witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs,
rights, obligations or liabilities entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the company’s
assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court,
extending relief of a provisional nature previously granted and the granting of any additional relief that
may be available to a British insolvency officeholder under the law of Great Britain, including any relief
provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the IA86.

In addition, upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative has standing to make an
application to the court for an order under or in connection with (among others) sections 238, 239, 244,
245 and 423 of the IA86 (see below at ‘‘Antecedent Transaction Laws’’). For such purpose, certain time
periods and notice periods specified in such sections shall be determined by reference to the date of the
opening of the foreign proceeding or the date on which a person has notice of the opening of the relevant
foreign proceedings as provided in the Model Law Regulations. Where such an application is made, then
those sections (together with ancillary sections of the IA86 relating thereto) shall apply whether or not the
company is being wound-up or is in administration under British insolvency law.

**_The Insolvency Test_**

The IA86 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept of a company’s
‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the IA86,
the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the
following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a
statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has

475


-----

failed for three weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor;
(ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due;
or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the
amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (among others), no petition for the
winding up of a registered company may be presented under section 124 of the IA86 on or after 27 April
2020 to 30 June 2021 (the ‘‘Relevant Period’’) on the basis of a statutory demand served between 1 March
2020 and 30 June 2021.

A creditor may not present a petition under section 124 during the Relevant Period for the winding up of a
registered company on a ground specified in section 123(1)(a) to (d) of the IA86 unless the creditor has
reasonable grounds for believing that (i) coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company, or
(ii) the facts by reference to which the relevant ground applies would have arisen even if coronavirus had
not had a financial effect on the company. A creditor may also not present a petition under section 124
during the Relevant Period for the winding up of a registered company on a ground specified in
section 123(1)(e) or (2) of the IA86 unless the creditor has reasonable grounds for believing that
(i) coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company; or (ii) the relevant ground would apply even
if coronavirus had not had a financial effect on the company.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England may be initiated in a number of ways and by
different parties depending on the process (see below for further detail on each process).

**_Administration_**

A company can enter into administration if the company: (i) is registered under the Companies Act 2006
(‘‘CA 2006’’) in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) is incorporated in an EEA State; or (iii) is not
incorporated in an EEA State but has its center of main interests (as defined in the IA86) (‘‘COMI’’) in an
EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK.

There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court
followed by a court order for administration (the ‘in-court route’); or (ii) the filing of certain forms with
the court following which the administration takes effect (the ‘out-of-court route’). The in-court route is
commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its
creditors including contingent or prospective creditors and, where applicable, the Financial Conduct
Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court
method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying
floating charge (‘‘QFC’’) (see below for the meaning of this term)). No physical court hearing is required
and the administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an
instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower the
holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company.
A person is the holder of a QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by
charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the
company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the
in-court or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become,
unable to pay its debts (see ‘‘The Insolvency Test’’ above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed,
the administrator will need to consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of
the following statutory objectives can be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first
objective is not reasonably practicable and similarly for the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a
going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company
were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii) to realize property to make a distribution to
one or more secured or preferential creditors (see ‘‘Statutory order of priorities’’ below). In order to make
an order, the court must be satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the administration will achieve one or
more of these purposes.

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in
administration. Additionally, even where no interim moratorium was previously in effect, a company will
nevertheless gain the benefit of the moratorium once in administration. The moratorium means, among

476


-----

other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or continued against the
company (creditors cannot enforce their claims against the company to recover debts, for example) and no
step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property, no administrative receiver can be
appointed, no resolution can be passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited
circumstances, no order can be made for the winding-up of the company (in each case except with the
consent of the administrator or the permission of the court). This moratorium does not apply to financial
collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the ‘‘Financial
**Collateral Regulations)’’ (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such**
as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims). During the administration
of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial
collateral arrangements) without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an
administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all
property to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal
with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security
(where powers are more restricted). The permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed
charge assets, such permission will only be granted if: (i) disposing of the property in question is likely to
promote the administration’s purpose; and (ii) the net proceeds of sale, plus any additional amount
required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net
amount which would be realized on a sale of property at market value, are applied towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to
investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or
former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see ‘‘Antecedent Transaction Laws’’ below in
respect of the latter).

An administrator may make distributions to unsecured creditors with permission of the court and in doing
so they will follow a statutory order of priority set out in legislation (see ‘‘Statutory order of priorities’’
below).

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and an administrator does not have the power to
disclaim contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the
best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured
debt—see ‘‘Statutory order of priorities’’ below).

Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms
providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the occurrence of
an insolvency event (including administration) will generally be suspended for the duration of the relevant
insolvency procedure (see ‘‘Supplier Contracts’’ below).

**_Administrative receivership_**

Section 72A(1) of the IA86 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s property may not
appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections 72B to
72GA.

Pursuant to section 72B of the IA86, the first exception to this general prohibition is in the context of
capital markets. There are three limbs that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for this exception: (i) the
appointment is in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement; (ii) a
party incurs, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50 million
under the arrangement; and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment.

Each of the above three limbs is considered further below.

Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an arrangement is a capital market arrangement if:
(i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds a capital
market investment issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who issues a
capital market investment; or (C) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement
in connection with the issue of a capital market investment; or (D) a person who holds the security as
trustee for a party to the arrangement who agrees to provide finance to another party; or (ii) at least one
party guarantees the performance of obligations of another party; or (iii) at least one party provides
security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another party; or (iv) it involves an investment

477


-----

of a kind described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated
Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contracts for differences (the
‘‘Regulated Activities Order’’).

Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the IA86 states that a party to an arrangement includes a party to an
agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the
arrangement, or is necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. We note that there is no
statutory definition or case law on the meaning of the term ‘‘arrangement’’, however it is clear that an
arrangement can be more than just one agreement and in our view the term is apposite to describe a series
of inter-related transactions.

Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, the requirement to incur debt of at least £50 million
may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be expressed wholly
or partly in foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at the time when
the arrangement is entered into).

Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an investment is a capital market investment if it:
(i) is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or traded or
designed to be rated, listed or traded.

The Senior Secured Notes meet the criteria to qualify for the capital markets exemption pursuant to
section 72B of the IA86. To the extent the Security Trustee is the holder of a QFC, it will be empowered to
appoint an administrative receiver.

To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a QFC must execute a document
appointing an administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document pursuant to
which the QFC was created. This appointment document must then be delivered to the proposed
administrative receiver and the appointment takes effect upon receipt (provided that the administrative
receiver formally accepts the appointment by the end of the next business day). There is no statutory
moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the appointment of an administrative receiver.

The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the
principal and interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was
appointed (the ‘‘Secured Debt’’). An administrative receiver generally has broad powers to deal with the
company and its assets which derive from both the security document pursuant to which he or she was
appointed and Schedule 1 of the IA86 (except insofar as this is inconsistent with the terms of that security
document). In exercising such powers, an administrative receiver acts as agent of the company, unless and
until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver can only dispose of assets which are
subject to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is satisfied that the disposal
(with or without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation of the
company’s property than would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and
any difference between those and the open market value are used to discharge that security. Further,
unlike an administrator, an administrative receiver’s powers do not extend to bringing actions against the
directors or former directors or (except in very limited circumstances) seeking to set aside certain
transactions.

Assets coming into the hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less
any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (as to the meaning of which see
‘‘Statutory order of priorities’’ below).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court
procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of
challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator
is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges—see ‘‘Administrative receivership’’ above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured
by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited
circumstances) pursuant to statute.

478


-----

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand
made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a
liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge
receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a ‘‘financial collateral
arrangement’’, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which he or she is appointed,
meaning he or she owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an
administrator, who performs his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other
words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising
the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the
circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of
any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a
contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the prescribed part and any
preferential creditors.

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation proceedings may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or
Scotland; (ii) the debtor’s COMI is in the UK, or (iii) the debtor’s COMI is in an EU member state and
there is an establishment in the UK. The English courts can also open compulsory liquidation (see below)
in respect of foreign companies as unregistered companies if such foreign company has a sufficient
connection to England and Wales.

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realized by the
liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see
‘‘Statutory order of priorities’’ below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has
completed this task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into
members’ voluntary liquidation (‘‘MVL’’) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (‘‘CVL’’). Compulsory
liquidation is a court-based procedure initiated by the presentation of a winding-up petition, commonly but
not exclusively on the grounds that the company is unable to pay its debts (see ‘‘The Insolvency Test’’).
Voluntary liquidations are initiated by the company out-of-court. A CVL is initiated by the shareholders
but the process involves some degree of control by the creditors. The company may be solvent or insolvent.
An MVL is a solvent voluntary liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders and, given that it requires
that all creditors are paid in full, no further detail on MVLs is included here.

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its
creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever is necessary for the conduct of the liquidation.
This includes the power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s
property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous
property or contracts in accordance with section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or
former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside certain transactions (see ‘‘Antecedent Transaction Laws’’
below in respect of the latter).

In a compulsory liquidation, under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any
transfer of the company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made
following the ‘commencement of a winding up’ unless the court orders otherwise (this means that the
relevant Issuer loses its ability to service its debt, for example, without the court’s permission). Further,
there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the company or its
property except with the permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose
although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such
automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or
contributory of the company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.

A liquidator may make distributions to unsecured creditors and in doing so they will also follow the
statutory order of priorities (see ‘‘Statutory order of priorities’’ below). The holders of the Notes would
receive payment as unsecured creditors alongside other unsecured creditors and based on a proof of debt

479


-----

the trustee of the Notes would submit on behalf of the holders of the Notes (i.e. the holders of the Notes
would not receive any (further) interest/coupon payments or any payment on maturity set out in the terms
of the Notes themselves).

A liquidation does not in itself terminate financial or commercial contracts, but a liquidator does have the
power to disclaim onerous contracts and he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it
to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an
unsecured debt—see ‘‘Statutory order of priorities’’ below).

Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms in
supplier contracts providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon
the occurrence of an insolvency event (including liquidation) will generally be suspended for the duration
of the relevant insolvency procedure (see ‘‘Supplier contracts’’ below).

**_Restructuring procedures_**

As well as formal insolvency proceedings, there are various restructuring tools under the laws of England
which a Guarantor may be subject to and which may adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce
their rights relating to the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Some of these processes are under the CA 2006
(e.g., a scheme of arrangement and a restructuring plan) and some under the IA86 (e.g., a company
voluntary arrangement). Further details on these processes are set out below.

**_Schemes of arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the
compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors)
where such company is liable to be wound-up under the IA86 (see ‘‘Liquidation/Winding-Up’’ above); and,
in the context of a foreign company, requires a ‘‘sufficient connection’’ to the English jurisdiction. In
practice, the ‘‘sufficient connection’’ test has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the
company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the
company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by
English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous
cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in
the present case.

Recognition of an English scheme (commenced after December 31, 2020) in an EU member state will, in
part, be dependent on that member state’s private internal law rules. Where a contract is English law
governed, Regulation (EC) 593/2008 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations
(Rome I) (‘‘Rome I’’) continues to apply following the UK’s exit from the EU. While not historically solely
relied on, it is considered possible that the amendments to such English law governed contracts effected by
a UK scheme would be recognized in EU member states under Rome I.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise
in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such
creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given
under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75% or more by
value and over 50% in number of those creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) of each
class vote in favor of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, that compromise will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding
on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the
scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances,
a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of
the compromise. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an
order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Pursuant to Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a
compromise or arrangement (a ‘‘Restructuring Plan’’) proposed between a company and its creditors
and/or members (or any class of its creditors and/or members) in circumstances where the company has
encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, its ability to

480


-----

carry on business as a going concern. The purpose of the Restructuring Plan must be to eliminate, reduce
or prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial difficulties. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, the
Restructuring Plan procedure is open to any company liable to be wound up under the IA86 (i.e. a foreign
company may use the procedure provided that certain conditions are met).

For a consensual plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favor) to be capable of being sanctioned by the
court, the Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or members in each class
present in person or by proxy and voting at each meeting convened to consider the Restructuring Plan
(there is no majority by number test as is the case with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also
apply to the court to exclude a class from voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company.
Unlike a scheme, if the Restructuring Plan is not approved by a number representing at least 75% in value
of any class of creditors or members of the company present in person or by proxy and voting at the
relevant plan meeting (the ‘‘Dissenting Class’’), the Dissenting Class may be crammed down provided that:
(i) the court is satisfied that no members of the Dissenting Class would be any worse off under the
Restructuring Plan than they would be in the most likely alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the
Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned (the ‘relevant alternative’); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan is agreed
by 75% by value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) members present in person or by proxy and
voting at the relevant plan meeting who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in
the company in the event of the relevant alternative. Even if the voting threshold is met, the court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan and will refuse to sanction if it is not ‘just and
equitable’ to do so. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it will be binding on all affected parties,
including those who did not participate in the vote on the Restructuring Plan and those who voted against
the Restructuring Plan.

**_Restructuring moratorium_**

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, a free-standing moratorium is available
to protect certain companies, both UK and overseas if there is a sufficient connection with England, from
creditor action for a specified period, granting a ‘payment holiday’ for ‘pre-moratorium debts’.
Pre-moratorium debts are debts due prior to the moratorium coming into force or debts which become due
during the moratorium if they relate to obligations incurred before the moratorium comes into force. The
moratorium is similar in scope to that which applies in administration, preventing security enforcement
and legal proceedings amongst other things. Like the moratorium which applies in administration, this
moratorium does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral
arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations. Unlike the moratorium which
applies in administration, this moratorium prevents the crystallization of a floating charge. In order to be
eligible for the moratorium a company must be or be likely to be unable to pay its debts and the
moratorium must be likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. However, there are
broad exclusions including for companies which are party to a capital markets arrangement, which will
apply in this case once the Notes have been issued.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the IA86, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable)
may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails
a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors. Provided that the proposal is
approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured
creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal (notwithstanding the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents). A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a
secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

A company is eligible to propose a company voluntary arrangement proposal if it is: (a) a company
registered under the CA 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland; (b) a company incorporated in an EEA
State, or (c) a company not incorporated in an EEA State but having its COMI in a member state other
than Denmark.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least
75 per cent (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, a majority (by
value) of the company’s members and no more than 50 per cent (by value) of unconnected creditors may
vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured

481


-----

creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company
voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Supplier contracts_**

One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is
that it can trigger termination or other consequences under supplier contracts. This makes the company
vulnerable to ransom creditors. New provisions have been introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and
Governance Act 2020 in order to supplement the existing essential supplier regime (see below) to help the
continuation of supply of goods and services to companies in an insolvency process.

_Essential suppliers_

The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the IA86 (i) prevents the suppliers from,
where a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including administration,
liquidation and company voluntary arrangements (‘‘CVA’’)) and a request is made by or with the
concurrence of the insolvency officer holder for the giving, after the date that insolvency procedure
commenced or the CVA took effect (as applicable), of any essential supplies, making it a condition of the
giving of the supply, or doing anything which has the effect of making it a condition of the giving of the
supply, that any outstanding charges in respect of a supply given to the company before the effective date
are paid; and (ii) where a company enters administration or a CVA takes effect, subject to certain
exceptions, compels continued supply by restricting the effect of existing insolvency-related terms in
contracts for the supply of essential goods or services.

Essential goods and services include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi
and chip-and-pin devices.

_Other suppliers_

Section 233B of the IA86 says that (subject to certain exceptions), if a company is subject to a qualifying
form of insolvency procedure (including the new moratorium, CVA, administration and liquidation or
where a court order is made summoning a meeting relating to a Restructuring Plan), (i) any provision of a
supply contract which provides that the contract or supply would terminate, or any other thing would take
place, or that the supplier would be entitled to terminate the contract or the supply or do any other thing
(for example, change payment or supply terms) because the company becomes subject to the relevant
insolvency procedure, will cease to have effect; (ii) suppliers will be unable to exercise any entitlement
arising before the start of the insolvency period to terminate the contract or the supply because of an event
occurring before the start of the insolvency period, for the duration of the insolvency period (which in
some cases could be measured in years) and (iii) suppliers will be unable to impose ransoms by demanding
payment of outstanding amounts in respect of pre-commencement supply as a condition of continuing
supply.

The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts. Certain contracts involving financial
services are excluded from the regime, including a capital market arrangement. In addition, certain types
of entities (such as banks or insurance companies), whether such entities are the customer or the supplier,
are excluded from this regime. Additionally, the regime does not apply to insolvency-related terms of a
contract for the supply of essential goods or services which cease to have effect under section 233A of the
IA86 (as described above).

Suppliers may still terminate contracts if: (i) they receive consent from the company or insolvency
officeholder (where in office); or (ii) the court is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause
the supplier hardship and grants permission for the termination of the contract. Supplier rights relating to
events arising after the insolvency process begins are not affected.

**_Statutory order of priorities_**

A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with a set statutory order of priority when he or she
distributes the proceeds of realized assets to a company’s creditors and, with the exception of the
prescribed part (as described below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the

482


-----

claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. This statutory order of priority is
broadly summarized as follows:

(a) proceeds of realizations from assets subject to a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less
any costs of realization);

(b) any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver and moratorium debts and certain ‘‘priority
pre-moratorium debts’’ in circumstances where a company has entered into a restructuring
moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation within 12 weeks beginning
with the day after the end of the moratorium;

(c) expenses of the liquidation or the administration, which includes monies arising under a contract
entered into by the administrator or liquidator, or any necessary disbursements made in the ordinary
insolvency process;

(d) ordinary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), which include (but are not limited
to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to contributions to occupational and state pension
schemes, wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person, holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme (‘‘FSCS’’) up to the statutory limit;

(e) secondary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), including bank and building
society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the
statutory limit, deposits made through a non-UK branch of a credit institution that would otherwise
have been eligible for FSCS compensation and claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including
VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and
Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI
contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers;

(f) subject to certain exceptions, the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money that the
administrator or liquidator must set aside from realizations from floating charge assets to distribute to
unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating
charge realizations, and unless the cost of making the prescribed part available to unsecured creditors
would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors)—calculated as 50% of the first £10,000
of net realizations and 20% of the net realizations thereafter, up to a maximum of £800,000 (except
where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating
charge created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000);

(g) proceeds of floating charge asset realizations (less any costs of realization, the preferential debts and
the prescribed part), according to the priority of the security;

(h) provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank equally among themselves unless there are
subordination agreements in place between any of them) and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date
of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings (to pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the prescribed part unless the prescribed part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors);

(i) statutory interest that arises on debts after the commencement of liquidation or after the
commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration at
the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the
Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum); and

(j) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which
are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

Any surplus following the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full will be paid to the shareholders in
accordance with the company’s articles of association. There are no equitable subordination provisions
under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a provable debt alongside other
unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

483


-----

Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis,
that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual set-off arrangements exercised after a company enters liquidation or after the administration
insolvency set-off rules apply are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of ‘‘mutual
dealing’’ as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of
what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net
balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts
remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain
due to the company).

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

In administration or liquidation, any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling must be
converted into pounds sterling at a single rate for each currency as determined by the administrator or
liquidator by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the date that the company went into
administration or liquidation. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. Accordingly, in
the event that the relevant Issuer or a Guarantor goes into a UK liquidation or administration, holders of
the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the relevant Issuer or such
Guarantor went into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such
holders of the Notes may become entitled (by way of a distribution in the liquidation or administration).

**_Post-petition interest_**

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes or any Note Guarantee to which
an English company is a party (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in
respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be
recoverable from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the English company’s
insolvency proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the commencement of those
proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be
discharged out of such security recoveries.

**_Trust Assets_**

Assets held on trust by the company for a third party generally fall outside the insolvent estate that is
available for distribution.

**_Antecedent Transaction Laws_**

There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s
insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238);
(ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions
defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the
exception of section 423 which applies regardless of whether the company is in insolvency proceedings. The
granting of security or guarantees by a company could be subject to challenge under these provisions. The
Issuers cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described
below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest by a UK Guarantor and/or
any UK Guarantor’s guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would
uphold the transaction as valid.

_Transactions at an undervalue_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue,
the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that
section 118 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the ‘‘SBEEA’’) introduced
section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may
assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any transaction
under section 238 of the IA86. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the
Model Law Regulations, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction at an undervalue.

484


-----

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift
or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a
consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money
or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the
relevant time (2 years before the onset of insolvency, being broadly the commencement of its liquidation or
administration); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the
transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86 (although there is a
rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the
transaction is made to a person connected to the company such as a shareholder or a director (a
‘‘connected person’’)).

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the
company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its
business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would
benefit the company.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such
order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been
entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company
was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the IA86, as
amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate
the solvency of the company in such proceedings.

_Preferences_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the
application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the
SBEEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of
any preference claim under section 239 of the IA86. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted
recognition under the Model Law Regulations he or she also has standing to bring a preference claim.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has
suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a
position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the
position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced
in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than that person would
have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in
the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (6 months before the
onset of the insolvency or 2 years before the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a connected
person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction,
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86.

If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers
for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given. However, for
the court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the company was influenced by
a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to
demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a
desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person,
in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such
influence.

The desire to prefer requires a ‘‘positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the
company’s insolvent liquidation’’ (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a
creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by
‘‘proper commercial considerations’’ there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference
(Re MC Bacon [1990] BCLC 324).

485


-----

_Voidable floating charges_

A floating charge created by a company over its property may be invalid if it was created in the relevant
time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of 2 years before the
onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset on
insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction,
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86. However, if the floating charge
qualifies as a ‘‘security financial collateral agreement’’ under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the
floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically
invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of
the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon)
supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. This means that a floating
charge can be partly invalid to the extent that it is provided for past consideration. No court action is
required save for where there is a foreign officeholder recognised under the Model Law Regulations who
wishes to challenge the floating charge under article 23 of the Model Law Regulations.

In practical terms, a floating charge will therefore only be invalid to the extent that it is given in exchange
for prior consideration (eg to secure loans previously made) and any floating charge provided to, amongst
other matters, secure new debt provided at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, will not
be invalid under section 245 of the IA86.

The requirement for the company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating
charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is
granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to
above, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of the money
paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of
such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in reduction/discharge in debt), the
relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant
company is solvent or insolvent.

_Transactions defrauding creditors_

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside by the court if: (i) the transaction is at an
undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a
person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing that person’s
interests in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an
undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder and can be made by, subject to
certain conditions, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK
Pensions Regulator. The victim of the transaction can apply to court himself or herself to set aside a
transaction. A foreign officeholder recognized under the Model Law Regulations also has standing to
apply to court. The IA86 also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action (subject to
the normal statutory limitation periods). The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest
motive is no defense to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the
assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was
the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make
such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been
entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may
affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom
the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which
was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the
relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good
faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a
party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit
transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder or a foreign officeholder
recognized under the Model Law Regulations, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the
SBEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of
any extortionate credit transaction claim under section 244 of the IA86.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit,
either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary
principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up
to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation
(which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an
undervalue and preferences).

**_Orders_**

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court
has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which
existed before the transaction was entered into.

**_Fixed and floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the
floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the
time the fixed charge was granted); (b) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or
administrator’s remuneration and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company
while in administration) properly incurred in a winding up or administration are payable out of the
charging company’s assets (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge)
and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash
and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to floating charge claims; (c) an
administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the
prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in
respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) until the floating
charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to
give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security;
(e) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to certain additional
challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise
arising under a ‘‘financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments
such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial
Collateral Regulations, floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors
(such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing of
the ‘‘prescribed part’’ for unsecured creditors. This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of
consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests.

Please note, however, that with prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property
subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the
administration and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in
question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there
is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created by a
security document governed by English law as floating charges; the description given to security interests
by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed
security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the
chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant
assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice.

487


-----

Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the course of its business
without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallisation, the court is likely to hold that the security
interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge
in the security documents.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be
required to ring-fence the ‘prescribed part’ (see ‘‘Statutory Order of Priority’’ above).

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail above) following the
granting of the guarantee or security.

**_Secondary Legislation_**

UK secondary legislation may be invalid and ineffective if, among other things, it is not enacted within the
scope of the relevant primary statute or within the powers of the relevant rule-making authorities.

**_Filings_**

The prescribed particulars in respect of a security document under which an English company purports to
create security, together with a certified copy of the security document, should be delivered to the
Registrar of Companies within 21 days after the date of the security document in accordance with Chapter
A1 of Part 25 of the CA 2006 (‘‘Chapter A1’’). Failing this, the security created by the security document
will be void against a liquidator or administrator and any creditor of the charging company. The
application of Chapter A1 to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral
Regulations. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under Chapter A1 (as set
out in section 859A(6) of the CA 2006): (i) a charge in favour of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a
security in connection with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the
meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at
Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of the CA 2006 by or under any
other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking Act 2009). Registration
may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of a
pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities. In some cases, such as the registration regime
under the CA 2006, the priority of security interests which are registrable and have been duly registered
follows chronological order of creation (subject to certain exceptions—see, for example, and without
limitation, the exceptions under ‘‘Assignments’’ below). In other cases, priority in respect of security
interests over certain types of asset depends on the time at which those security interests are registered in a
particular asset register. Thus, for instance, the priority of security interests over ships and aircraft are
governed by their respective dates of registration in the appropriate register, whether or not the relevant
secured party had notice of an earlier unregistered security interest over the relevant asset. Similar rules
apply in relation to security interests over registered land and certain intellectual property rights, such as
patents.

**_Corporate authorizations and maintenance of capital_**

The legality, validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Notes, the Note Guarantees and the security interest in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (as
applicable) are subject to matters affecting companies generally, including that: (i) its entry into and
performance of such obligations: (A) are not prohibited by its constitutional documents (or contracts to
which it is party); and (B) have been duly authorized and do not breach or result in inconsistency with
applicable laws or regulations; and (ii) the documents evidencing such obligations have been duly executed
and delivered in accordance with all applicable procedures and laws. In addition, the granting of
guarantees and security by an English company could be subject to challenge if it results in a reduction in
that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent that it does, the company does
not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

**_Enforcement_**

Enforcement of guarantees and security may be affected by general legal and equitable principles
regarding the legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and
liabilities (including guarantees and security).

488


-----

**_Assignments_**

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a
legal assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that
provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not
purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying
obligor. If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable
assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations,
including, without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent
legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest;
and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of
such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The
first person to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the
prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest.

**_Share mortgages_**

A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if the relevant transfers of shares are
registered, although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest.

**_Turnover trust_**

A turnover trust may be construed as creating a registrable charge under section 859A of the CA06, in
which case it will be void in the circumstances set out in section 859H of the CA06, unless the prescribed
statement of particulars, together with a certified copy of the agreement or instrument under which the
turnover trust arises, are delivered to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with section 859A of the
CA06 within 21 days after the date of creation of that charge (unless an order allowing an extended period
is made under section 859F of the CA06).

**_Ranking_**

The description given by the parties to the ranking of security interests is not determinative of the ranking
of those security interests.

**_Foreign laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt
or other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject
to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English
law, the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third party rights_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance
policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

**_Amendments_**

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a
guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or
suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

**_Fetters on exercise of powers_**

A provision under which a company or other legal person agrees, or purports to agree, to fetter the
exercise of its powers under its constitutional documents or any applicable law (or regulation) may not be
enforceable against the company or other legal person.

**_Account Bank’s right to set off_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by a UK Guarantor,
the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ‘‘Account Bank’’) may have reserved their
right at any time to exercise the rights of set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other

489


-----

arrangements with that UK Guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is
merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be
subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged
under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed
charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the
relevant UK Guarantor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will
no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s set-off rights that accrue after the date of such notice
to the Account Bank unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.

**Switzerland**

**_Certain Choice of Law Considerations_**

The Note Guarantees given by a Guarantor or security provider (as applicable) organized under the laws
of Switzerland (each a ‘‘Swiss Guarantor’’)and the share pledge agreement in respect of all the shares in
US Holdco by Swiss Midco are, based on a choice of law, subject to the laws of New York. In addition,
certain other SSN Collateral granted by the Guarantors is governed by Swiss law and certain other SSN
Collateral granted by the Swiss Guarantors is governed by non-Swiss laws, including English law or the
laws of Luxembourg. Should a Swiss court accept jurisdiction in proceedings on the merits, a Swiss court
will generally recognize the choice of law as being applicable to the parties thereto. However, such choice
of law in the security agreements governing such SSN Collateral may not be asserted against third parties
(which term includes other creditors of the relevant security provider), who may, as a rule, alternatively
rely, in the case of pledges, on the law at the usual residence of the pledgee or, in case of a security
assignment, the governing law of the assigned rights and claims. The scope of a choice of law with respect
to the Note Guarantees and SSN Collateral is, usually, limited to the rules of the substantive law chosen by
the parties; as to procedural matters, a Swiss court will apply Swiss procedural law. Due to the different
nature of Swiss procedural law and the procedural law in common law jurisdictions (such as the United
States and the United Kingdom) classification and delimitation issues between substantive and procedural
law could occur. To establish the non-Swiss substantive law applicable to the merits, a Swiss court may, in
pecuniary matters, request that the parties establish the non-Swiss substantive law; Swiss law will be
applied, if the content of the foreign substantive law cannot be established. While a Swiss court will
generally accept a choice of law, restrictively applied exceptions exist: Swiss courts may diverge from the
chosen substantive law if such chosen law would lead to a result contrary to Swiss public policy, if the
purpose of mandatory rules of Swiss law require, by their special aim, immediate application, or if the
purpose of mandatory rules of another law, to which the dispute is closely connected, are considered
legitimate under Swiss legal concepts and, upon weighing the interests of the parties involved, the clearly
predominant interest(s) of one party so require.

**_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations_**

In the event of a Swiss Guarantor’s insolvency, the respective insolvency proceedings would likely be
governed by Swiss law as a result of the respective Swiss Guarantor’s offices being registered in the
competent commercial register in Switzerland. In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws
may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests granted over assets located in
Switzerland. The insolvency laws of Switzerland in general and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss
Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (Bundesgesetz ¨uber Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs,
‘‘DEBA’’) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions,
including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of
the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the
Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief
description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force. However, with regard
to assets located outside of Switzerland, a Swiss bankruptcy decree may only be enforceable if it is
recognized at the place where such assets are located.

Under Swiss insolvency laws, there is no group insolvency concept (with the exception of limited
coordination of related proceedings occurring in Switzerland by the involved authorities), which means
there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In
case of a group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency laws point of view, to be dealt with
separately, although proceedings of group companies occurring simultaneously in Switzerland are
coordinated where possible. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and against each entity have to be dealt with separately.

490


-----

Under Swiss law, insolvency proceedings may be opened against an entity having its registered office or
assets in Switzerland.

In the event of insolvency of a Swiss Guarantor, guarantees and any security interests provided by such
Swiss Guarantor would likely be subject to Swiss insolvency law.

As long as the debtor has not been declared bankrupt, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special
enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless
the parties have validly agreed on a private enforcement. If bankruptcy proceedings are being opened
while such special enforcement proceeding is pending, such special enforcement proceeding ceases and the
creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and private enforcement would
no longer be permitted as a rule.

Swiss insolvency law provides for two primary insolvency regimes, namely: (i) the composition procedure
(Nachlassverfahren) and (ii) the bankruptcy procedure (Konkurs). The composition procedure is in general
intended to restructure a debtor’s critical financial situation and enable the debtor to continue its business
on a reorganized financial basis. It can also be used to liquidate the debtor or the debtor’s assets.
Bankruptcy procedure is merely designed to liquidate the debtor’s assets and to distribute the proceeds of
the liquidation to the debtor’s creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the DEBA.

The composition procedure will result in a settlement with all creditors called the composition agreement.
It may take the form of: (i) a percentage agreement, where the debtor promises the creditors to pay only
part of its debts and the creditors waive any excess claims; such percentage agreement can also be limited
to a grant of a respite, where the debtor and the creditors agree on a payment plan according to which the
debtor will pay its debts in full, but over time; or (ii) an assignment of assets (also called a liquidation
agreement), where the debtor assigns its assets (or parts of its assets) to the creditors and the creditors will
be satisfied out of the proceeds of the liquidation of these assets. Claims beyond such amounts will be
deemed waived.

To initiate a composition procedure, an application for a moratorium of payments (Nachlassstundung) will
be made by the debtor itself. In certain circumstances, this can also be done by creditors. For a percentage
agreement, the debtor has to show that such an agreement is in the best interest of the creditors, whereas
for a liquidation agreement it is required that creditors receive a higher dividend than in a bankruptcy.
Upon application to the competent court, the court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium
provisionally (provisorische Stundung) for a maximum period of four month or not. With its decision the
court usually appoints a commissioner provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). The court may decide to
not make public the grant of the provisional moratorium if certain requirements are met. In case during
the period of the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a composition agreement
(Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court
approves the moratorium definitely and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where
deemed necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gl¨aubigerausschuss) for the purpose of supervising
the commissioner. The commissioner organizes a meeting of creditors (Gl¨aubigerversammlung) which has
to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific majority rules. The composition
agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the composition court.

Official debt enforcement proceedings (Betreibungen) cannot be initiated or continued as long as the
moratorium is in effect, except for claims secured by a mortgage on real estate, but such mortgaged real
estate may not be realized during the moratorium. An assignment or pledge with respect to claims which
arise after the granting of a moratorium would no longer be effective. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to
dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party may not be
entitled to proceed with a private enforcement during the moratorium until the confirmation of the
settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the settlement only for the amount of
its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts
(contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). The
moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts
become immediately due upon adjudication) unless a liquidation agreement is approved by the necessary
majority of creditors and the competent court. However, upon the grant of a moratorium, the debtor may,
with the consent of the commissionar, terminate long term contracts (Dauerschuldverh¨altnisse) at any time
and with effect as per a date to be chosen by the debtor if adherence to the long term contract would
jeopardize the restructuring of the insolvent debtor. The moratorium aims at facilitating the conclusion of
one of the above composition agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the
creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition

491


-----

agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition
agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims.

The moratorium affects the rights of unsecured creditors. In particular, the debtor is protected against
involuntary bankruptcy, and the enforcement of final and enforceable judgments is stayed. Unless the
composition agreement otherwise stipulates, claims of unsecured creditors no longer bear interest.

Under Swiss insolvency law, as a rule, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings it has to file an application for
commencement of enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection
office (Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located
where the debtor is registered or resident. The collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of
payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is virtually no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor
may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag)
to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No reasons need to be given
for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor of the objection.

For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can without any further delay file an application
to lift this stay with the court (Rechts¨offnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an enforceable judgment,
but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be
applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechts¨offnung). In the event the objection is set aside in
these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court proceedings
for negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage).

The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to continue the enforcement proceedings
(Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent
debt collection office then notifies the debtor without delay that bankruptcy proceedings will be opened
unless payment of the debt is forthcoming (Konkursandrohung). The insolvency court may take preliminary
measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the
creditor’s rights. After 20 days from receipt of the notice that bankruptcy proceedings will be opened
(Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition the opening of bankruptcy proceedings. The competent
bankruptcy court decides upon the bankruptcy without any delay, provided that there are no reasons which
would lead to a suspension of the bankruptcy court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a
request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the bankruptcy
court.

However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt without such prior proceedings if the
following requirements are met: (i) at the request of the debtor, if the debtor’s board of directors or, in
case of failure of the board of directors, the auditors of the company declare that the debtor is
over-indebted within the meaning of art. 725 (2) of the Swiss Code of Obligations (Bundesgesetz vom
_30. M¨arz 1911 betreffend die Erg¨anzung des Schweizerischen Zivilgesetzbuches: Obligationenrecht, ‘‘CO’’) or if_
it declares to be insolvent according to the DEBA, and (ii) at the request of a creditor, if the debtor
fraudulently commits certain acts to the detriment of its creditors or ceases to make payments according to
the DEBA or if certain events happen during composition proceedings. Generally, pursuant to Swiss
corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be
assessed pursuant to the accounting standards of the CO and on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn
up (i) on the basis of the going concern value of the debtor’s assets and (ii)—to the extent there is no more
a going concern scenario—based upon the liquidation value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the
creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at going concern values nor at liquidation values, the
debtor’s board of directors has to notify the insolvency court, provided that creditors of the debtor do not
agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the over-indebtedness (art. 725 CO).
However, as soon as the debtor loses the going concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern
values become irrelevant and over-indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the
criterion of over-indebtedness is based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important
to note that a debtor’s inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the
going concern assumption for accounting purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation
values. This, in turn, will typically result in over-indebtedness. The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to
file for insolvency without delay and non-compliance with this obligation exposes board of directors to
both damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need not file
for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s

492


-----

over-indebtedness subordinate their claims against the claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a
substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e. out-of-court) workout within a relatively short period of time.
Finally, the debtor’s auditors have the obligation to notify the competent court if the debtor’s board of
directors has failed to file for insolvency despite the debtor being obviously over-indebted.

The insolvency court orders the continuation of bankruptcy proceedings if certain requirements are met, in
particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets
of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the bankruptcy court will only order to continue bankruptcy
proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings
themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the bankruptcy proceedings will be closed for
insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the bankruptcy
office may request the bankruptcy court to resolve upon summary bankruptcy proceedings (summarisches
_Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency proceedings or_
the actual facts of the case are simple. Also, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary
bankruptcy proceedings if they provide adequate security for the anticipated uncovered costs caused by an
ordinary bankruptcy proceeding.

Upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung), the right to administer and
dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the bankruptcy office. The bankruptcy
office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate, provided that certain acts
require the approval of the bankruptcy court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency
administration and, in addition, a creditors’ committee. In such case, the private bankruptcy administration
will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate. The creditors’ committee has additional
competences. The designated bankruptcy administrator will draw up an inventory of the assets and, further
to a creditors’ call for the filing of claims, establish a schedule of claims (Kollokationsplan). Any creditor
wishing to contest the schedule of claims because his claim has been entirely or partially rejected by the
administrator or not allocated in the rank requested must bring an action against the estate before the
competent court. If any creditor wishes to contest the admission of another creditor to the schedule of
claims or the allocated rank, he must bring an action against such creditor. Such court proceedings could
cause holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could
recover in a U.S. liquidation. Such proceedings could also cause payment to the holders of the Notes to be
delayed, as compared with holders of undisputed claims.

Bankruptcy results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for
those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real estate, and the relevant claims become due upon
bankruptcy. As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount
of the debt (discounted at 5% for claims that are not due at the time of opening of bankruptcy and not
interest bearing for a period up to maturity of such claims), interest accrued thereon until the date of
bankruptcy, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon bankruptcy, interest ceases to accrue. Only secured
claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is
realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such
interests.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right), wishing to assert claims
against the debtor need to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings. Swiss bankruptcy proceedings are
collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but
can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws.

All assets at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received subsequently
form the bankrupt estate, which after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, are used to satisfy the
creditors. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public
auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover
(i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to
satisfy unsecured creditors.

Assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s
estate and will be realized by the bankruptcy administration. As a consequence, the private enforcement of
pledged assets is not permitted and the enforcement mandatorily occurs according to the rules of the
DEBA. The secured creditor is under an obligation to remit the pledged assets to the bankrupt estate. The
assets are liquidated by the receiver in bankruptcy in the same manner as the other assets of the bankrupt
estate, but secured creditors retain their rights to be satisfied from the proceeds of the liquidation of the
assets pledged to it with priority over the unsecured creditors. If the proceeds from the sale of the pledged

493


-----

assets exceed the secured claims, the surplus is available for distribution to the unsecured creditors. If the
enforcement proceeds are not sufficient to fully satisfy the secured claims, the remainder of the claims
have equal rank as unsecured claims with all other unsecured and (provided it is not a privileged claim)
non-prioritized claims.

Claims assigned for security purposes, such is, for example, the case under the terms of the share pledge
agreement in respect of all the shares in US Holdco by Swiss Midco, by a Swiss Guarantor that come into
existence prior to the opening of bankruptcy can be enforced by the secured creditor outside Swiss
bankruptcy proceedings subject to potential avoidance actions. According to the current jurisprudence of
the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, assigned claims that come into existence after the opening of bankruptcy
over a Swiss entity or similar insolvency proceedings that lead to the loss of the capacity of the relevant
assignor to dispose of such rights or claims may generally not be enforceable by the secured creditor and,
hence, may fall within the bankruptcy estate and the secured creditor may not be entitled to such claims
and the proceeds from an enforcement of such claims. With regard to assigned claims that come into
existence prior to bankruptcy, enforcement in a strict sense is not necessary as the ownership has already
been transferred to the secured party. Enforcement in this context essentially means that the obligation to
return the transferred assets under the security agreement expires. However, this must follow similar rules
as for the private enforcement of a pledge and must generally be made in accordance with the principle of
good faith, adequately taking into account the security provider’s interests, in particular the security
interests are to be valued fairly, the valuation must be properly documented, the secured obligations must
be repaid by set-off out of the proceeds of the realization and any surplus after satisfaction of the secured
obligations must be accounted for and repaid to the party having granted security.

Final distribution of non-secured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in three classes. The first and the
second class, which are privileged, comprise claims under employment contracts, accident insurance,
pension plans and family law. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the government and its subdivisions
based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors are treated equally in the third class. A
secured party participates in the third class to the extent its claim is not covered by its collateral.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration may, under certain conditions, avoid
transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of or the payment under any guarantee or security or, if a
payment has already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipients return
the amount received to the debtor’s estate. In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of
a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors
may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to
the creditors, which according to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court is generally assumed
and can only be negated in a limited number of cases:

- The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any
consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the seizure
of assets (Pf¨andung) or the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung) or the
confirmation of a liquidation agreement in connection with a composition proceeding relating to it.
Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was
disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant
transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the
burden of proof is shifted: the beneficiary must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s
length.

- Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the seizure of assets
(Pf¨andung) or the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung) or the confirmation
of a liquidation agreement in connection with a composition proceeding relating to it provided that
the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for existing claims, provided
that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary
obligation in any other way than by payment in cash or other customary means of payment, and
(iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is dismissed if the beneficiary
of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being
diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time.

- Furthermore, any acts performed by the debtor within the last five years prior to the seizure of assets
(Pf¨andung) or the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung) or the confirmation

494


-----

of a liquidation agreement in connection with a composition proceeding relating to it with the
intention of the debtor to disadvantage some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to
others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence, must have been
known to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor
is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted: the
beneficiary must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable.

The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by the relevant Swiss
Guarantor’s guarantee or security as well as any security granted by non-Swiss Guarantors that are located
in Switzerland. If any guarantee or security is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any
other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee or security and would
have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining guarantees or security, if any. Any amounts
obtained from transactions that have been avoided would have to be repaid.

**_Certain Guarantee and Security Limitations_**

The validity and the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest provided by a Swiss Guarantor may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, re-organization, corporate, tax, contract or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting creditors and secured parties (including provisions relating to fraudulent
transfer, voidable preference, corporate purpose, financial assistance, capital maintenance and solvency),
international private laws (including ordre public) or laws or principles of general application (including
but not limited to the abuse of rights (Rechtsmissbrauch), the principle of good faith (Grundsatz von Treu
_und Glauben) and public policy)._

The incurrence by any Swiss Guarantor of any liabilities in respect of obligations of its direct or indirect
shareholder(s) (‘‘up-stream’’) or of related persons or entities of its shareholder(s) (‘‘cross-stream’’) other
than any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries is subject to certain Swiss corporate law rules that
may significantly impact the value of the guarantee or the security interest granted by any Swiss Guarantor.
In particular, up-stream and cross-stream guarantees and security interest must be within the corporate
purpose and scope, as set forth in the articles of association of the relevant Swiss Guarantor. In addition,
the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest provided by a Swiss Guarantor may be treated as a
deemed dividend distribution to shareholders.

The liabilities of any Swiss Guarantor under any up-stream or cross-stream guarantee and security interest
are at any time (to the extent that such is a requirement of applicable Swiss law in force at the relevant
time) limited to a sum equal to the maximum amount of the respective Swiss Guarantor’s freely disposable
equity capital at the relevant time, provided that such limitations shall not free the respective Swiss
Guarantor from payment obligations in excess of its freely disposable equity, but merely postpone the
payment date of those obligations until such time as payment is permitted notwithstanding such
limitations. Such freely disposable equity capital will be determined on the basis of a stand-alone audited
balance sheet of such Swiss Guarantor in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss accounting principles. The
freely disposable equity capital of such Swiss Guarantor may be reduced by (1) the aggregate amount of
the intercompany loans, if any, granted by such Swiss Guarantor to any affiliates or related parties (other
than its direct or indirect subsidiaries), and (2) other adjustments. The payment under the respective Swiss
Guarantor’s guarantee and the application of enforcement proceeds derived from security granted by a
Swiss Guarantor against the secured obligations may require certain prior corporate formalities to be
completed including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board
resolutions. There can be no assurance that the relevant Swiss Guarantor will have any or sufficient freely
disposable equity capital available at the relevant time to satisfy the obligations under the Note Guarantee
or other obligations (if any) assumed towards the Noteholders or to use the enforcement proceeds of the
security granted by the respective Swiss Guarantor.

Payments under the Note Guarantees and/or enforcement of security interests provided by a Swiss
Guarantor may be subject to Swiss withholding tax (of up to 35% at current rates, subject to the applicable
double-taxation treaties and/or the discharging of the liability to such tax by notification rather than
payment of the tax) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of security interest falls to be regarded
as a deemed dividend distribution by the respective Swiss Guarantor to the Issuer or any other related
party.

For the above reasons, it is market practice for, inter alia, indentures, guarantees and security agreements
to contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to the respective Swiss Guarantor. Pursuant to such
limitation language, the enforcement of the Note Guarantee and security interests granted by a Swiss

495


-----

Guarantor will be limited, reflecting the requirement that payments under the Note Guarantee or, as the
case may be, the use of proceeds from the enforcement of security interests may not cause the Swiss
Guarantor to incur a liability which would exceed its freely disposable equity capital at the time of the
enforcement of the guarantee or, as the case may be, any security interest. These limitations apply in
relation to any Note Guarantee and security interests securing the performance of any obligations of any
(direct or indirect) shareholder and/or any sister company of the Swiss Guarantor granting such Note
Guarantee and/or security.

Financial assistance rules are unsettled under Swiss law. We can provide no assurances that future court
rulings will not further restrict the enforceability, or deny the validity, of guarantees and security interests.
Such rulings would negatively affect the ability to enforce the Note Guarantees and security interests
granted by the Swiss Guarantor or a Swiss security provider.

**_Pledges_**

Because Swiss law governed pledges are subject to the doctrine of accessory (Akzessoriet¨atsprinzip), the
party secured by the pledge must be identical to the creditor of the secured claim. A pledge cannot be
vested in a third party acting as security holder in its own name and right; rather, the pledge must be
granted to the creditor or, in case of notes issues, to all of the note holders as a group.

If and to the extent the beneficial holders of the Senior Secured Notes from time to time will not be party
to such Swiss law governed ‘‘accessory’’ security agreements, there may be a risk regarding the validity and/
or enforceability of such security interest granted in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In
order to mitigate such risk, a parallel debt and joint and several creditorship structure will be used
pursuant to which security interests granted as pledges also are created in favor of the relevant security
agent who will hold a claim equal to each amount payable by the relevant Issuer under the relevant Notes.
Accordingly, the rights of the noteholders may not be directly secured by the pledges provided by Swiss law
governed pledge agreements. Such parallel debt and joint and several creditorship structure has not been
tested under Swiss law and there is no assurance that such a structures will be effective before a Swiss court
because there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy and, therefore, there is no certainty that
such structure will eliminate or mitigate the risk of the pledge in favor of the relevant noteholders being
invalid or unenforceable (see also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risk relating to each Series of Notes—The Collateral will be
_granted to the Security Agent, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Trustee or the_
_Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’). Moreover, the_
instruction and appointment of an agent and any power of attorney may be revoked at any time under
Swiss law notwithstanding the appointment, instruction or power of attorney being said to be irrevocable
and any mandate may, as a matter of statutory law, be terminated at any time by each party to the
mandate. In addition, the noteholders will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the relevant security agent.

Bank accounts are typically subject to a pledge granted to the relevant account banks under the general
terms and conditions of such account banks or separate standard banking documentation. Pursuant to
article 903 of the Swiss Civil Code, a pledge over Swiss bank accounts granted by Swiss Holdco under the
respective Swiss law governed bank account pledge agreement is only valid and perfected if the relevant
Swiss account bank is notified in writing of the pledge to be created under the relevant security agreement
and such pledge ranks junior to any pledges and similar rights (e.g. right of set-off) granted to the relevant
Swiss account bank.

**Luxembourg**

Luxembourg insolvency laws may not be as favorable as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions.

The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to holders of Notes and/or the Notes
guarantors as insolvency laws of other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The following is a
brief description of the key features of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings and certain aspects of
insolvency laws in Luxembourg.

Herens Midco S.`a r.l., Herens Luxco 3 S.`a r.l., and Herens Holdco S.`a r.l. are organized under the laws of
Luxembourg and have their registered office in Luxembourg (together with any future entity which
provides a security and/or a guarantee with respect to the Notes, the ‘‘Luxembourg Obligors’’).

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be
opened against an entity having its registered office and central administration (administration centrale),

496


-----

and, for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation, its center of main interests (centre des int´erˆets
_principaux) in Luxembourg:_

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Luxembourg Obligors
or by any of their creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open
bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg Obligor (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation
_des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (´ebranlement de cr´edit). If a court finds_
that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings ex officio, _i.e., absent a_
request made by the Luxembourg Obligors or a creditor. The main effect of such proceedings is the
suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Luxembourg Obligors, except, subject to
certain limited exceptions, only for secured creditors and the payment of the creditors in accordance
with their rank upon realization of the assets;

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only be requested
by the Luxembourg Obligors and not by their creditors; or

- composition proceedings (concordat pr´eventif de la faillite), which may be requested only by the
Luxembourg Obligors and not by their creditors. The court’s decision to admit a company to the
composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition to these proceedings, the right to receive payment under the Notes and/or the Notes
Guarantee may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiements)
or to put the Luxembourg Obligors into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation
proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity
violating criminal laws or that are in violation of the commercial code or of the laws governing commercial
companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy
proceedings.

The Luxembourg Obligors’ liabilities in respect of the Notes and/or the Notes Guarantee will, in the event
of a liquidation of a Luxembourg Obligor following, in particular, bankruptcy or judicial liquidation
proceedings, rank after the costs of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and those of the Luxembourg Obligors’ debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg
law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include:

- money owed to the Luxembourg revenue in respect of, for example, income tax deducted at source;

- value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

- social security contributions; and

- remuneration owed to employees.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The
ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event
of controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen
until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management and may be
affected thereafter by any reorganization order given by the court. The aforementioned freeze on the
rights of secured creditors does not apply in relation to financial collateral arrangements governed by the
Collateral Act 2005 (as defined below).

Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the
occurrence of an event of default) will not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings,
except where this enforcement of such acceleration involves netting, set-off or the realization of financial
collateral arrangements, all of which are protected against the effects of insolvency proceedings pursuant
to the Collateral Act 2005.

Luxembourg insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Luxembourg
Obligors during the so-called suspect period (p´eriode suspecte) (which is a maximum of six months
preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations, the court may set
the start of the suspect period at an earlier date). In particular:

- pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), specific
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for existing debts, the payment of

497


-----

debts which have not fallen due (whether the payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale,
set-off or by any other means), the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in
cash or by bills of exchange, the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate
consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside
or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), payments made
for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference
period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver
if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

- pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce) and Article 1167
of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) gives the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of
security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

Finally, any international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management and composition
proceedings may be subject to EU Insolvency Regulation.

Luxembourg has exceptionally adopted, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, certain measures including
a suspension of certain procedural deadlines applicable in civil and commercial matters. This suspension of
deadlines applies to the one-month procedural time limit for the insolvency filing obligation provided by
article 440 of the Luxembourg commercial code. In principle, such a suspension of deadlines should (i) not
prevent directors / managers of a Luxembourg company from filing for bankruptcy (if the conditions
thereof are met) and (ii) not restrict the rights of creditors to petition for bankruptcy of a Luxembourg
company. Based on the current legislation, suspension of delays to file for bankruptcy within one month
should remain in place until 30 June 2021.

**_Limitation on enforcement of security interests_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei
_sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the security interests (such as a_
pledge) are situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such
assets.

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of
pledges over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as shares in Luxembourg
companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law
and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are
held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

The Luxembourg law of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the ‘‘Collateral
**Act 2005’’) governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares (such as**
registered shares in Luxembourg companies or bearer shares physically located in Luxembourg), bank
accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005,
the perfection of pledges depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A
share pledge over registered shares in a Luxembourg company must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by
the company which has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’
register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional
registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge under a receivables pledge agreement
will be validly created and perfected provided that the pledge under such receivables pledge agreement is
executed by the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has not been notified of such receivables pledge or
if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it
pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank
so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in
respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to,
acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out
enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited
to:

- appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value
determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties;

498


-----

- sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares) or
(iii) by way of a public auction;

- court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following
a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

- set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method
chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to
involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges
might be substantially delayed.

The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges and
transfer of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if
entered into during the hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators
and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation,
national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting any one of the parties except
in case of fraud. Where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into by a party subject to
Luxembourg proceedings on the day of but after the opening of such proceedings or the coming into force
of reorganization measures, such arrangement is valid and binding against third parties, administrators,
insolvency receivers, liquidators or similar bodies, if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the
fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not
reasonably be aware of them pursuant to Article 21 (2) of the Collateral Act 2005.

The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party
creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may
seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of
the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred
rights by operation of law).

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be
enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security
interests/ arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any
receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets
located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the relevant Luxembourg security provider or
Luxembourg guarantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg
courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets,
except if ‘main insolvency proceedings’ (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under
Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights _in rem over assets located in_
another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies in accordance with article 8 of the
EU Insolvency Regulation.

Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the
extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible
restrictions depending on the type of security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the
Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the
collateral takers, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether
present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined.
Without prejudice to their obligations vis-`a-vis third-party beneficiaries of such financial collateral, persons
acting on behalf of the third-party beneficiaries of a financial collateral, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit
from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of a financial collateral under the Collateral Act
2005.

**_Luxembourg on enforcement of Notes Guarantees_**

Guarantees executed by a Luxembourg company may be subject to limitations. The Luxembourg act dated
August 10, 1915, as amended (the ‘‘Companies Act 1915’’), does not provide for rules governing the ability
of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. It is
generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest (int´erˆet social) of each individual
corporate entity should, to a certain extent, be tempered by, and subordinated to, the interest of the group.

499


-----

A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest
of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion with the real financial
means of the assisting company or have a reciprocal character. A company may give a guarantee provided
the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate objects (objet social) and is in the
corporate interest (int´erˆet social) of the company. The test regarding the guarantor’s corporate interest is
whether the companies involved form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed
at a common objective, whether the company that provides the guarantee receives some consideration in
return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) or there is a balance between the respective
commitments of the relevant members of the group, and whether the benefit is proportional to the burden
of the assistance. A guarantee that substantially exceeds the guarantor company’s ability to meet its
obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its directors or
managers to personal liability. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the managers of the
Luxembourg company might incur criminal penalties based on the concept of misappropriation of
corporate assets (article 1500-11- of the Companies Act 1915). It cannot be excluded ultimately that, if the
relevant transaction were to be considered as a misappropriation of corporate assets by a Luxembourg
court or if it could be evidenced that the other parties to the transaction were aware of the fact that the
transaction was not for the corporate benefit of the Luxembourg company, the transaction might be
declared void or ineffective based on the concept of illegal cause (cause illicite). To mitigate these risks, the
up-stream / cross-stream guarantees granted by a Luxembourg guarantor will be limited to a certain
percentage of, among others, the relevant company’s net worth (capitaux propres) and intragroup liabilities
as reflected in the financial statement of the relevant Luxembourg guarantor.

A guarantee granted by a Luxembourg company could, if submitted to a Luxembourg court, depending on
the terms of such guarantee, possibly be construed by such court as a suretyship (cautionnement) and not as
a first demand guarantee or an independent guarantee. Article 2012 of the Luxembourg civil code provides
that the validity and the enforceability of a suretyship (which constitutes an accessory obligation) are
subject to the validity of the underlying obligation. It follows that if the underlying obligations were invalid
or challenged, it cannot be excluded that a Luxembourg guarantor would be released from its liabilities
under the Notes Guarantee.

**United States**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States, have their registered offices
in the United States or currently have, or may in the future have, property located in the United States
(each such Guarantor, a ‘‘U.S. Provider’’). Insolvency proceedings may, therefore, be initiated in respect of
one or more of the U.S. Providers in the United States. U.S. law would then govern those proceedings. A
voluntary bankruptcy case may be commenced by us in respect of a U.S. Provider, or an involuntary
bankruptcy case could be commenced by certain unsecured creditors of a U.S. Provider, in each case as
provided under title 11 of the United States Code (the ‘‘U.S. Bankruptcy Code’’). The Issuers and direct or
indirect subsidiaries of the Issuers that are not U.S. Providers may also be eligible to be debtors in cases
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code where, among other things, they have now or later acquired property
located in the United States.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, under certain
circumstances:

(i) the issuance of the Note Guarantees and the grant of security in the Collateral by the U.S. Providers
could be avoided or set aside;

(ii) the holders of the Notes could be required to repay certain amounts received in connection with a
Note Guarantee or the exercises of rights in Collateral;

(iii) claims in respect of such obligations or liens could be subordinated to some or all of the other debts
and other liabilities of a U.S. Provider; and

(iv) the right of the Security Trustee to repossess and dispose of Collateral of a U.S. Provider upon an
event of default under the Indenture governing the Notes will be governed by U.S. bankruptcy law if
such U.S. Provider commences U.S. bankruptcy proceedings before such repossession or disposal
occurs.

_Federal and State Insolvency Proceedings_

U.S. Providers may be subject to federal bankruptcy laws under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or applicable
state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a debtor
with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code
provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to:
(a) the administration of a bankruptcy case, including the provision of ‘‘adequate protection’’ to secured
creditors, the automatic stay, terms for the use, sale or lease of property, standards for obtaining credit and
the treatment of executory contracts and leases; (b) creditors and claims, including filing proofs of claim,
priority and allowance of claims, rights of secured creditors and subordination of claims; (c) provisions
relating to the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and turnover
and avoidance actions; and (d) liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; reorganization
under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; and ancillary and cross-border insolvency cases under
chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the
debtor’s assets by a trustee. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to
rehabilitate their businesses and work out their obligations to creditors. Unlike in chapter 7, the debtor in a
chapter 11 case typically remains in control of its assets and continues to operate its business during the
course of the bankruptcy case. In addition, ‘‘liquidating’’ chapter 11 cases are a frequently utilized
alternative to chapter 7 liquidations, especially where the conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a case
under chapter 7 might prove prohibitively expensive or in an instance when a debtor expects to sell all or
substantially all of its assets. Because bankruptcy proceedings tend to be fact specific and vary case by case
and because U.S. bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed
summary of all of the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or of potential outcomes in a U.S.
bankruptcy case that could impact the Notes, the Collateral or the Notes Guarantees is not contained
herein.

With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit of
creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms and/or dissolution mechanisms), the effects
and extent of these proceedings are fact-specific, vary from state to state and require an examination of
both statutory and common law, the details of which also are not described herein. To the extent more
information is required, potential investors in the Notes should consult an insolvency professional familiar
with U.S. and the applicable state insolvency laws.

_Delay and risks associated in a federal bankruptcy proceeding_

If a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by or against any U.S.
Provider, it is likely that delays would occur in enforcing the Notes Guarantees or Collateral granted by the
bankrupt U.S. Provider, because of specific provisions of such laws or by a court applying general
principles of equity. Aspects of federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that could result in
the impairment of rights include, but are not limited to:

- the ‘‘automatic stay’’ (i.e. creditor moratorium);

- avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee or debtor-in-possession;

- substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of multiple entities;

- limitations on collectability of unmatured interest or attorney fees;

- avoidance of fraudulent transfers by a trustee or debtor-in-possession; and

- forced restructuring of the obligations of bankrupt company including obligations under the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees, including reduction of principal amounts and interest rates and extension
of maturity dates, over noteholders’ objections.

As an initial matter, the commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an automatic stay, applicable to all
creditors, of all litigation against the debtor and efforts to collect prepetition claims, enforce existing liens
or impose new liens, subject to limited exceptions. The purpose of the stay is to provide the chapter 11
debtor time to reorganize and the chapter 7 trustee protection under which to liquidate in an orderly
fashion the debtor’s assets for the benefit of creditors. The automatic stay is also intended to shield a
debtor from the pressures of creditor collection efforts. Among other things, the automatic stay prohibits
(a) all collection efforts by creditors, (b) the enforcement of prepetition judgments against the debtor or

501


-----

property of the estate, (c) any act to create, perfect or enforce a lien against property of the estate and
(d) the set-off of prepetition debts owing to the debtor against debts owing by the debtor. The automatic
stay ordinarily does not bar suits against non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors, nor does it enjoin payment
under a letter of credit issued by a bank in favor of a creditor of the applicable debtor. Applicable federal
bankruptcy laws generally do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees for
unsecured or ‘‘undersecured’’ claims.

_Fraudulent transfer issues_

Under Section 544 and/or 548 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and comparable provisions of state fraudulent
transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or voidable transactions laws (collectively, ‘‘U.S. Fraudulent Transfer
**Laws’’), the incurrence of obligations under the Note Guarantees or grant of security interests in the**
Collateral by any U.S. Provider could be avoided if, among other things, a court determined that at the
time the U.S. Provider entered into the Note Guarantees (or, in some jurisdictions, when payment
becomes due under a relevant Note Guarantee) or granted the security interests in Collateral, such U.S.
Provider (i) incurred the obligations under the Note Guarantee or granted security interests in Collateral
with actual intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration in return for incurring such obligations or such security interests, in
the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

- such U.S. Provider was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of obligation under
the Note Guarantee or the grant of security interests in Collateral;

- the incurrence of obligations under the Note Guarantee or grant of security interests in Collateral left
such U.S. Provider with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on our or its business; or

- such U.S. Provider intended to, or believed that it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as they mature.

A U.S. court would likely find that a U.S. Provider did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the incurrence of obligations under a Note Guarantee or the grant of security interests in
Collateral if such U.S. Provider did not benefit directly or indirectly from the same. Given that the Note
Guarantees furnished by the U.S. Providers are upstream guarantees, there is a risk that a U.S. court may
determine that one or more of the U.S. Providers did not receive reasonably equivalent value in return for
entering into the Note Guarantees and granting security interests in Collateral.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a U.S. Provider would be
considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including probable contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value
of all its assets;

- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

- it could not pay its debts as they become due.

However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency
determinations, and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. In an
evidentiary ruling in the _In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the_
District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is
rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor, and not what the
transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s analysis,
liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the
time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If
the principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a
transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be
found to be a fraudulent transfer.

If the Note Guarantees were avoided or limited under U.S. Fraudulent Transfer Laws or other laws, any
claim you may make against the relevant U.S. Provider in relation to amounts payable in connection with
the Notes, the Note Guarantees, or the Collateral would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance

502


-----

or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by U.S.
Provider in connection with any such avoidance or limitation.

By their terms, the Note Guarantees of each U.S. Provider will limit that U.S. Provider’s liability under the
relevant Note Guarantee to the maximum amount it can pay without the Note Guarantee being deemed a
fraudulent transfer. However, these provisions contained in the Note Guarantees may not be effective to
protect the guarantees from being avoided under U.S. Fraudulent Transfer Laws, or may reduce a U.S.
Provider’s payment obligations to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee of the Notes issued
hereby worthless.

In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy, claims in respect of liens or
obligations evidenced by the Note Guarantees or Collateral may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated
under the equitable subordination provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

_Preference issues_

Any payment made or pledge of collateral to a creditor on account of pre-existing debt in favor of only
certain creditors might be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy
if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the pledgor is insolvent at the
time of the pledge, the pledge allows the pledgees to receive a greater recovery than it would otherwise
receive in a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is
commenced within 90 days following the pledge, or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees (together, the ‘‘Securities’’) have not been, and will not be, registered
under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not

the Securities offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in
Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore
transactions to non-U.S. persons outside of the United States (in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in

any person representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer
or sale of any of the Securities, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum,
which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its
investment decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers
nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in connection with its
decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers;

(4) The purchaser is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts
for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case, for investment, and not with a view to, or for

thereof will be deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer
any Securities or any beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so prior to the date which is, in the
case of Securities offered to qualified institutional buyers, one year after the later of the original issue
date of such Securities, the original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the last
date on which the relevant Issuer or any affiliate of the relevant Issuer was the owner of such Security
(or any predecessor of such Security) and, in the case of Securities offered to non-U.S. persons in
accordance with Regulation S, 40 days after the later of the original issue date of such Security and the

relevant Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that
has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Securities are eligible for

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the
Notes (or any interest therein) by (i) employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the U.S.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’)) that are subject to Title I of
ERISA; (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements (as described in Section 4975 of
the Code) that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code; (iii) entities and accounts whose underlying assets
are considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ (within the meaning of regulations issued by the United States
Department of Labor (the ‘‘DOL’’), set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of
ERISA (the ‘‘Plan Asset Regulations’’)) of such plans, accounts and arrangements (‘‘Plan Assets’’); and
(iv) governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) that are not
subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to provisions under
any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’) (each of the foregoing, a ‘‘Plan’’).

**General Fiduciary Considerations**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ‘‘ERISA Plan’’) and prohibit certain transactions involving Plan
Assets and their fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who
exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the
management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or
other compensation to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such ERISA Plan.

When considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws relating to the fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan, including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws. No representation is made
that the sale of any Notes to a Plan meets the fiduciary requirements for investments by Plans generally or
any particular Plan or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.
None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers or any of the parties described in this offering
memorandum, or their respective affiliates, is providing any advice or recommendation to any Plan,
including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, through this offering memorandum or otherwise, in
connection with the sale of the Notes. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by
each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction and Plan Asset Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving Plan Assets with persons or entities, including fiduciaries, who are ‘‘parties in
interest,’’ within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons,’’ within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that are not
subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may be subject to similar
provisions under applicable Similar Laws. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes (or any interest
therein) by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result
in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code,
unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, administrative,
class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the DOL has issued prohibited
transaction class exemptions (‘‘PTCEs’’) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These
exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent
qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts,
PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting insurance company
general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Further,
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may also provide exemptive relief;

provided that neither the Issuers nor any of their affiliates has or exercises any discretionary authority or
control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the
acquisition or holding of the Notes and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no
more, than ‘‘adequate compensation’’ (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) in connection with such acquisition and holding. There can be no
assurance that any of the PTCEs or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving the Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption is available, it will cover
all aspects of any particular transaction. Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding
the prohibited transaction rules and these exemptions.

Under the Plan Asset Regulations, the assets of the Issuers would be treated as Plan Assets of an ERISA
Plan if the ERISA Plan acquires an equity interest in the Issuers and none of the exceptions contained in
the Plan Asset Regulations is applicable. If the underlying assets of the Issuers are deemed to be Plan
Assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of sponsors, fiduciaries and plan administrators of the
ERISA Plans, and of parties in interest and disqualified persons (as defined under ERISA and the Code),
under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be
expanded, and there may be an increase in their exposure to liability under these and other provisions of
ERISA and the Code (except to the extent (if any) that a favorable statutory or administrative exemption
or exception applies). An ‘‘equity interest’’ is defined under the Plan Asset Regulations as an interest in an
entity other than an instrument which is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has
no substantial equity features. Although there is little guidance on the subject and no assurance can be
given, at the time of their issuance, the Notes may not be treated as equity interests of the Issuers for
purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. That determination is based, in part, upon the traditional debt
features of the Notes, including the reasonable expectation of purchasers of such Notes that such Notes
will be repaid when due, as well as the absence of conversion rights, warrants and other typical equity
features.

The Notes (and interests therein) should not be acquired or held by any person investing the assets of any
Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition would not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation
of any Similar Laws.

**Representations and Covenants**

By acceptance of a Note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and transferee of such Note (or any
interest therein) will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed, among other things, that
either (a) it is not, and for so long as it holds such Note (or any interest therein) it will not be, a Plan and
no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold such Note or any interest
therein constitutes assets of any Plan; or (b) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or any
interest therein) does not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws. Each purchaser and
transferee of the Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have represented, warranted and
agreed, among other things, that it will not transfer the Notes (or any interest therein) to any person or
entity, unless such person or entity is deemed to and could itself truthfully make the foregoing
representations and covenants.

Each purchaser and transferee of any Notes (or any interest therein) that is, or is acting on behalf of, an
ERISA Plan shall be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Issuers, the Guarantors,
the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates has provided any investment recommendation or
investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the ERISA Plan
(‘‘Plan Fiduciary’’), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Notes, and
they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or
Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA
Plan’s acquisition of the Notes, and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in
evaluating the investment in the Notes.

**Other Matters**

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of**
**these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited**
**transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the**

509


-----

**Notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel**
**regarding the potential applicability of Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar**
**Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the**
**Notes (or any interest therein). Purchasers and transferees of the Notes (or any interest therein) have**
**exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes (or any interest therein)**
**does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws. The**
**sale of any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial**
**Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant**
**legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan generally or any particular Plan, or that**
**such investment is appropriate for such Plans generally or any particular Plan.**

In addition, the foregoing discussion is based upon the provisions of ERISA and the Code and related
guidance in effect as of the date of this offering memorandum. Future legislation, court decisions,
administrative regulations or other guidance may change the requirements summarized in this section. Any
of these changes could be made retroactively and could apply to transactions entered into before the
change is enacted.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuers have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase
from the Issuers, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes will be made pursuant to
a purchase agreement among the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final
offering memorandum (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase the Notes from the Issuers, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the
Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price
at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into
the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer
intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S.
registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to
investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuers have agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in
connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.
The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of
the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuers and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold
harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and
will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We
have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers and the Guarantors or any of
their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the
Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering
without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date
of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States
by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the
Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of
the Notes are restricted as described under ‘‘Notice to Certain Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to any Issuer or any Guarantor; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, ‘‘retail investor’’

511


-----

means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) ‘‘retail client’’ as defined in point (11) of
MiFID II; or (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key
information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of
the EEA that is subject to the Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment
in respect of the securities described in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such securities is ECPs and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term
‘‘manufacturers’’ shall mean such of the Joint Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners as are subject to
the product governance rules under MiFID II.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, ‘‘retail investor’’
means a person who is on (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2
of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK
PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the securities described in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in COBS and professional
clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the
term ‘‘manufacturers’’ shall mean such of the Joint Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners as are
subject to the product governance rules under COBS and UK MiFIR.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any

512


-----

restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale
of the Notes. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

The Issuers have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the
safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Issuers will apply, through their Listing Agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on
the Official List of the Exchange; however, the Issuers cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained
or, if obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the
Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series
_of Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.’’_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales
in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing
transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids
do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open
market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the
Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by
that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their respective behalfs,
may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the respective series of
Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the
purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also
over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the
open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and
purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose
penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above
market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the
liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—
_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.’’_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on
or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and,
if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these
activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of
the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in
the over the counter market or otherwise.

Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the U.S. Exchange Act)
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be
made against payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum,
which will be ten business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being
referred to as ‘‘T+10.’’ Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Notes on the date of this offering
memorandum or the next succeeding seven business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who
wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,

513


-----

investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently
providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking,
various lending, hedging, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under
bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or
may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will act as
mandated lead arrangers and original lenders, as applicable under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which
we will enter into as borrowers and draw to provide financing for the Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers
and their respective affiliates may act as counterparties in hedging arrangements. In addition, UBS AG (or
one of its affiliates) advised the Seller on the Acquisition. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates have provided a bridge facility that will be cancelled on the Issue Date. In connection with their
services in such capacities, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received, or will receive,
customary fees.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours
or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also
make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short
positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**England and Wales**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England and
Wales is based upon advice provided to us by our English legal advisors. The United States and the United
Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment of a U.S. federal or state court in relation to the obligations of the relevant Issuer under Notes
will not be automatically enforceable in England and Wales. However, a final and conclusive judgment for
a debt or definite sum of money may be enforced at common law in England and Wales provided that the
party against whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts (in
accordance with English rules on the conflict of laws), and none of the following circumstances applies:

- the judgment was procured by fraud;

- the judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for example the
defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an adequate
opportunity to be heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the opportunity to
correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment;

- recognition of the judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

- recognition of the judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

- the judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is enforceable in an
English court;

- the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration
agreement or a contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of the
judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982;

- enforcement of the judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or penalties (which
involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law;

- enforcement of the judgment would contravene the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980,
Section 5 of which precludes, among other things, the enforcement by any court in the United
Kingdom of any judgment given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple
damages which exceed the compensatory element of the judgment award; or

- enforcement of the judgment is time-barred or outside any limitation periods.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be enforceable in England and Wales.

In addition, an English court may decline to accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original
action was commenced in England and Wales in breach of a binding arbitration agreement or a contractual
choice of court agreement.

**Switzerland**

Swiss Holdco and Swiss Midco and some Post-Closing Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of
Switzerland. Most of our directors and executive officers live outside the United States. A substantial
portion of our assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside the United
States. As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Indentures
governing the Notes, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States
or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the
securities laws of the United States.

If an appointment for service of process had been validly revoked by a Swiss Guarantor, or if the service of
process should be delivered to a Swiss Guarantor in Switzerland, the service of process would have to be
made in accordance with the Hague Convention of November 15, 1965 on the service abroad of judicial or
extra judicial documents abroad in civil and commercial matters, as amended.

Judgments in civil or commercial matters of a non-Swiss court or authority will be recognized and enforced
against an individual or a legal entity with legal domicile or seat (or assets) in Switzerland pursuant to an

515


-----

applicable bilateral or multilateral treaty or convention between the foreign country and Switzerland,
e.g., the Lugano Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments of October 30, 2007 (to which
neither the United States of America nor any of its States are a party). In case no applicable treaty or
convention exists, the rules of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber das
_Internationale Privatrecht, ‘‘PILA’’) apply._

Except for arbitral awards, there is currently no treaty or convention in effect pertaining to the recognition
and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the United States of America and
Switzerland. Thus, art. 25 through 32 PILA apply to the recognition and enforcement of a U.S. federal or
state court judgment in Switzerland. In cases where a U.S. monetary judgment shall be enforced, the Swiss
Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (Bundesgesetz ¨uber Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) and
the Swiss Code of Civil Procedure (Schweizerische Zivilprozessordnung) applies in addition to the PILA.

A United States judgment may be recognized and enforced upon request by the courts of Switzerland if
certain requirements of the PILA and/or any other applicable international treaty to which Switzerland is a
party are met. In instances where the PILA applies, these requirements include that:

- the Swiss court determines that the foreign court had proper jurisdiction from a Swiss law perspective;

- the judgment of such foreign court has become final and non-appealable;

- the recognition of the foreign judgment is not manifestly contrary to the public policy or the law in
Switzerland;

- the counterparty has been properly served with process according to the law of the state of his/her/its
domicile or ordinary residence (if in Switzerland, through judicial aid granted by the Swiss authorities)
or the counterparty has unconditionally joined the proceedings;

- the proceedings leading to the judgment have respected the principles of a fair trial (as understood in
Switzerland) and, in particular, that the counterparty has been granted the right to be heard and the
possibility to properly defend his/her/its case; and

- no action between the same parties and on the same subject matter has been commenced or decided
first in a Swiss court and no judgment between the same parties and on the same subject matter has
been first rendered by a foreign court, which judgment may be recognized in Switzerland.

Further, valid submission to the jurisdiction of a foreign court, in particular of a U.S. court or authority, is
established (i) if a provision of the PILA so provides or, in the absence of such provision, the defendant
had his legal domicile in the country in which the decision was rendered; or (ii) if parties who, in a
pecuniary dispute, entered into an agreement valid under PILA, submitted their dispute to the jurisdiction
of the court or authority which rendered the judgment; or (iii) if the defendant, in a pecuniary dispute,
proceeded on the merits without objecting to jurisdiction; or (iv) if, in the event of a counterclaim, the
court or authority which rendered the decision had jurisdiction over the principal claim and there is a
factual connection between the principal claim and the counterclaim. It is uncertain whether this practice
extends to default judgments as well.

Moreover, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement
and recognition of proceedings in Switzerland are governed by the provisions of the Swiss Civil Procedure
Code. The judgment of a Swiss court or authority of first instance concerning recognition and enforcement
of a foreign judgment, including a U.S. judgment, is generally subject to appeal (on the cantonal level as
well as on the federal level).

Subject to the foregoing, noteholders may be able to enforce in Switzerland judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from United States federal or state courts; however, it cannot be assured that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable. It is doubtful whether a Swiss court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in Switzerland predicated solely upon
United States federal or state securities laws. In addition, in an action brought in a Swiss court on the basis
of United States federal or state/ securities laws, the Swiss courts may not have the requisite power to grant
the remedies sought. Awards of punitive damages awarded in original actions outside Switzerland may also
not be enforceable in Switzerland.

Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the
production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel

516


-----

the production of documents by adverse or third-parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. In principle, no such pre-trial
discovery process exists under Swiss law. No statement can be made as to the time and efficiency of the
recognition and enforcement in Switzerland of a foreign judgment considering that recognition and
enforcement proceedings tend to be time consuming in Switzerland.

Under Swiss law, any amount denominated in a foreign currency which has to be enforced through Swiss
debt collection authorities (schweizerische Zwangsvollstreckungsbeh¨orden) has to be converted into Swiss
francs.

**Luxembourg**

A valid judgment against a Luxembourg issuer or a Luxembourg company with respect to the notes
obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force
and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto
have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg
subject to the following conditions:

(i) the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under
its applicable laws, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local
law;

(ii) the judgment is final and enforceable (ex´ecutoire) in the jurisdiction where the decision is
rendered;

(iii) the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws
rules (although some first instance decisions rendered in Luxembourg—without the matter having
been ruled upon yet by the Court of Appeal—no longer apply this condition);

(iv) the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

(v) the judgment must not have been obtained by fraud (fraude `a la loi) subsequent to an evasion of
Luxembourg law and must have been granted in compliance with the rights of the defendant to
appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and

(vi) the judgment must not contravene public policy as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or
have been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature; unless

(vii) such judgment is irreconcilable with a judgment of a Luxembourg court or an earlier judgment of
a foreign court which is recognized in Luxembourg.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law
if, among other things, application of the designated law would contravene Luxembourg public policy.
Furthermore, in an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws,
Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR**

The historical combined and carve-out Financial Statements of the LSI Business as at and for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (including comparative financial information as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2018), included in this offering memorandum, have been audited by KPMG AG,
independent auditor, as stated in its reports appearing herein. KPMG AG, with its business address at
R¨affelstrasse 28, PO Box, CH-8036 Zurich, Switzerland, is registered with the Swiss Expert Association for
Audit, Tax and Fiduciary. KPMG is also registered with the Swiss Federal Audit Oversight Authority,
which is responsible for the licensing and supervision of audit firms and individuals which provide audit
services in Switzerland.

The audit reports covering the historical combined and carve-out Financial Statements of the LSI Business
as at and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (including comparative financial information as
at and for the year ended December 31, 2018) each contain an emphasis of matter paragraph which draws
attention to Note 1 of those Financial Statements, which describes their basis of preparation, including the
approach to and the purpose for preparing them and that the preparation involves complex allocations of
assets, liabilities and costs. Consequently, the LSI Business’ historical combined and carve-out Financial
Statements may not necessarily be indicative of the financial performance that would have been achieved if
the LSI Business had operated as an independent entity, nor may they be indicative of the results of
operations of the LSI Business for any future period. As a result, the historical combined and carve-out
Financial Statements may not be suitable for another purpose. The audit reports were not modified in
respect of this matter.

**BUSINESS’’)**

7JUL201701435476

15APR202108591011

**To the Management of Lonza Group Ltd., Basel**

**Report of the Independent Auditor on the Historical Combined and Carve-out Financial Statements of the**
**Lonza Specialty Ingredients Business as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020**

**Opinion**

We have audited the historical combined and carve-out financial statements of the Specialty Ingredients
Business (‘‘Carve-out Financial Statements of the Lonza Specialty Ingredients Business’’) of Lonza
Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Reporting Entity’’), which comprise the historical combined and
carve-out balance sheet as at 31 December 2020, the historical combined and carve-out income statement,
statement of comprehensive income, cash flow statement and statement of changes in equity, for the year
then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying historical combined and carve-out financial statements give a true and
fair view of the historical combined and carve-out financial position of the Reporting Entity as at
31 December 2020 and its historical combined and carve-out financial performance and its historical
combined and carve-out cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Historical Combined and Carve-out Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Reporting Entity in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession that are
relevant to our audit of the historical combined and carve-out financial statements, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Emphasis of Matter—Basis of Preparation**

We draw attention to Note 1 to the historical combined and carve-out financial statements, which describes
their basis of preparation, including the approach to and the purpose for preparing them and that the
preparation involves complex allocations of assets, liabilities and costs. Consequently, the Reporting
Entity’s historical combined and carve-out financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of the
financial performance that would have been achieved if the Reporting Entity had operated as an
independent entity, nor may they be indicative of the results of operations of the Reporting Entity for any
future period. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Historical Combined and**
**Carve-out Financial Statements**

Management of Lonza Group Ltd. is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
historical combined and carve-out financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of historical combined and
carve-out financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the historical combined and carve-out financial statements, management is responsible for
assessing the Reporting Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the Reporting Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Reporting Entity’s financial reporting
process.

**Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Historical Combined and Carve-out Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the historical combined and carve-out
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of the historical combined and carve-out financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the historical combined and carve-out
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations
or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Reporting Entity’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Reporting Entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in
our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the historical combined and carve-out financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Reporting Entity to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the historical combined and carve-out
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the historical combined and carve-out
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Reporting Entity to express an opinion on the historical combined and
carve-out financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation**

**1.1 Reporting Entity**

The Lonza Specialty Ingredients Business (‘‘LSI Business’’) is a leading provider of microbial-control
solution offerings across various consumer and industrial markets as well as of the specialty chemical
services covering composites and fine chemicals. The LSI Business addresses the coatings, composites and
agricultural markets by offering products and specialty solutions for the protection, enhanced performance
and modification of the end-use characteristics of various materials including carbon, fibers, fabrics,
leather, metals, plastics, stone and wood, as well as for agricultural ingredients.

On 3 June 2019, Lonza Group (‘‘Lonza’’, ‘‘Group’’ or ‘‘Lonza Group’’) announced its intention to proceed
with a carve-out of the LSI Business. The carve-out decision has resulted in Lonza Group operating the
LSI Business under independent management, with increased control over its operations and costs. The
LSI Business remains fully owned by Lonza. Since the announcement, the Group has commenced with the
separation and has substantially completed the carve-out process by implementing key operational changes
to separate key functions including supply chain activities, customer facing roles and other critical
functions, as well as setting up new legal entities. On 23 July 2020, the Group’s Board of Directors decided
to divest the LSI Business via a sale process, which was initiated in the second half of 2020. On 8 February
2021, Lonza announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Bain Capital and Cinven to
divest Lonza’s Specialty Ingredients business and operations. The divestment of the LSI Business is
expected to be completed in the second half of 2021.

The LSI Business has been and will remain part of Lonza Group up to the divestment closing date and,
whilst it represents a separate business, it has not historically existed as a reporting group. Accordingly, to
allow for the evaluation of the LSI Business’ historical financial results, Lonza has prepared historical
combined and carve-out financial statements for each of the years ending 31 December 2020 and 2019
(hereinafter, ‘‘carve-out financial statements’’ or ‘‘carve-out’’). Refer to note 23 for the overview of the
entities included in the carve-out financial statements.

These carve-out financial statements exclude, in all years presented, the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the Consumer Health & Nutrition and Water Care businesses which were both previously
part of the Specialty Ingredients operating segment of Lonza Group. Lonza Group’s Consumer Health &
Nutrition business was transferred from the LSI Business to the Lonza Pharma Biotech & Nutrition
operating segment of Lonza Group as part of a Group wide reorganization, effective as of 1 January 2019.
The related assets, liabilities and results of operations of a small portfolio of Consumer Health & Nutrition
products which are related to the core LSI Business activities were not transferred and are included in
these carve-out financial statements, as part of the LSI Business.

The Water Care business was sold by Lonza Group, effective 28 February 2019, and was presented as
discontinued operations in the Lonza Group financial statements as of and for the year ended
31 December 2019. The Water Care business is not included in these carve-out financial statements.

**1.2 Revision to Comparative Financial Information for 2019**

In 2020, as Lonza Group proceeded with the carve-out of the LSI Business, it made further decisions as to
the allocation of certain specific assets and liabilities between its continuing business and the LSI Business,
resulting in changes to the asset and liability allocation under the carve-out approach already applied in the
preparation of the previously issued LSI Business carve-out financial statements for 2019 and 2018. To
enhance the comparative presentation of the LSI Business’ financial position and results from operations
for 2020 and 2019, certain revisions have therefore been made to the 2019 comparative financial
information included in the 2020 financial statements as compared to the previously issued financial
statements. These changes are presented below and also as applicable throughout the note disclosures, to
enhance comparability of the periods. The impacts of the revisions described below on the 2019 income
statement and cash flow statement are not material.

(1) Refer to Note 4, Property, Plant and Equipment, for the IFRS 16 transition disclosures.

(2) As reported represents balances in the LSI Business’ carve-out financial statements for 2019 and 2018, respectively. As reported
2018 balances are prior to the adoption of IFRS 16 which was effective on 1 January 2019.

The aforementioned LSI Business 2020 carve-out changes have been reflected by revising each of the
affected financial statement line items in the balance sheet as of the years ended 31 December 2019 and
31 December 2018 as follows:

_a)_ _Property, plant and equipment (PP&E)_

In 2020 Group determined that it would retain legal ownership of certain assets previously planned to be
part of the LSI Business to be divested. This resulted in a decrease of PP&E by CHF 28 million and
31 million for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the figures
previously reported. The assets identified are primarily located in the U.S., China and Switzerland.

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

_b)_ _Trade receivables_

In 2020 the Group determined that it would retain legal ownership of certain trade receivables which were
part of a Lonza Group wide securitization program previously planned to be part of the divested LSI
Business resulting in a decrease of trade receivables and other current liabilities by CHF 16 million as of
31 December 2019 compared to the figures previously reported. There were no corresponding
31 December 2018 revisions for these items.

_c)_ _Tax related balances_

In 2020 the Group determined, consistent with the 2020 organizational carve-outs of its Group and LSI
Business US tax structure certain current tax receivables and payables are to be allocated to the LSI
Business. As a result current tax receivables increased by CHF 10 million for the year ended 31 December
2018, while current tax payables decreased by CHF 7 million and 5 million for the years ended
31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018, respectively.

_d)_ _Other revisions_

Represents other revisions which are not considered individually material but are related to the 2020
allocation of certain specific assets and liabilities between Lonza Group’s continuing business and the LSI
Business, resulting in changes to the asset and liability allocation under the carve-out approach already
applied in the preparation of the previously issued LSI Business carve-out financial statements for 2019
and 2018.

**1.3 Basis of Preparation**

The carve-out financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), reflecting
the fact that the LSI Business has been carved out from the larger Lonza Group.

IFRS provides no specific guidelines for the preparation of combined, carve-out financial statements,
which are therefore subject to the rules outlined in IAS 8.12. This guidance requires consideration of the
most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and
recognized industry practices.

The carve-out financial statements have been prepared based on the extraction approach, with the IFRS
consolidated financial statements of Lonza Group Ltd. and subsidiaries as of 31 December 2020
authorized for issue by the Lonza Group Ltd. Board of Directors on 16 March 2021, being the primary
basis for the preparation of the carve-out financial statements of the LSI Business. The net assets and
related historical results of the LSI Business for the year ended 31 December 2020 have been extracted
from the Lonza Group consolidated financial statements. Hence, the carrying amounts of the assets and
liabilities recognized in the Lonza Group consolidated financial statements and related to the LSI Business
are generally included in the carve-out financial statements of the LSI Business. In the Lonza Group
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, the assets and liabilities related to
LSI were reclassified to assets and liabilities of a disposal group held for sale as of 1 October 2020 and
depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets was not recorded for the remainder of 2020. The LSI
carve-out financial statements for each of the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 include a full year
of depreciation and amortization related to the LSI Business’ assets.

As a general principle, the LSI Business uses the same accounting policies and principles in these carve-out
financial statements as were used for the preparation of Lonza Group’s consolidated financial statements.

The carve-out financial statements comprise balance sheets, income statements, statements of
comprehensive income, cash flow statements, statements of changes in equity and notes to the carve-out
financial statements.

The accounting policies and principles used in preparing these carve-out financial statements, which are
based on the historical cost convention unless stated otherwise, are the same as those used for the
preparation of the Lonza Group’s consolidated financial statements. Detailed disclosures on measurement
are provided in the summary of significant accounting policies. These policies have been consistently
applied to all the reporting periods presented, unless stated otherwise.

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

_Allocation of assets, liabilities and costs_

Transactions and balances previously reported in the Lonza Group consolidated financial statements as
part of the Specialty Ingredients operating segment have been directly attributed to the LSI Business.
Transactions and balances previously not directly attributed to the LSI Business or Lonza Group’s Pharma
Biotech & Nutrition Business (‘‘LPBN Business’’) have been allocated based on the below explained
methodology:

- Property, plant and equipment (‘‘PPE’’) has, in general, been specifically assigned to either the LSI
Business or LPBN Business based on the expected future user of the asset. The allocation of
employee related assets such as office furniture or computer equipment has been performed
according to the historical split of average full-time employees (‘‘FTE’’) attributable to either the LSI
Business or the LPBN Business.

- Right-of-Use assets and lease liabilities have, in general, been specifically assigned to either the LSI
Business or LPBN Business based on the expected future user of the asset. The carve-out approach
for leased assets is in alignment with the approach applied for owned PPE to ensure consistency in the
LSI carve-out financial statements. If management does not expect that a lease contract will be
allocated to LSI in the carve-out organizational structure, it remains with LPBN.

- Intangible assets mainly relating to software, have been allocated between the LSI Business and
the LPBN Business either based on the relative usage (either the historical relative percentage of
number of users of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business or the historical relative percentage of
number of FTEs of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business) or the expected future user of the asset.

- The LSI Business’ goodwill recorded in these carve-out financial statements originated as a result of
various acquisitions over the lifecycle of Lonza Group prior to the years presented. The allocation of
goodwill to the LSI Business is, solely for the purpose of these carve-out financial statements, based
on the historical allocation of goodwill to the LSI Business as previously defined and reported as in
the Specialty Ingredients operating segment of Lonza Group. The carrying value of the goodwill
allocated to the LSI Business for the purposes of the preparation of the carve-out financial statements
has been assessed for impairment. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units), consistent
with the impairment testing conducted at the level of the Specialty Ingredients operating segment of
Lonza Group. As Lonza entered into a definitive agreement to sell the LSI Business in 2021, the
recoverable amount of the LSI Business’ cash-generating units is based on the ‘‘fair value less cost to
sell’’ calculation. The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets are expected to be covered by
the expected proceeds from the sale (refer to Note 24).

- Inventories have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or LPBN Business considering
whether inventories were predominantly used by either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business in the
respective year. Where this was not possible, balances have been allocated based on the relative
historical percentage of net sales of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business.

- Receivables have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business based on
the business activities where the related sales originated from. Where this was not possible, balances
have been allocated based on the relative historical percentage of net sales of the LSI Business and
the LPBN Business.

- Accrued liabilities have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business
based on the business activities where the related costs were incurred. Where this was not possible,
balances were allocated either based on the historical relative percentage of net sales of the LSI
Business or LPBN Business or using the historical relative percentage of the average number of FTEs
of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business depending on the specific nature of the balance.

- Debt and financial liabilities have been allocated to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business
based on the historical usage of the proceeds from the debt. If debt may not be specifically allocated
to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business, the related liability has been allocated based on the
future obligor of the debt.

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

- Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments include interest rates,
foreign exchange rates (‘‘FX’’) and commodities. In 2019, one variable term loan related to the LSI
Business (economic and legal borrower Lonza America Inc., guaranteed by Lonza Group AG), was
allocated to the LSI Business, consequently, the related derivative financial instruments (interest rate
swaps), were also allocated to the LSI Business. In 2020, the intercompany debt structure of Lonza
America Inc. was restructured in anticipation of the planned divestiture of the LSI Business. As a
result, the related derivative financial instruments were reassigned to Lonza Group. FX derivatives
are traded back-to-back (third party trade with banks and Lonza’s Group treasury department and the
internal (IC) trade between Lonza Group’s treasury department and the LPBN and LSI Business),
therefore these instruments were also assigned to the relevant business (either the LPBN Business or
the LSI Business). Commodity contracts are used to hedge certain purchases of propane, butane and
naphtha. Those contracts have been historically recorded in the LSI Business and accordingly no
carve-out allocations were required from the historical reported amounts (refer to note 22).

- Trade and other payables have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or the LPBN
Business based on the historical business activities where the related costs were incurred. Where this
was not possible, balances have been allocated to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business based
on the historical relative percentage of net sales of the LSI Business or LPBN Business.

- All environmental and restructuring provisions have been assigned to the LSI Business’ carve-out
financial statements if the LSI Business is considered to be the liable party in the future (post
divestment of the LSI Business by Lonza Group).

- Corporate overhead functions of the Lonza Group include, but are not limited to, IT, finance, tax
planning, internal audit and HR. Costs incurred by these functions have been allocated based on the
relative percentage of net sales of the LSI Business or the LPBN Business. Lonza Group management
considers this allocation to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the
benefits received by the LSI Business during the periods presented. However, the allocation may not
be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had the LSI Business been
operating as a separate entity apart from Lonza Group. The expenses allocation is reflected as
transactions with the Lonza Group (refer to note 21).

The management of Lonza Group believes that the basis of preparation described above results in the
financial information appropriately reflecting the assets and liabilities associated with the LSI Business and
a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by LSI Business
during the periods presented relative to the total revenue, income and costs incurred by Lonza Group.
However, as the LSI Business did not operate as a stand-alone entity during the relevant periods, the
financial information may not be indicative of the LSI Business’ future performance and does not
necessarily reflect what its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had the
LSI Business operated as a separate entity apart from the Lonza Group during the relevant periods.

For an overview of the major individual components and scope of the combination of the LSI Business
refer to note 23.

_Transactions with Lonza Group (note 21)_

Transactions between the LSI Business and Lonza Group entities outside the scope of the LSI Business
have not been eliminated and are reported as related party transactions in these carve-out financial
statements.

_Capital Structure_

The LSI Business has not previously formed a separate legal group nor prepared any stand-alone financial
statements as a separate legal group, and accordingly it is not conceivable to present share capital or an
analysis of equity reserves. The equity of the LSI Business, shown as ‘‘equity attributable to Lonza Group’’,
consists of the net assets attributable to the LSI Business (including accumulated other comprehensive
income) and represents the cumulative net investment by Lonza Group in the LSI Business through the
dates presented, inclusive of cumulative operating net results. Changes in net assets allocated to the LSI
Business are presented separately in the carve-out statement of changes in equity attributable to Lonza
Group through ‘‘Transactions with Lonza Group’’ and in the cash flow statements through ‘‘Transactions

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

with Lonza Group, net’’, reflecting the activity between Lonza Group and the LSI Business during the
periods presented.

These carve-out financial statements are presented in Swiss Francs, which is Lonza Group’s reporting
currency. The individual LSI Business entities also have other functional currencies. Translation
differences arising from translating the results for the period and equity are recognized in equity
attributable to Lonza Group, assets and liabilities and their changes are presented in other comprehensive
income. The LSI Business’ external financing has historically been administered centrally by Lonza Group.

Refer to note 11 for the internal and external debt financing identified which is attributable to the
operations of the LSI Business for the financial year 2020.

_Pensions and similar obligations (note 19)_

Certain of Lonza Group’s subsidiaries operate their own pension plans. For the preparation of the
carve-out financial statements, the pension schemes applicable for the LSI Business’ employees were
analyzed. Where the respective LSI Business legal entity is not the sponsor of the pension scheme and no
stated policy is in place to recharge the pension cost from the Lonza Group to the LSI Business, the plan
has been treated as a multiemployer scheme and the employer records its contributions into the pension
scheme as an expense. Where the sponsor (legal entity) is within the scope of the LSI Business’ carve-out
financial statements, a defined benefit obligation has been reflected in the carve-out financial statements.

_Cash, cash equivalent and cash management (note 9)_

Historically, Lonza Group has performed certain cash management functions on behalf of the LSI
Business. Where the LSI Business participated in cash pooling and certain intercompany loan
arrangements were managed by the Lonza Group, amounts collected (paid) into the cash pool on behalf of
LSI Business are treated as capital contributions from or distributions to Lonza Group and presented in
the carve-out balance sheets as equity attributable to Lonza Group.

Cash and cash equivalents presented on the carve-out balance sheet exclusively relates to balances held by
legal entities which are part of the LSI Business. None of Lonza Group’s cash and cash equivalents have
been allocated to the LSI Business in the carve-out balance sheet.

_Income taxes and deferred taxes (note 18)_

Income taxes are determined based on the assumption that the components of the LSI Business are
separately taxable entities. This assumption implies that the current and deferred taxes of all components
within the LSI Business are calculated separately, and the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is also
assessed accordingly.

Due to the fact that certain components of the LSI Business did not file separate tax returns in previous
years (as for this economic activity consolidated tax returns have been or are to be filed by a Lonza Group
legal entity), the respective current tax assets and liabilities, as well as the deferred tax assets on net
operating losses, are deemed either contributed or distributed to the respective Lonza Group entity filing
the tax return, with a corresponding effect in the equity attributable to Lonza Group as of the end of the
respective fiscal year.

Management considers the approach of separately taxable entities to be the most appropriate methodology
for these carve-out financial statements purposes, but not necessarily indicative of the tax charge or benefit
that would have arisen if the LSI Business had been subject to tax separately. In preparing the carve-out
financial statements for the LSI Business, management did not include any estimated taxation impacts
related to the future divestiture of the LSI business, as the carve out financial statements are historical, and
the divestiture did not occur during the periods presented.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax basis of the LSI Business’ assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts, using currently enacted or substantively enacted tax rates.

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

_Uncertainties due to estimates in the carve-out financial statements_

The carve-out financial information presented herein does not necessarily reflect the net assets, financial
position and results of operations, as well as the capital structure and the cash flows that would have
resulted if the LSI Business had already existed as an independent group during the periods presented.
The absence of any historical unit and independence of the LSI Business limits the informative value of the
carve-out financial information for these reasons. It is therefore also not possible to use the carve-out
financial information to derive any forecast about the future development of the LSI Business’ activities on
a separate basis.

Additional assumptions and estimates were made in preparing the carve-out financial statements, relating
in particular to LSI Business activities and net assets transferred and expenses allocated for administrative
services provided by Lonza Group that affect the amount and presentation of the LSI Business’ assets and
liabilities, of its income and expenses and of its contingent liabilities.

_Covid-19 impact on sales and operations_

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, Covid-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020,
the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities
around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19. The outbreak of Covid-19
and measures to prevent its spread including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged
closures of workplaces and other businesses and the related impact from closure of supply chains,
customers and associated reduction in consumer demand have had, and may continue to have, an impact
on the LSI Business’ performance.

In 2020, the LSI Business’ sales volumes, particularly in the Specialty Chemicals Solutions business, were
impacted by weaker end market demand, the closure of certain key customers and disruptions in certain
parts of the supply chain, including the temporary shutdown of certain LSI Business sites due to
government stay-at-home measures. Although the professional hygiene and home and personal care
businesses in the Microbial Control Solutions business experienced resilient levels of demand, many of the
LSI Business’ industrial markets experienced comparatively softer demand in areas such as Paints and
Coatings Material Protection and Crop Protection. As the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to
evolve the outbreak may continue to have unexpected positive and / or negative impacts on the LSI
Business performance.

_Subsequent events (note 24)_

As previously mentioned, the preparation of the carve-out financial statements is based on the extraction
approach, thus the financial information is extracted from the consolidated financial statements of Lonza
Group (refer to description above). The carve-out financial statements prepared under this approach
include information about subsequent events up to the date of issuance of the 2020 Lonza Group
consolidated financial statements, as well as through 31 March 2021, the date at which the historical
combined carve-out financial statements were approved to be issued.

**1.4 Changes in Accounting Standards**

The following new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period and did not
have any material effect on the carve-out financial statements:

- Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards

- Definition of a Business—Amendments to IFRS 3

- Definition of Material—Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8

- Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7

**1.5 Accounting Standards Issued, but not yet Effective**

The following revised standards have been issued but are not yet effective. They have not been applied
early in these carve-out financial statements. The below amendments are still being evaluated and the LSI
Business does not expect them to have a significant impact on the carve-out financial statements.

**1.6 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

_Scope and Principles of Combination_

The LSI Business is spread across multiple legal entities within Lonza Group. The identification of the LSI
Business is based on a modified legal entity view. To the extent possible, all activities followed the legal
entity structure of the LSI Business. Refer to note 23 for the list of the major components and scope of
combination.

The carve-out financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the historical consolidated financial
statements of the Lonza Group. All income, expenses, assets and liabilities economically attributable to the
LSI Business were included in the carve-out financial statements.

The LSI Business’ activities can be distinguished from other Lonza Group economic activities and are
under Lonza Group’s control. As they do not comprise an existing legal entity or Group, Lonza
management prepared the LSI Business’ carve-out financial statements on a combined basis.

_Investments_

The LSI Business’ interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates, as disclosed in
note 5. Associates are those entities in which the LSI Business has significant influence, but not control or
joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Associates are accounted for in the carve-out
financial statements using the equity method of accounting. They are recognized initially at cost including
transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the carve-out financial statements include the LSI
Business’ share of the profit and loss and other comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, until
the date on which significant influence ceases.

_Intercompany Transactions and Transactions with Related Parties_

Intercompany transactions and related assets and liabilities between LSI Business units included in the
carve-out financial statements have been eliminated. Transactions and balance sheet items with other
Lonza Group business units previously considered as intercompany transactions in the historical Lonza
Group reporting have been treated and disclosed as transactions with related parties in these carve out
financial statements. Such related party transactions are expected to be settled upon closing of the
divestiture of the LSI Business, unless there are separate contractual arrangements.

_Revenue Recognition_

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer und excludes
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenues are recognized when a customer obtains control of
a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.

F-18


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

Product sales are recognized when control of the products has been transferred, i.e. when the products are
delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the sales channel and pricing of the
products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products.
Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and
loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in
accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the LSI Business has
objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. Revenues from providing services are
recognized in the accounting period in which these services are rendered. For most services, revenue
recognition over time is appropriate. This is done with reference to output (i.e. analysis delivered) to
measure the amount of revenue to be recognized. Revenue recognition over time is not applied for
customer service contracts where the consideration depends on a defined outcome or result, and its
achievement cannot be estimated. In this case, revenues are only recognized at the point in time when the
service has been completed and accepted by the customer.

_Other Operating Income and Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating income and other operating expenses include items not assignable to other functions of
the carve-out income statement. They mainly include gains and losses from the disposal of intangible
assets, property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, income and expenses from the release
and recognition of provisions, income and expenses related to restructuring, gains and losses from
currency-related operating derivative instruments, as well as operating exchange rate gains and losses.

_Net Financial Result_

Net financial result comprises interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest
method, the interest expenses on the net defined-benefit pension liability, the finance charge for finance
leases, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on financial assets and liabilities, gains and losses on
hedging instruments that are recognized in the income statement and gains and losses on sale of financial
assets. Interest income and expenses are recognized in the income statement as they accrue, taking into
account the effective yield of the asset or liability or an applicable floating rate. Interest income and
expenses include the amortization of any discount or premium or other differences between the initial
carrying amount of an interest-bearing instrument and its amount at maturity calculated on an effective
interest rate basis.

_Foreign Currencies_

Items included in the carve-out financial statements of each LSI Business component are measured using
the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (‘‘functional currency’’). The
carve-out financial statements are presented in Swiss francs, which is the presentation currency of the LSI
Business. For combination purposes the balance sheet of all LSI Business components reporting in foreign
currencies is translated to CHF with the exchange rate of the balance sheet date. Income, expenses and
cash flows of the foreign LSI Business components are translated into CHF using the monthly average
exchange rates during the year. Exchange rate differences arising from the different exchange rates applied
in balance sheets and income statements are recognized in other comprehensive income. In the individual
components’ financial statements, transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange
rate applicable at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the balance sheet date are remeasured at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Exchange rate differences arising from these remeasurements are recognized in the income statement.

_Hedge Accounting_

The LSI Business uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate and
commodity price risks. The instruments used may include, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps, forward
exchange contracts, FX swaps and options. The LSI Business generally limits the use of hedge accounting
to certain significant transactions. At inception of designated hedging relationships, the LSI Business
documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The LSI Business also
documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including

F-19


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each
other.

**_Cash flow hedge—This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular_**
risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction and could
affect net income. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is
included in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in cost of goods sold
(instruments to manage the commodity price exposure), other operating income and expenses
(instruments to manage the foreign currency exposure related to sales or purchases) or financial income
and expenses (foreign currency exposure related to debt repayment or interest exposure on the LSI
Business’ debt). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment
or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the
cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other
comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item at the date of
recognition. For all other cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in cost of goods sold,
other operational income and expenses or other financial income and expenses (based on the principles
explained above) when the forecasted transaction affects net income.

**_Fair value hedge—This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or_**
an unrecognized firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment,
that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect net income. The hedging instrument is recorded at
fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair
value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are reported in cost of goods sold
(instruments to manage the commodity price exposure), other operating income and expenses
(instruments to manage the foreign currency exposure related to sales or purchases) or financial income
and expenses (foreign currency exposure related to debt repayment or interest exposure on the LSI
Business’ debt).

_Property, Plant and Equipment_

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses. The assets are depreciated on a component basis over their estimated useful lives,
which vary from 10 to 50 years for buildings and structures, and 5 to 16 years for production facilities,
machinery, plant, equipment and vehicles. Fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives. Subsequent expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of
property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, including major inspection and overhaul
expenditure, is capitalized. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future
economic benefits embodied in the item of property, plant and equipment. Borrowing costs incurred with
respect to qualifying assets are capitalized and included in the carrying value of the assets. All other
expenditure is recognized in the income statement as an expense as incurred. The residual values and the
useful life of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each
balance sheet date.

_Leases_

The LSI Business assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration.

The LSI Business applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The LSI Business recognizes lease liabilities to make lease
payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and
adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of
lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, restoration costs and lease payments made at or
before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. If

F-20


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

ownership of the leased asset transfers to the LSI Business at the end of the lease term or the cost of the
right-of-use asset reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated
useful life of the asset.

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, considering fixed
payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that are based on an index or a
rate, amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a
purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option, less any lease incentives
receivable.

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the
LSI Business. These terms are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. In
determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or
periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to
be extended (or not terminated). The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable
only by the LSI Business and not by the respective lessor. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event
or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control
of the lessee.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the LSI Business uses its incremental borrowing rate at
the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The
incremental borrowing rate is derived from market information, the weighted average duration of the lease
and the underlying specifics of the leased asset. After the commencement date, the amount of lease
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

The LSI Business applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a
purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of other
movables that are considered to be of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low
value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

In some circumstances, the LSI Business could act as a lessor. In case of a sublease, the LSI Business
would account for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease will be classified
as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The LSI Business allocates the consideration
in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However,
for leases of machinery, and for which the LSI Business is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and
non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component.

_Intangible Assets_

Purchased intangible assets with a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at
their fair value. Intangibles include software, licenses, patents, trademarks and similar rights granted by
third parties, capitalized product development costs and capitalized computer software development costs.
Costs associated with internally developed or maintained computer software programs are recognized as
an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the LSI Business, and that will probably generate future economic benefits
exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognized as intangible assets. Those direct costs include the
software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Intangible assets
are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which is the lower of the
legal duration and the economic useful life. Useful lives vary from 3 to 5 years for software, 5 to 35 years
for patents, trademarks and similar rights and 4 to 16 years for development costs. Trademarks acquired
through the Arch Chemicals business combination have an indefinite useful life. The LSI Business
considers that these trademarks have an indefinite useful life as they are well established in the respective
markets and have a history of strong performance. The LSI Business intends and has the ability to
maintain these trademarks for the foreseeable future.

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill from business combinations is recognized as the surplus of the consideration transferred over the
acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the acquired net assets at cost on the acquisition date and
corresponds to the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities identified in the purchase price allocation. Goodwill is capitalized and included in
intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment. After initial recognition
goodwill is recognized at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over
the LSI Business’ share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within
investments in associates.

_Inventories_

Inventories are reported at the lower of cost (purchase price or production cost) or market value (net
realizable value). In determining net realizable value, any costs of completion and selling costs are
deducted from the realizable value. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average
method. An allocation of production overheads is included in the valuation of inventories. Costs include all
expenditures related directly to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred
in the LSI Business’ contract activities based on normal operating capacity. Adjustments are made for
inventories with a lower market value or which are slow moving. Unsalable inventory is fully written off.

_Receivables_

Receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, volume
rebates and similar allowances. A receivable represents a right to consideration that is unconditional and
excludes contract assets. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for expected credit losses over the
term of the receivables. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer
balances and specific credit circumstances. Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognized within
the cost of goods sold. Receivables are written off (either partly or in full) when there is no reasonable
expectation of recovery.

For trade receivables, the LSI Business applies the simplified approach prescribed by IFRS 9, which
requires / permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision from initial recognition of the receivables.
The LSI Business measures an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the credit losses expected over the
lifetime of the trade receivables.

_Financial Instruments_

The LSI Business has classified its financial assets in the following measurement categories, which are
disclosed in note 22: amortized costs or fair value through profit or loss.

At initial recognition, the LSI Business measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a
financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or
loss are expensed in profit or loss.

**_Amortized cost—Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent_**
solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost, less provision for impairment.
Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using the effective interest
rate method. The LSI Business derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows
from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in
which substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest
in such transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the LSI Business is recognized as a
separate asset or liability. Assets at amortized cost are mainly comprised of accounts receivable, cash and
cash equivalents and loans and advances.

**_Fair value through profit or loss—hedging instruments—These are derivative financial instruments that are_**
used to manage the exposures to foreign currency, interest rates and commodity prices. These instruments

F-22


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as
qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as cost of goods sold
(instruments to manage the commodity price exposure), other operating income and expenses
(instruments to manage the foreign currency exposure related to sales or purchases) or financial income
and expenses (foreign currency exposure related to debt repayment or interest exposure on the LSI
Business’ debt).

The fair value of derivatives (forward exchange contract, FX swaps, commodity swaps and interest rate
swaps) is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current
forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a credit adjusted risk-free rate. Current
forward prices are provided by banks or other financial service providers.

**_Debt instruments—These are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received net of transaction costs._**
They are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the net proceeds and the
redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the debt instrument using the
effective interest method.

_Cash and Cash Equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, in postal and bank accounts, as well as short-term deposits
and highly liquid funds that have an original maturity of less than three months.

_Impairment_

Assets that are subject to amortization and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an
indication that the assets may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

_Deferred Taxes_

Tax expense or income is calculated using the balance-sheet liability method. Deferred taxes are provided
wherever temporary differences exist between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in
the carve-out financial statements.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and, for deferred tax assets, operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates in the
respective jurisdictions in which LSI Business operates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the
recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For transactions and other events recognized in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity attributable to Lonza Group, any related tax effect is
recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity attributable to Lonza Group.

_Employee Benefits_

Employee-benefit liabilities as stated in the carve-out balance sheet include obligations from definedbenefit pension plans, multi-employers pension plans, other post-employment benefits (medical plans) as
well as other long-term employee-related liabilities.

_Defined-Benefit Plans (Pension and Medical Plans)_

The LSI Business’ net obligation in respect of defined-benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan
by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods,
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined-benefit

F-23


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

obligations is performed annually by a qualified external actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a potential asset for the LSI Business, the recognized asset is limited to the
present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is
given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Remeasurements of the defined-benefit liability,
which comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect
of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income.

The LSI Business determines the net interest expense on the net defined-benefit liabilities for the period
by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined-benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual
period to the net defined-benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined-benefit
liability during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other
expenses related to defined-benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss. While the net interest expense is
disclosed within financial expenses, the other expenses related to defined-benefit plans are allocated to the
different functions of the operating activities. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that related to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is
recognized immediately in profit or loss. The LSI Business recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of
a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

_Provisions_

A provision is recognized in the carve-out balance sheet when (i) the LSI Business has a legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be
made. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the liability. A provision for restructuring is recognized when the LSI Business has approved a detailed and
formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly. Future
operating costs are not provided for.

Provisions for environmental liabilities are made when there is a legal or constructive obligation for the
LSI Business that will result in an outflow of economic resources. Provisions are made for remedial work
where there is an obligation to remedy environmental damage, as well as for containment work where
required by environmental regulations.

_Share-Based Compensation_

Certain employees of the LSI Business participate in the share-based payment plans (LTIP) provided by
the Lonza Group. These plans qualify as equity-settled share-based payment plans and are settled in shares
of Lonza Group Ltd by Lonza Group Ltd.

The share-based payments are measured at fair value on the grant date. When measuring these
transactions, only those conditions which are linked to the price of Lonza’s shares (market conditions) are
taken into account, along with any non-vesting conditions.

The LSI Business estimates the number of Lonza shares which are expected to vest. Expense adjustments
due to changes in expectations regarding the number of Lonza shares expected to vest are recognized in
personnel costs for the relevant reporting period. The expense is recognized over the vesting period as part
of personnel expense and an increase in equity attributable to the Lonza Group for the best estimate of the
number of shares LSI Business expects to vest. Adjustments to these expectations are immediately
recognized in profit or loss.

If the arrangements are modified during the life of an equity-settled share-based payment plan, any
incremental fair value is recognized over the remaining vesting period. If the plan is cancelled, the rights
are assumed to be exercised on the date of cancellation and the expense is recognized immediately in
profit or loss. If the cancelled plan is replaced by a new share-based payment plan identified as a
replacement award, the expense is recognized in the same way as for modifications.

**1.7 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

_Use of Estimates_

The estimates in accordance with the basis of preparation made in these carve-out financial statements are
consistent with the estimates made at the same date in accordance with the reporting requirements under
IFRS as part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Lonza Group, unless there is
objective evidence that those estimates are not in accordance with IFRS on a carve-out basis. The areas
involving a high degree of judgment, and where estimates and assumptions are significant to the carve-out
financial statements, are disclosed.

The preparation of the carve-out financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with IFRS
requires management of the LSI Business to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, income and expenses. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Estimates are used in impairment tests, accounting for allowances for doubtful receivables,
inventory obsolescence, depreciation, pension assets and liabilities, income taxes, provisions, contingencies,
and carve-out adjustments. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of
revisions are reflected in the carve-out financial statements in the period in which they are determined to
be necessary. The key assumptions about the future key sources of estimation uncertainty that entail a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year are described below.

_Impairment Test of Property, Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets and Goodwill_

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment. To assess
if any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its possible disposal. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted
future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or
closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or
lower-than-anticipated sales of products with capitalized rights could result in shortened useful lives or
impairment.

The impairment analysis performed in 2019 was most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted
cash flow model, as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for calculation
purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different
cash-generating units are further explained in note 3. In 2020, as a result of the planned divestiture of the
LSI Business, no separate value in use calculation was performed. Instead, the ‘fair value less costs of
disposal’ was calculated in order to identify any indication of impairment.

_Pensions_

Many of the LSI Business’ employees participate in post-employment plans. The calculations of the
recognized assets and liabilities from such plans are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. In
particular, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is influenced by assumptions on discount
rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension liabilities and assumptions on future increases in
salaries and benefits.

Furthermore, the LSI Business’ independent external actuaries use statistically based assumptions,
covering areas such as future withdrawals of participants from the plan and estimates of life expectancy.
The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and
economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter lifespans of participants and
other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could affect the fair value of assets or
liabilities recognized in the balance sheet in future periods.

_Income Taxes_

Significant estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income
taxes. Certain of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations.
Management of the LSI Business believes that the estimates are reasonable and that the recognized
liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external factors may have

F-25


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

favorable or unfavorable effects on the actual amounts of estimated income tax assets and liabilities. These
factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing
interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Such
changes that arise could affect the assets and liabilities recognized in the carve-out balance sheet in future
periods.

_Environmental Provisions_

The LSI Business is exposed to environmental liabilities and risks relating to its operations, principally in
respect of provisions for remediation costs. Provisions for non-recurring remediation costs are made when
there is a legal or constructive obligation and the cost can be reliably estimated. It is difficult to estimate
any future action required by the LSI Business to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal
or release of chemical substances by the LSI Business or other parties, and the associated costs, pursuant
to environmental laws and regulations. The material components of the environmental provisions consist
of costs to clean and refurbish contaminated sites and to treat and contain contamination at sites. The LSI
Business’ future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties that include, but are not
limited to, the method and extent of remediation and the responsibility attributable to the LSI Business at
the remediation sites, relative to that attributable to other parties. The LSI Business permanently monitors
the various sites identified as at risk for environmental exposures. The LSI Business believes that its
provisions are adequate, based upon currently available information; however, given the inherent
difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be
incurred beyond the amounts provided. Due to the uncertainty both of the amount and timing of future
expenses, the provisions provided for environmental remediation costs could be affected in future periods.

_Carve-out Adjustments_

The carve-out financial statements include the allocations of revenue, income, expenses, assets, liabilities
and cash flows that are described in note 1, Basis of Preparation, which are based on management
judgment, assumptions and estimates. Carve-out adjustments that involve higher degree of judgment,
assumptions and estimates in these carve-out financial statements are related to shared assets and
liabilities, allocation of goodwill, Lonza Group cost allocations, taxes and equity attributable to Lonza
Group. See a description of the allocation approach in the section Basis of Preparation above.

**1.8 Critical Accounting Judgments in Applying the LSI Business’ Accounting Policies**

In the process of applying the LSI Business’ accounting policies, management has made the following
judgments that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the carve-out financial
statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are disclosed above).

_Revenue Recognition_

The LSI Business has recognized revenues for sales of goods during the year to customers who have the
right to rescind the sale if the goods do not meet the agreed quality. The LSI Business believes that, based
on past experience with similar transactions, the quality delivered will be accepted. Therefore, it is
appropriate to recognize revenue on these transactions during the respective period. Revenues are
recognized only when, according to management’s judgment, performance obligations are satisfied, control
over the assets have been transferred to the customer and no future performance obligation exists. For
certain transactions, recognition of revenues is based on the performance of the conditions agreed in
particular contracts, the verification of which requires evaluation and judgments by management.

_Intangible Assets_

The LSI Business considers the trademarks acquired in 2011 through the Arch Chemicals business
combination to have an indefinite useful life, as they are well established in the respective markets and
have a history of strong performance. The LSI Business intends and has the ability to maintain these
trademarks for the foreseeable future. The assumption of an indefinite useful life is reassessed whenever
there is an indication that a trademark may have a definite useful life. In addition, intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis.

Intangible assets comprise software, licenses, patents, trademarks and similar rights granted by third
parties, capitalized product development costs and capitalized computer software development costs. The
amortization of these assets is included within ‘‘Administration and general overheads’’ on the carve-out
income statement.

The trademarks acquired through the Lonza Group acquisition of Arch Chemicals (2011) are considered
to have indefinite useful lives. As a result, these intangible assets, with a carrying amount of
CHF 82 million as of 31 December 2020 (2019: CHF 89 million), are not systematically amortized.

Development costs as of 31 December 2020 predominantly include technologies acquired with the Arch
Chemical acquisition of CHF 22 million (2019: CHF 28 million).

**3.2 Impairment Tests for Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives**

The LSI Business units are the cash-generating units identified and subject to the impairment testing of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

The following cash-generating units maintain carrying amounts of goodwill as presented below (at
year-end exchange rates):

**Note 3—Intangible Assets and Goodwill (Continued)**

The following cash-generating units maintain carrying amounts of intangible assets (other than goodwill)
with indefinite useful lives as presented below (at year-end exchange rates):

**million CHF** **2020** **2019**

Specialty Ingredients (representing a group of cash-generating units) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 82 89

**Total carrying amounts of intangible assets with indefinite useful life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **82** **89**

The recoverable amount of the above cash-generating units at 31 December 2020 is based on its ‘‘fair value
less costs of disposal’’ determined in reference to the observable price stipulated in the definitive
agreement for the sale of the LSI Business by Lonza Group. The definitive agreement is described in
further detail in note 24. The determination of the fair value less cost of disposal used a Level 2 valuation
technique. The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets are expected to be covered by the
expected proceeds from the sale of the LSI Business. For 2019, the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating units was based on the value-in-use calculation.

Management concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill or intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives in any of the cash-generating units (or group of cash-generating units) for
the periods presented.

In 2020, an impairment loss of CHF 14 million (2019: CHF 13 million), mainly related to production
facilities in Kourim (Czech Republic) and buildings and structures in Visp (Switzerland), was recognized.
This impairment is resultant from a reduction in future cash flow projections related to the facilities. In
2020, costs of CHF 13 million (2019: 10 million) associated with asset impairment are reflected within
‘‘Cost of Goods sold’’ on the carve-out income statement while CHF 1 million (2019: 2 million) is reflected
separately in ‘‘Other operating expenses’’ on the carve-out income statement.

Commitments for capital expenditure in property, plant and equipment amounted to CHF 20 million at
year-end 2020 (2019: CHF 37 million).

(1) Included in cost of goods sold and administration and general overheads

(2) Included in financial expenses

During the year ended 31 December 2020, CHF 22 million (2019: CHF 14 million) was recognized as an
expense in the carve-out income statement in respect of leases that do not require the capitalization of a
RoU asset and lease liability.

On 1 November 2020, the LSI Business entered into supply and tolling agreements with Lonza Group
related to products that are produced by LPBN on behalf of LSI at the Group’s Nansha site in China. The
supply and tolling agreements are treated as a lease contract under IFRS 16. All payments under the
supply and tolling agreements are considered as variable lease payments as they are considered to be
closely linked to quantities ordered and/or LSI’s portion of utilization of the production capacity which is
variable throughout the period of the lease. Such variability is resolved only once binding orders are
placed. For confirmed orders, the full amount due is payable and there is therefore no possibility of
cancellation. As a result, no lease liability and related right-of-use asset has been recognized because lease
payments are considered either variable or subject to the short-term lease recognition exemption
(i.e., lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date). The variable lease payments or lease
payments related to short-term leases under the aforementioned contracts are included entirely in cost of
goods sold in the LSI income statement. The supply and tolling agreements do not include purchase
commitments and do not stipulate minimum order quantities, so it is not possible to estimate the future
anticipated volume of purchases under the contract for future periods. The term of such contracts varies
between 11 months and 5 years, with contracts allowing the possibility to extend for a further 3 months or
5 years at the same conditions. Such extension options have been included so as to maximize operational
flexibility, and are exercisable only by LSI. At present, it is not reasonably certain that such extensions will
be exercised.

**4.3 Adoption of IFRS 16 Leases**

IFRS 16 Leases introduced a single, on balance sheet accounting model for lessees. As a result, the LSI
Business, as a lessee, has recognized right-of-use assets representing its right to use the underlying assets
and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments. Lessor accounting remains similar
to previous accounting policies.

The LSI Business initially adopted IFRS 16 Leases from 1 January 2019 and applied the modified
retrospective method, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in retained
earnings at 1 January 2019. Consequently, comparative 2018 information was not restated. The LSI
Business elected to use the transition practical expedient allowing the standard to be applied only to
contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 at the date of initial
application.

_Nature of Lease Contracts_

The LSI Business has lease contracts for various items of buildings, machinery, vehicles and other
equipment. Before the adoption of IFRS 16, the LSI Business classified each of its leases (as lessee) at the
inception date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease was classified as a finance lease if it
substantially transferred all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the LSI
Business; otherwise it was classified as an operating lease. Finance leases were capitalized at the

F-32


-----

**Note 4—Property, Plant and Equipment (Continued)**

commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments.

Lease payments were apportioned between interest (recognized as in the financial result) and reduction of
the lease liability. In an operating lease, the leased property was not capitalized and the lease payments
were recognized as rent expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the LSI Business applied a single recognition and measurement approach for
all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

_Summary of Impacts on LSI Business’ Financial Statements_

At transition, for leases classified as operating leases under IAS17, lease liabilities were measured at the
present value of remaining lease payments, discounted at the LSI Business’ incremental borrowing rate for
each asset class as at 1 January 2019. Right-of-use assets were measured at an amount equal to the lease
liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments.

The LSI Business applied the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously
classified as operating leases under IAS 17 (in addition to the general practical expedients described in the
chapter ‘‘Leases’’ below):

- Exemption not to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases for which the lease term ends
within 12 months of the date of initial application

- Exemption not to recognize lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (‘‘low value
assets’’)

- Exclusion of initial direct costs when measuring the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application

For the lease liabilities for leases that were previously classified as operating leases, the LSI Business
discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate on 1 January 2019. The weighted-average
rate applied is 3.54%.

_Impact for the Year of Adoption_

Lease payments (equal to operating lease payments in the income statement under IAS 17) amounted to
CHF 5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Consequently, applying IFRS 16 had a favorable
impact of less than CHF 1 million on the LSI Business’ result from operating activities in 2019.

In general, the LSI Business does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables but uses
credit insurance for certain country risks where appropriate.

**7.1 Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs**

In 2019 Lonza Group’s centralized treasury department maintained a securitization program for its US
Business, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and a factoring program with ING Bank, which the LSI Business
was part of. In September 2020, Lonza Group did not renew the securitization program with Wells Fargo
Bank and the contract was terminated. The ING factoring program (off balance sheet under IFRS) was
originally entered into by Lonza Group’s centralized treasury department to sell a portfolio of certain
trade receivables starting in 2013 and remains in effect as of 31 December 2020.

Under the Wells Fargo Bank program, as of 31 December 2019, the LSI Business sold trade receivables to
Capsugel Funding LLC, a Lonza Group entity outside of the LSI carve-out perimeter, amounting to
CHF 6 million. As the sale of these receivables to Capsugel does not meet the criteria for de-recognition,
the receivables and a corresponding liability are recorded in the LSI financial statements (see note 12).

As of 31 December 2020, the LSI Business did not have any sold trade receivables to Capsugel
Funding LLC as the corresponding securitization program was terminated in September 2020.

Generally current and deferred income taxes are recognized by each component of the LSI Business,
regardless of having a legal liability for settlement or recovery of tax.

Refer to note 1 for significant considerations in connection with the recognition of income taxes in these
carve-out financial statements.

As the LSI Business operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in several different tax
jurisdictions. From 1 January 2020, the LSI Business applies, as the carve-out tax rate, the ordinary tax rate
of Lonza Group’s headquarters in the Canton of Basel in Switzerland (13%). Before 2020, and prior to the
Swiss Tax Reform, the LSI Business applied the ordinary tax rate of its the operating entity in the Canton
of Valais of 21.6% as the carve-out tax rate. The LSI Business’ effective tax rate for 2020 is 25.8% (2019:
26.1%).

The enactment of the Valais tax reform reduced the Valais income tax rate to 20.1% (for 2020), 18.6% (for
2021) and 17% (for the years 2022 and following). As a result of these tax rate reductions, the LSI Business
recognized corresponding adjustments to its deferred tax liabilities resulting in a net income tax benefit of
CHF 10 million during 2020, which were partially offset by CHF 1 million of other tax rate changes
primarily in the United Kingdom.

In addition to the unrecognized tax losses shown in the above table, the LSI Business has additional
unrecognized tax losses for US state tax purposes in the amount of CHF 177 million at 31 December 2020
(2019: CHF 230 million). These losses expire in more than 5 years.

In assessing whether it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilize these tax losses
carry- forwards, management considers whether such benefits are recoverable on the basis of the current
situation of the company and the future economic benefits outlined in specific business plans for each
relevant subsidiary.

Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be
payable on the remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded
as permanently reinvested. The total unremitted earnings of the LSI Business that would be subject to
withholding tax or other taxes upon remittance, but which are regarded as permanently reinvested, were
CHF 126 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: CHF 379 million). The decrease is mainly due to the fact
that substantial dividends were distributed during 2020.

**19.1 Defined-Benefit Pension Plans**

The LSI Business operates defined-benefit pension plans in various countries, with the major plans located
in Switzerland, the UK and the United States (as described below). For accounting purposes, these plans
are considered as defined-benefit plans.

_Pension Plan in Switzerland_

In 2020, a newly established LSI legal entity, Lonza Solutions AG, in Switzerland entered into an affiliation
agreement with Lonza Group’s Swiss pension fund. As a result, a corresponding defined benefit obligation
of CHF 321 million and plan assets of CHF 266 million for the LSI Business were recognized for the year
ended 31 December 2020. These balances are aligned with independent actuarial valuations and follow the
requirements of IAS 19 and were included in the Lonza Group consolidated financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2020

Swiss-based LSI employees were first transferred to Lonza Solutions AG on 1 June 2020 (i.e. the starting
date of the affiliation agreement), yet still remained part of the existing Lonza pension plan at that date.

Following the divestiture of the LSI Business by Lonza Group, a partial liquidation of pension funds is
expected. Swiss-based LSI employees which are over the age of 59 (female) or 60 (male) as of 1 January
2020 shall continue to remain within the existing Lonza pension plan. No retirees shall be allocated to any
new pension plan which is established by any new buyers (or owners) of the LSI Business.

The affiliation agreement may only be terminated with at least a 6-month notice period prior to the end of
any financial year. Any new buyers (or owners) of the LSI Business must have established a pension plan
prior to termination of the affiliation agreement.

Assets and liabilities shall transfer to the new pension plan of the buyers (or owners) of the LSI Business
according to the terms of the partial liquidation agreement. The partial liquidation process is the
responsibility of the Board of Trustees of the Lonza pension plan. Transfers of pension assets and liabilities
shall be conducted in line with Swiss legislation requirements and must be approved by the Swiss pension
regulator.

The LSI Business’s Swiss pension plan is governed by the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement,
Survivors and Disability Pension Plans (BVG), and is funded through a legally separate trusteeadministered pension fund (Pensionskasse der Lonza). The Board of Trustees is responsible for the
investment of the assets, which cannot revert to the LSI Business. The cash funding of these plans, which
may from time to time involve special payments, is designed to ensure that present and future
contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.

The plan contains a cash balance benefit formula, accounted for as a defined-benefit plan. Employer and
employee contributions are defined in the pension fund rules in terms of an age-related sliding scale of
percentages of pay. Under Swiss law, the company guarantees the vested benefit amount as confirmed
annually to members. Interest may be added to member balances at the discretion of the Board of
Trustees. The risks linked to retirement benefits (disability and death) have been reinsured until
31 December 2020. The investment risk is not reinsured.

Retirement benefits are based on the accumulated retirement capital (made up of yearly contributions and
the interest thereon), which can either be drawn as a life-long annuity or as a lump-sum payment or a
combination of both. The Board of Trustees may adjust the annuity at its discretion subject to the plan’s
funded status including sufficient free funds as determined according to Swiss statutory valuation rules.
Retirement benefits and related plan assets of plan participants with a retirement date on or before
31 December 2007 were transferred to an insurance company. The insurance company guarantees these
retirement benefits and bears the investment, death and disability risks.

_Pension Plan in the UK_

The LSI Business operates the Hickson UK Group Pension Scheme. This plan is closed to new entrants. In
addition, the scheme is registered under UK legislation, is contracted out of the State Second Pension and
is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation. The plan is managed by
corporate trustee bodies, which oversee investment strategy and general regulatory compliance. The

**Note 19—Employee Benefit Liabilities (Continued)**

Hickson UK Group Pension Scheme is the defined-benefit pension plan of the UK Arch Chemicals
business. Pensions are linked to final salaries and service, and statutory inflation increases apply, except
where contractually different. Ongoing contributions are sufficient to fund current accrual rates, and a
deficit recovery plan has been in place for a number of years to recover any shortfall in funding.

_Pension Plans in the United States_

The LSI Business currently sponsors three qualified defined-benefit pension plans in the United States. All
of the defined-benefit pension plans are fully frozen with respect to future benefit accruals (with the
exception of a small group of participants). All eligible U.S. employees currently participate in a definedcontribution retirement plan. Pension benefits for the majority of U.S. pension plan participants are
generally based on final average pay and credited service as of the date of termination or as of the date
benefit accruals were frozen (if earlier) and are payable as a lifetime pension. Participants in the Cash
Balance formula under the Pension Plan of Arch Chemicals are covered under an account-based formula
that is credited each year with interest based on the yield on ten-year U.S. Treasury securities. Participants
in these plans may commence benefit payments upon attainment of normal retirement age or, if
applicable, as of an early retirement age (usually age 55) provided the criteria for early retirement have
been met as of the participant’s termination of employment with the Company. Participants in the Cash
Balance plan may elect to commence benefits upon termination of employment either in a single lump sum
or as a lifetime annuity, or they may defer payment to a later date.

Pension benefit payments from the qualified pension plans are paid from a trustee-administered fund. The
qualified defined-benefit plans, whose assets are held in a master trust, are subject to minimum funding
requirements and are subject to further regulation under the Internal Revenue Code and the Employees
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Responsibility for governance of these qualified plans
lies with a committee of pension plan fiduciaries appointed by Lonza Group. Actuarial valuations are
completed each year for each plan to determine the contribution requirement. The minimum annual
contribution for each plan is equal to the present value of benefits accrued each year (if any), plus expected
administrative expenses of the plan to be paid from the trust, plus a rolling amortization of any prior
underfunding. The plan sponsor may elect to contribute more than the minimum, in which case the excess
amounts may under certain circumstances be used to offset future funding requirements.

pension fund during the current financial year. For this reason, no comparatives are presented for the Swiss territory.

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published
statistics and experience in each territory. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in
years for a pensioner retiring at age 65:

(1) The newly established LSI legal entity, Lonza Solutions AG, entered into an affiliation agreement with Lonza Group’s Swiss
pension fund during the current financial year. For this reason, no comparatives are presented for the Swiss territory.

The sensitivity of the defined-benefit obligation to changes in the relevant actuarial assumptions is:

**2019**
**2020** **(Revised)**
**Change in** **Change in**
**million CHF** **assumption** **Increase** **Decrease** **assumption** **Increase** **Decrease**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.25% (53) 56 0.25% (37) 41

Life expectancy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 year 55 (55) 1 year 44 (42)

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while keeping all other assumptions
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined-benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the
same method (present value of the defined-benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability
recognized within the balance sheet.

The LSI Business post-employment medical benefit plans are not funded and are provided under definedbenefit plans. They consist of post-retirement healthcare benefits in the United States, such as drug
coverage and other medical benefits, as well as limited death benefits.

The post-retirement healthcare plans have not been open to new members since 2011 and grandfathered
participants must meet specific age / service requirements to participate.

pension plans.

**Note 20—Share-Based Payments**

**20.1 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)**

_History and Participation_

The LTIP is an equity-based plan for the Lonza Group Executive Committee and a segment of key
employees. Certain LSI Business employees participate in the LTIP.

_Objective_

The LTIP program has been designed to align the interests of participants with those of Lonza Group’s
shareholders and to serve as a retention tool. LTIP participants are eligible to receive a number of Lonza
shares at the end of the vesting period, provided that certain performance conditions are met at the end of
the three-year performance period.

_Recognition in the carve-out financial statements_

The LSI Business’ carve-out financial statements include the share-based payment-related costs
attributable to the LSI employees entitled to the Lonza Group LTIP. These LSI Business related equitysettled share-based payment costs had an impact on the 2020 ‘‘Profit before income taxes’’ amounting
CHF 6 million (2019: 6 CHF million).

**Note 21—Related Parties**

Related parties include pension and other post-retirement funds as well as all subsidiaries, associates and
joint ventures of the Lonza Group. The key management personnel of Lonza Group consisting of the
Board of Directors and the members of the Executive Committee are considered key management of the
LSI Business and are therefore classified as related parties. Transactions with Lonza Group and key
management personnel information are disclosed in this related party note based on the allocation
methodology applied, in the preparation of these carve-out financial statements (refer to note 1).

_Sales to Lonza Group and Purchases from Lonza Group_

Certain supply, tolling and delivery agreements exist between the LSI Business and Lonza Group. The LSI
Business and the Lonza Group deliver mainly raw materials and intermediates/semi-finished products to
each other on a case by case basis. In addition, finished products were purchased by the LSI Business from
Lonza Group during the year via supply and tolling agreements which contain a lease (refer to note 4). The
cost of such goods are based on agreed unit or tolling costs that have been agreed between the parties also
in light of the planned disposal of the LSI Business, and are therefore based on conditions that are
considered normal commercial terms and conditions for such contracts, and reflect pricing that would be
available to third parties.

_Legal entity clearing account_

A clearing account has historically been used for transactions within Lonza Group. It contains balancing
entries for cost allocations and transactions within a legal entity. Furthermore, the account is used for cash

**Note 21—Related Parties (Continued)**

collections and cash disbursement transactions. If cash management services are provided from the LSI
Business for non-LSI Businesses, the received cash is allocated to the non-LSI Business in the clearing
account (and vice versa). Thus, at Lonza Group consolidation level, the balance of this account is zero.

Due to the nature of the transactions in the clearing account between the LSI Business and its related
parties (Lonza Group components), the balance of the account is not zero for the LSI Business in these
carve-out financial statements. For the preparation of the carve-out financial statements, the balance of
this account is recorded in equity attributable to Lonza Group at each balance sheet date. The balance is
considered as equity and represents a net capital distribution to Lonza Group amounting to
CHF 542 million (2019: CHF 522 million).

**21.2 Remuneration of Key Management of Lonza Group Allocated to the LSI Business**

In the periods presented, the LSI Business was not a legal group for consolidated reporting statement
purposes in accordance with IFRS 10 (see section ‘‘Reporting Entity’’ above).

The LSI Business was for all financial statement periods presented herein controlled by Lonza Group.
Therefore, the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of Lonza Group Ltd are deemed key
management. For information related to Lonza Group’s Board of Directors and Executive Committee
refer to Lonza Group’s publicly available annual reports.

**Note 22—Financial Risk Management**

**22.1 Overall Risk Management Policy**

The LSI Business is exposed in particular to credit and liquidity risk as well as to risks from movements in
foreign currency exchange rates and market prices that affect its assets, liabilities, and forecasted
transactions. These risks have historically been managed at the Lonza Group level. Lonza’s overall risk
management policy aims to limit these risks through operational and finance activities.

The LSI Business’ financing and financial risk management activities are centralized into Lonza Group
treasury, which manages financial exposures of the Lonza Group on account of changes in currency risks
and credit risks in a manner that is consistent with underlying business risks. In addition, capital
management of the LSI Business has also been primarily exercised and monitored at the Lonza Group
level.

**22.2 Credit Risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the LSI Business if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and mainly arises from the LSI Business’ receivables
from customers.

_Accounts Receivable_

The LSI Business’ exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. The Lonza Group Treasury function assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into
account its financial position, past experience and other factors. In monitoring customer credit risk,
customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry,
and existence of previous financial difficulties.

Purchase limits are established for each customer, which are reviewed regularly. For customers domiciled
in specific countries with high risk, the LSI Business has credit risk insurance covering the maximum

F-49


-----

**Note 22—Financial Risk Management (Continued)**

exposure. The maximum credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the respective assets. There are no
commitments that could increase this exposure to more than the carrying amounts. In general, the LSI
Business does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables but uses credit insurance for
country risk where appropriate.

The LSI Business has a history of low credit losses on accounts receivable. Credit losses that occurred in
the past were primarily related to very few single customers. Furthermore, none of the LSI Business’
operations had a heightened exposure to credit losses in the past and based on the LSI Business’ best
estimate, this is not expected to change in the foreseeable future.

Consequently, the allowance for credit losses (as disclosed in note 7) represents primarily the credit risk of
specific customers.

_Financial Instruments and Cash Deposits_

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by Lonza Group’s treasury
department. Counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly. The carrying amount of financial assets
represents the maximum credit exposure.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**Total financial assets at amortized cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **541** **613**

**22.3 Liquidity Risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the LSI Business will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The LSI Business’ approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the LSI Business’ reputation. Group Treasury maintains flexibility
in funding also using bilateral and syndicated credit lines.

The table below analyzes the LSI Business’ financial liabilities and derivative financial liabilities in relevant
maturity groupings, based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity
date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, including interest
payments. Balances due within 12 months are equal to their carrying balances, as the impact of discounting
is not significant.

**22.4 Market Risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the LSI Business’ income or the value of its
holdings of financial instruments. The LSI Business is exposed to market risk from changes in currency
exchange and interest rates and commodities. The objective of market risk management is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return on risk. Lonza
Group has established a treasury policy of which the objective is to reduce the volatility relating to these
exposures. Lonza Group enters into various derivative transactions on behalf of the LSI Business, based on
Lonza Group’s treasury policy, that establishes guidelines in areas such as counterparty exposure and
hedging practices. Counterparties to agreements are major international financial institutions with at least
investment grade rating. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity
analyses. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Lonza Group Audit
Committee.

_Foreign Exchange Risk_

The LSI Business operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting
the LSI Business’ financial result and the value of its equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the
amount of local currency paid or received for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due

F-51


-----

**Note 22—Financial Risk Management (Continued)**

to changes in exchange rates (‘‘transaction exposures’’) and because the foreign currency denominated
financial statements of the LSI Business’ foreign subsidiaries may vary upon combination into the Swissfranc-denominated carve-out financial statements (‘‘translation exposures’’). Foreign exchange risks arise
primarily on transactions that are denominated in USD and EUR.

In managing its exposure regarding the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, Lonza Group has
entered into a variety of currency swaps and forward contracts on behalf of the LSI Business. These
agreements generally include the exchange of one currency against another currency at a future date. The
LSI Business adopts a policy of considering hedging for all the committed contractual exposure. The
planned exposure is hedged within certain ranges. Hedge ratios are determined by the risk committee and
depend on market expectation, risk bearing ability and risk appetite.

The table below shows the impact on post-tax profit if at 31 December a currency had strengthened (+) or
weakened (�) versus the Swiss franc, with all other variables held constant as a result of the currency
exposures outlined in the tables below:

_Interest Rate Risk_

The LSI Business’ principal interest-bearing liabilities are comprised of the loan’s payable to the Lonza
Group. As most of these borrowings bear variable interest rates that are based on inter-bank indices, the
LSI Business is exposed to interest rate risk.

The LSI Business’ exposure to interest rate risk was as follows:

**million CHF** **Note** **2020** **2019**
**(Revised)**
Net debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 1,206 828

**Interest rate exposure[(1)]** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **1,206** **828**

(1) Including effects from interest rate swap and cross currency interest rate swaps

If the interest rates had increased / decreased by 1% in 2020, with all other variables held constant, post-tax
profit would have been CHF 9 million lower / higher in 2020 (2019: CHF 6 million lower / higher).

_Commodity Price Risk_

The LSI Business needs liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as raw material for a cracker in Visp. Butane,
naphtha or propane can be used as feedstock for the cracker. The raw material ultimately used depends on
its availability and specifications. The annual demand is approximately 100,000 metric tons. In order to
minimize the risk of higher raw material prices, the LSI Business hedges the commodity price risk via
swaps. At 31 December 2020, if the propane / naphtha price had weakened / strengthened by 10%, with all
other variables held constant, other comprehensive income would have been CHF 1 million lower / higher
(2019: CHF 1 million lower / higher).

**22.5 Overview of Derivative Financial Instruments**

The following table shows the contract or underlying principal amounts and fair values of derivative
financial instruments by type of contract at 31 December. Contract or underlying principal amounts
indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair values are determined by using the difference of the prices fixed in the outstanding derivative
contracts from the actual market conditions which would have been applied at the year-end if Lonza
Group had to recover these trades.

In 2020, the Lonza Group intercompany debt structure for LSI entities in the U.S. was restructured in
anticipation of the planned divestiture. As a result, interest rate swaps were reassigned from the LSI
Business to Lonza Group through a contract assumption and transfer agreement entered into in December
2020. As a result, interest rate swaps are not included in the LSI Business carve-out perimeter for the year
ended 31 December 2020.

accounting was applied to cash flow hedges on highly probable payments in foreign currencies and for raw
materials (naphtha / propane).

**22.6 Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value**

The LSI Business applied the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation technique:

— Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

— Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly.

— Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

**2020** **2019**

**_Liabilities_**
Derivative financial instruments . . . . . . . . . 0 (2) 0 **(2)** 0 (19) 0 **(19)**

In 2020 there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.

**22.7 Carrying Amounts and Fair Values of Financial Instruments by Category**

The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables are assumed to approximate to their fair
values due to the short-term nature of trade receivables. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure
purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate
that is available to the LSI Business for similar financial instruments.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at
the balance sheet date. The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial
instruments by category.

b) The table below represents the list of legal entities which included the results of operations and assets
and liabilities of both Lonza Group operating segments (LSI and LPBN), as of 1 January 2020. During
2020 Lonza continued with the LSI carve-out activities such that, as of 31 December 2020 all of these
entities are either fully dedicated to the LSI Business or to LPBN and therefore the ‘‘carve-out’’ or
‘‘reverse carve-out’’ approach was only required for the 2020 LSI operational results as all assets and
liabilities were assigned to either a LSI or a LPBN legal entity.

**Reverse carve-out:** The LPBN Business is carved out and the legal entity forms part of the LSI
Business.

**Note 24—Events after Balance Sheet Date**

On 1 January 2021 and thereafter, Lonza Group and the LSI Business entered into various transitional
agreements to regulate future service and business relationships in anticipation of the planned divestiture
of the LSI Business. Under global service agreements, administrative functions of Lonza Group are
expected to provide various transition services to the LSI Business or vice versa in the short-term. In
addition, Lonza Group and the LSI Business entered into site service agreements for Visp (Switzerland)
and Nansha (China) as well as various service level, supply and tolling agreements in order to provide a
framework for services rendered between both parties in the mid- to longer-term. Furthermore, the LSI
Business is expected to enter into contractual agreements for office and shared space in Visp, Basel
(Switzerland) and Morristown (United States).

On 8 February 2021, Lonza entered into a definitive agreement with Bain Capital and Cinven to divest
Lonza’s Specialty Ingredients business and operations for an enterprise value of CHF 4.2 billion. The
transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.

The LSI Business has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through 31 March 2021,
the date at which the historical combined carve-out financial statements were approved to be issued and
determined that there are no other items to disclose.

**To the Management of Lonza Group Ltd., Basel**

**Report of the Independent Auditor on the Historical Combined and Carve-out Financial Statements of the**
**Lonza Specialty Ingredients Business as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019**

**Opinion**

We have audited the historical combined and carve-out financial statements of the Specialty Ingredients
Business (‘‘Carve-out Financial Statements of the Lonza Specialty Ingredients Business’’) of Lonza
Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Reporting Entity’’), which comprise the historical combined and
carve-out balance sheet as at 31 December 2019, the historical combined and carve-out income statement,
statement of comprehensive income, cash flow statement and statement of changes in equity, for the year
then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying historical combined and carve-out financial statements give a true and
fair view of the historical combined and carve-out financial position of the Reporting Entity as at
31 December 2019 and its historical combined and carve-out financial performance and its historical
combined and carve-out cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Historical Combined and Carve-out Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Reporting Entity in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession that are
relevant to our audit of the historical combined and carve-out financial statements, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Emphasis of Matter—Basis of Preparation**

We draw attention to Note 1 to the historical combined and carve-out financial statements, which describes
their basis of preparation, including the approach to and the purpose for preparing them and that the
preparation involves complex allocations of assets, liabilities and costs. Consequently, the Reporting
Entity’s historical combined and carve-out financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of the
financial performance that would have been achieved if the Reporting Entity had operated as an
independent entity, nor may they be indicative of the results of operations of the Reporting Entity for any
future period. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

We further draw attention to the fact that this auditor’s report replaces our auditor’s report dated 3 July
2020, which was restricted in use to Lonza Group Ltd in connection with the preparation of a potential sale
of the Specialty Ingredients Business. The Carve-Out Financial Statements of the Lonza Specialty
Ingredients Business have been updated in Note 24 (Events After Balance Sheet Date) for events through
the date of this report.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Historical Combined and**
**Carve-out Financial Statements**

Management of Lonza Group Ltd. is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
historical combined and carve-out financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of historical combined and
carve-out financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

F-61


-----

In preparing the historical combined and carve-out financial statements, management is responsible for
assessing the Reporting Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the Reporting Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Reporting Entity’s financial reporting
process.

**Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Historical Combined and Carve-out Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the historical combined and carve-out
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of the historical combined and carve-out financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the historical combined and carve-out
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations
or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Reporting Entity’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Reporting Entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in
our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the historical combined and carve-out financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Reporting Entity to cease to continue as a going concern.

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation**

**Reporting Entity**

The Lonza Specialty Ingredients Business (‘‘LSI Business’’) is a leading provider of microbial-control
solution offerings across various consumer and industrial markets as well as of specialty chemical services
covering composites and fine chemicals. The LSI Business addresses the coatings, composites and
agricultural markets by offering products and specialty solutions for the protection, enhanced performance
and modification of the end-use characteristics of various materials including carbon, fibers, fabrics,
leather, metals, plastics, stone and wood, as well as for agricultural ingredients.

On 3 June 2019, Lonza Group (‘‘Lonza’’, ‘‘Group’’ or ‘‘Lonza Group’’) announced its intention to proceed
with a carve-out of the LSI Business. The carve-out decision has resulted in Lonza Group operating the
LSI Business under independent management, with increased control over its operations and costs. The
LSI Business remains fully owned by Lonza. Since the announcement, the Group has commenced with the
separation and has substantially completed the carve-out process by implementing key operational changes
to separate key functions including supply chain activities, customer facing roles and other critical
functions. During 2020 certain new legal entities have been established to facilitate the organizational and
legal aspects of the LSI business carve out.

The LSI Business has been and remains part of Lonza Group and, whilst it represents a separate business,
it has not historically existed as a reporting group. Accordingly, to allow for the evaluation of the LSI
Business’ historical financial results, Lonza has prepared historical combined and carve-out financial
statements for the year ending 31 December 2019 (hereinafter, ‘‘carve-out financial statements’’ or
‘‘carve-out’’). Refer to note 23 for the overview of the entities included in the carve-out financial
statements.

These carve-out financial statements exclude, in all years presented, the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the Consumer Health & Nutrition and Water Care businesses which were both previously
part of the Specialty Ingredients operating segment of Lonza Group. Lonza Group’s Consumer Health &
Nutrition business was transferred from the LSI Business to the Lonza Pharma Biotech & Nutrition
operating segment of Lonza Group as part of a Group wide reorganization, effective as of 1 January 2019.
The related assets, liabilities and results of operations of a small portfolio of Consumer Health & Nutrition
products which are related to the core LSI Business activities were not transferred and are included in
these carve-out financial statements, as part of the LSI Business.

The Water Care business was sold by Lonza Group, effective 28 February 2019, and was presented as
discontinued operations in the Lonza Group financial statements as of and for the year ended
31 December 2018. The Water Care business is not included in these carve-out financial statements.

**Basis of Preparation**

The carve-out financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), reflecting
the fact that the LSI Business has been carved out from the larger Lonza Group.

IFRS provides no specific guidelines for the preparation of combined, carve-out financial statements,
which are therefore subject to the rules outlined in IAS 8.12. This guidance requires consideration of the
most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and
recognized industry practices.

The carve-out financial statements have been prepared based on the extraction approach, with the IFRS
consolidated financial statements of Lonza Group Ltd. and subsidiaries as of 31 December 2019
authorized for issue by the Lonza Group Ltd. Board of Directors on 4 March 2020, being the primary basis
for the preparation of the carve-out financial statements of the LSI Business. The net assets and related
historical results of the LSI Business for the year ended 31 December 2019 have been extracted from the
Lonza Group consolidated financial statements. Hence, the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities
recognized in the Lonza Group consolidated financial statements and related to the LSI Business are
generally included in the carve-out financial statements of the LSI Business.

As a general principle, the LSI Business uses the same accounting policies and principles in these carve-out
financial statements as were used for the preparation of Lonza Group’s consolidated financial statements.

F-70


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

The carve-out financial statements comprise balance sheets, income statements, statements of
comprehensive income, cash flow statements, statements of changes in equity and notes to the carve-out
financial statements.

The accounting policies and principles used in preparing these carve-out financial statements, which are
based on the historical cost convention unless stated otherwise, are the same as those used for the
preparation of the Lonza Group’s consolidated financial statements. Detailed disclosures on measurement
are provided in the summary of significant accounting policies. These policies have been consistently
applied to all of the reporting periods presented, unless stated otherwise.

_Allocation of assets, liabilities and costs_

Transactions and balances previously reported in the Lonza Group consolidated financial statements as
part of the continuing operations of the Specialty Ingredients operating segment have been directly
attributed to the LSI Business. Transactions and balances previously not directly attributed to the LSI
Business or Lonza Group’s Lonza Pharma Biotech & Nutrition Business (‘‘LPBN Business’’) have been
allocated based on the below explained methodology:

- Property, plant and equipment (‘‘PPE’’) has, in general, been specifically assigned to either the LSI
Business or LPBN Business based on the expected future user of the asset. The allocation of
employee related assets such as office furniture or computer equipment has been performed
according to the historical split of average full-time employees (‘‘FTE’’) attributable to either the LSI
Business or the LPBN Business.

- Right-of-Use assets and lease liabilities have, in general, been specifically assigned to either the LSI
Business or LPBN Business based on the expected future user of the asset. The carve-out approach
for leased assets is in alignment with the approach applied for owned PPE to ensure consistency in the
LSI carve-out financial statements. If management does not expect that a lease contract will be
allocated to LSI in the carve-out organizational structure, it remains with LPBN.

- Intangible assets mainly relating to software, have been allocated between the LSI Business and
the LPBN Business either based on the relative usage (either the historical relative percentage of
number of users of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business or the historical relative percentage of
number of FTEs of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business) or the expected future owner of the
asset.

- The LSI Business’ goodwill recorded in these carve-out financial statements originated as a result of
various acquisitions over the lifecycle of Lonza Group prior to the years presented. The allocation of
goodwill to the LSI Business is, solely for the purpose of these carve-out financial statements, based
on the historical allocation of goodwill to the LSI Business as previously defined and reported as in
the Specialty Ingredients operating segment of Lonza Group. The carrying value of the goodwill
allocated to the LSI Business for the purposes of the preparation of the carve-out financial statements
has been assessed for impairment. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units), consistent
with the impairment testing conducted at the level of the Specialty Ingredients operating segment of
Lonza Group.

- Inventories have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or LPBN Business considering
whether inventories were predominantly used by either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business in the
respective year. Where this was not possible, balances have been allocated based on the relative
historical percentage of net sales of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business.

- Receivables have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business based on
the business activities where the related sales originated from. Where this was not possible, balances
have been allocated based on the relative historical percentage of net sales of the LSI Business and
the LPBN Business.

- Accrued liabilities have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business
based on the business activities where the related costs were incurred. Where this was not possible,
balances were allocated either based on the historical relative percentage of net sales of the LSI

F-71


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

Business or LPBN Business or using the historical relative percentage of the average number of FTEs
of the LSI Business and the LPBN Business depending on the specific nature of the balance.

- Debt and financial liabilities have been allocated to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business
based on the historical usage of the proceeds from the debt. If debt may not be specifically allocated
to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business, the related liability has been allocated based on the
future obligor of the debt.

- Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments include interest rates,
foreign exchange rates (‘‘FX’’) and commodities. One variable term loan related to the LSI Business
(economic and legal borrower Lonza America Inc., guaranteed by Lonza Group AG), is allocated to
the LSI Business, consequently, the related derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps), are
also allocated to the LSI Business. FX derivatives are traded back-to-back (third party trade with
banks and Lonza’s Group treasury department and the internal (IC) trade between Lonza Group’s
treasury department and the LPBN and LSI Business), therefore these instruments were also assigned
to the relevant business (either the LPBN Business or the LSI Business). Commodity contracts are
used to hedge certain purchases of propane, butane and naphtha. Those contracts have been
historically recorded in the LSI Business and accordingly no carve-out allocations were required from
the historical reported amounts (refer to note 22).

- Trade and other payables have been specifically assigned to either the LSI Business or the LPBN
Business based on the historical business activities where the related costs were incurred. Where this
was not possible, balances have been allocated to either the LSI Business or the LPBN Business based
on the historical relative percentage of net sales of the LSI Business or LPBN Business.

- All environmental and restructuring provisions have been assigned to the LSI Business’ carve-out
financial statements if the legal entity is within the scope of the LSI Business.

- Corporate overhead functions of the Lonza Group include, but are not limited to, IT, finance, tax
planning, internal audit and HR. Costs incurred by these functions have been allocated based on the
relative percentage of net sales of the LSI Business or the LPBN Business. Lonza Group management
considers this allocation to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the
benefits received by the LSI Business during the periods presented. However, the allocation may not
be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had the LSI Business been
operating as a separate entity apart from Lonza Group. The expenses allocation is reflected as
transactions with the Lonza Group (refer to note 21).

The management of Lonza Group believes that the basis of preparation described above results in the
financial information appropriately reflecting the assets and liabilities associated with the LSI Business and
a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by LSI Business
during the periods presented relative to the total revenue, income and costs incurred by Lonza Group.
However, as the LSI Business did not operate as a stand-alone entity during the relevant periods, the
financial information may not be indicative of the LSI Business’ future performance and does not
necessarily reflect what its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had the
LSI Business operated as a separate entity apart from the Lonza Group during the relevant periods.

For an overview of the major individual components and scope of the combination of the LSI Business
refer to note 23.

_Transactions with Lonza Group (note 21)_

Transactions between the LSI Business and Lonza Group entities outside the scope of the LSI Business
have not been eliminated and are reported as related party transactions in these carve-out financial
statements.

_Capital Structure_

The LSI Business has not previously formed a separate legal group nor prepared any stand-alone financial
statements as a separate legal group, and accordingly it is not conceivable to present share capital or an
analysis of equity reserves. The equity of the LSI Business, shown as ‘‘equity attributable to Lonza Group’’,
consists of the net assets attributable to the LSI Business (including accumulated other comprehensive

F-72


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

income) and represents the cumulative net investment by Lonza Group in the LSI Business through the
dates presented, inclusive of cumulative operating net results. Changes in net assets allocated to the LSI
Business are presented separately in the carve-out statement of changes in equity attributable to Lonza
Group through ‘‘Transactions with Lonza Group’’ and in the cash flow statements through ‘‘Transactions
with Lonza Group, net’’, reflecting the activity between Lonza Group and the LSI Business during the
periods presented.

These carve-out financial statements are presented in Swiss Francs, which is Lonza Group’s reporting
currency. The individual LSI Business entities also have other functional currencies. Translation
differences arising from translating the results for the period and equity are recognized in equity
attributable to Lonza Group, assets and liabilities and their changes are presented in other comprehensive
income. The LSI Business’ external financing has historically been administered centrally by Lonza Group.

Refer to note 11 for the internal and external debt financing identified which is attributable to the
operations of the LSI Business for the financial year 2019.

_Pensions and similar obligations (note 19)_

Certain of Lonza Group’s subsidiaries operate their own pension plans. For the preparation of the
carve-out financial statements, the pension schemes applicable for the LSI Business’ employees were
analyzed. Where the respective LSI Business legal entity is not the sponsor of the pension scheme and no
stated policy is in place to recharge the pension cost from the Lonza Group to the LSI Business, the plan
has been treated as a multiemployer scheme and the employer records its contributions into the pension
scheme as an expense. Where the sponsor (legal entity) is within the scope of the LSI Business’ carve-out
financial statements, a defined benefit obligation has been reflected in the carve-out financial statements.

_Cash, cash equivalent and cash management (note 9)_

Historically, Lonza Group has performed certain cash management functions on behalf of the LSI
Business. Where the LSI Business participated in cash pooling and certain intercompany loan
arrangements were managed by the Lonza Group, amounts collected (paid) into the cash pool on behalf of
LSI Business are treated as capital contributions from or distributions to Lonza Group and presented in
the carve-out balance sheets as equity attributable to Lonza Group.

Cash and cash equivalents presented on the carve-out balance sheet exclusively relates to balances held by
legal entities which are part of the LSI Business. None of Lonza Group’s cash and cash equivalents have
been allocated to the LSI Business in the carve-out balance sheet.

_Income taxes and deferred taxes (note 18)_

Income taxes are determined based on the assumption that the components of the LSI Business are
separately taxable entities. This assumption implies that the current and deferred taxes of all components
within the LSI Business are calculated separately, and the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is also
assessed accordingly.

Due to the fact that certain components of the LSI Business did not file separate tax returns in previous
years (as for this economic activity consolidated tax returns have been or are to be filed by a Lonza Group
legal entity), the respective current tax assets and liabilities, as well as the deferred tax assets on net
operating losses, are deemed either contributed or distributed to the respective Lonza Group entity filing
the tax return, with a corresponding effect in the equity attributable to Lonza Group as of the end of the
respective fiscal year.

Management considers the approach of separately taxable entities to be the most appropriate methodology
for these carve-out financial statements purposes, but not necessarily indicative of the tax charge or benefit
that would have arisen if the LSI Business had been subject to tax separately. In preparing the carve-out
financial statements for the LSI Business, management did not include any estimated taxation impacts
related to the future divestiture of the LSI business, as the carve out financial statements are historical, and
the divestiture did not occur during the periods presented.

F-73


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax basis of the LSI Business’ assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts, using currently enacted or substantively enacted tax rates.

_Uncertainties due to estimates in the carve-out financial statements_

The carve-out financial information presented herein does not necessarily reflect the net assets, financial
position and results of operations, as well as the capital structure and the cashflow that would have resulted
if the LSI Business had already existed as an independent group during the periods presented. The absence
of any historical unit and independence of the LSI Business limits the informative value of the carve-out
financial information for these reasons. It is therefore also not possible to use the carve-out financial
information to derive any forecast about the future development of the LSI Business’ activities on a
separate basis.

Additional assumptions and estimates were made in preparing the carve-out financial statements, relating
in particular to LSI Business activities and net assets transferred and expenses allocated for administrative
services provided by Lonza Group that affect the amount and presentation of the LSI Business’ assets and
liabilities, of its income and expenses and of its contingent liabilities.

_Subsequent events (note 24)_

As previously mentioned, the preparation of the carve-out financial statements is based on the extraction
approach, thus the financial information is extracted from the consolidated financial statements of Lonza
Group (refer to description above). As a consequence, the carve-out financial statements prepared under
this approach include information about events up to the date of issue of the 2019 Lonza Group
consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, if subsequent events are identified in the period between
the date of issue of the 2019 Lonza Group consolidated financial statements and the issuance of these
carve-out financial statements, an analysis of the related recognition and disclosure requirements were
considered in these carve-out financial statements through the date of issuance, 31 March 2021.

**Changes in Accounting Standards**

There are new or amended standards that became applicable for the current reporting period. For the year
ended 31 December 2019 accounting policies had to be updated as a result of adopting the following
standards:

- IFRS 16—Leases

- IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

- Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9)

- Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28)

- Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendment to IAS 19)

- Annual Improvement to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle

Aside from IFRS 16, the adoption of the other standards did not have any significant impact on the LSI
Business’ financial statements.

IFRS 16 Leases introduced a single, on balance sheet accounting model for lessees. As a result, the LSI
Business, as a lessee, has recognized right-of-use assets representing its right to use the underlying assets
and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments. Lessor accounting remains similar
to previous accounting policies.

The LSI Business has initially adopted IFRS 16 Leases from 1 January 2019 and applied the modified
retrospective method, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in retained
earnings at 1 January 2019. Consequently, comparative 2018 information has not been restated. The LSI
Business elected to use the transition practical expedient allowing the standard to be applied only to
contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 at the date of initial
application.

F-74


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

_Nature of Lease Contracts_

The LSI Business has lease contracts for various items of buildings, machinery, vehicles and other
equipment. Before the adoption of IFRS 16, the LSI Business classified each of its leases (as lessee) at the
inception date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease was classified as a finance lease if it
substantially transferred all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the LSI
Business; otherwise it was classified as an operating lease. Finance leases were capitalized at the
commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments.

Lease payments were apportioned between interest (recognized as in the financial result) and reduction of
the lease liability. In an operating lease, the leased property was not capitalized and the lease payments
were recognized as rent expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the LSI Business applied a single recognition and measurement approach for
all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

_Summary of Impacts on LSI Business’ Financial Statements_

At transition, for leases classified as operating leases under IAS17, lease liabilities were measured at the
present value of remaining lease payments, discounted at the LSI Business’ incremental borrowing rate for
each asset class as at 1 January 2019. Right-of-use assets were measured at an amount equal to the lease
liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments.

The LSI Business applied the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously
classified as operating leases under IAS 17 (in addition to the general practical expedients described in the
chapter ‘‘Leases’’ below):

- Exemption not to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases for which the lease term ends
within 12 months of the date of initial application

- Exemption not to recognize lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (‘‘low value
assets’’)

- Exclusion of initial direct costs when measuring the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application

The impact on transition is summarized below:

**Transition Impacts from the Recognition of Right-of-use of Leased Assets and Lease Liabilities as of**

For the lease liabilities for leases that were previously classified as operating leases, the LSI Business
discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate on 1 January 2019. The weighted-average
rate applied is 3.54%.

_Impact for the Period_

The LSI Business recognized the following amounts related to leases previously classified as operating
leases in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2019:

**million CHF** **2019**

Depreciation of right-of-use assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5)

Lease payments (equal to operating lease payments under IAS 17) amounted to CHF 5 million for the year
ended 31 December 2019. Consequently, applying IFRS 16 had a favorable impact of less than
CHF 1 million on the LSI Business’ EBIT in 2019.

**Accounting Standards Issued, but not yet Effective**

The following new and revised standards have been issued but are not yet effective. They have not been
applied early in the preparation of these carve-out financial statements. The current status of the expected
effects is disclosed below:

These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the LSI Business’ carve-out financial
statements.

**Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

_Scope and Principles of Combination_

The LSI Business is spread across multiple legal entities within Lonza Group. The identification of the LSI
Business is based on a modified legal entity view. To the extent possible, all activities followed the legal
entity structure of the LSI Business. Refer to note 23 for the list of the major components and scope of
combination.

The carve-out financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the historical consolidated financial
statements of the Lonza Group. All income, expenses, assets and liabilities economically attributable to the
LSI Business were included in the carve-out financial statements.

The LSI Business’ activities can be distinguished from other Lonza Group economic activities and are
under Lonza Group’s control. As they do not comprise an existing legal entity or Group, Lonza
management prepared the LSI Business’ carve-out financial statements on a combined basis.

_Investments_

The LSI Business’ interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates, as disclosed in
note 5. Associates are those entities in which the LSI Business has significant influence, but not control or
joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Associates are accounted for in the carve-out
financial statements using the equity method of accounting. They are recognized initially at cost including
transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the carve-out financial statements include the LSI
Business’ share of the profit and loss and other comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, until
the date on which significant influence ceases.

F-76

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

_Intercompany Transactions and Transactions with Related Parties_

Intercompany transactions and related assets and liabilities between LSI Business units included in the
carve-out financial statements have been eliminated. Transactions and balance sheet items with other
Lonza Group business units previously considered as intercompany transactions in the historical Lonza
Group reporting have been treated and disclosed as transactions with related parties in these carve out
financial statements.

_Revenue Recognition_

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer und excludes
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenues are recognized when a customer obtains control of
a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
Product sales are recognized when control of the products has been transferred, i.e. when the products are
delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the sales channel and pricing of the
products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products.
Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and
loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in
accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the LSI Business has
objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. Revenues from providing services are
recognized in the accounting period in which these services are rendered. For most services, revenue
recognition over time is appropriate. This is done with reference to output (i.e. analysis delivered) to
measure the amount of revenue to be recognized. Revenue recognition over time is not applied for
customer service contracts where the consideration depends on a defined outcome or result, and its
achievement cannot be estimated. In this case, revenues are only recognized at the point in time when the
service has been completed and accepted by the customer.

_Other Operating Income and Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating income and other operating expenses include items not assignable to other functions of
the carve-out income statement. They mainly include gains and losses from the disposal of intangible
assets, property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, income and expenses from the release
and recognition of provisions, income and expenses related to restructuring, gains and losses from
currency-related operating derivative instruments, as well as operating exchange rate gains and losses.

_Net Financial Result_

Net financial result comprises interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest
method, the interest expenses on the net defined-benefit pension liability, the finance charge for finance
leases, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on financial assets and liabilities, gains and losses on
hedging instruments that are recognized in the income statement and gains and losses on sale of financial
assets. Interest income and expenses are recognized in the income statement as they accrue, taking into
account the effective yield of the asset or liability or an applicable floating rate. Interest income and
expenses include the amortization of any discount or premium or other differences between the initial
carrying amount of an interest-bearing instrument and its amount at maturity calculated on an effective
interest rate basis.

_Foreign Currencies_

Items included in the carve-out financial statements of each LSI Business component are measured using
the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (‘‘functional currency’’). The
carve-out financial statements are presented in Swiss francs, which is the presentation currency of the LSI
Business. For combination purposes the balance sheet of all LSI Business components reporting in foreign
currencies is translated to CHF with the exchange rate of the balance sheet date. Income, expenses and
cash flows of the foreign LSI Business components are translated into CHF using the monthly average
exchange rates during the year. Exchange rate differences arising from the different exchange rates applied
in balance sheets and income statements are recognized in other comprehensive income. In the individual
components’ financial statements, transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange
rate applicable at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

F-77


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

currencies at the balance sheet date are remeasured at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Exchange rate differences arising from these remeasurements are recognized in the income statement.

_Hedge Accounting_

The LSI Business uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity
price risks. The instruments used may include, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps, forward exchange
contracts, FX swaps and options. The LSI Business generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain
significant transactions. At inception of designated hedging relationships, the LSI Business documents the risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The LSI Business also documents the economic
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows
of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.

**_Cash flow hedge—This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular_**
risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction and could
affect net income. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is
included in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in cost of goods sold
(instruments to manage the commodity price exposure), other operating income and expenses
(instruments to manage the foreign currency exposure related to sales or purchases) or financial income
and expenses (foreign currency exposure related to debt repayment or interest exposure on the LSI
Business’ debt). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment
or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the
cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other
comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item at the date of
recognition. For all other cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in cost of goods sold,
other operational income and expenses or other financial income and expenses (based on the principles
explained above) when the forecasted transaction affects net income.

**_Fair value hedge—This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or_**
an unrecognized firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment,
that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect net income. The hedging instrument is recorded at
fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair
value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are reported in cost of goods sold
(instruments to manage the commodity price exposure), other operating income and expenses
(instruments to manage the foreign currency exposure related to sales or purchases) or financial income
and expenses (foreign currency exposure related to debt repayment or interest exposure on the LSI
Business’ debt).

_Property, Plant and Equipment_

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses. The assets are depreciated on a component basis over their estimated useful lives, which vary from 10 to
50 years for buildings and structures, and 5 to 16 years for production facilities, machinery, plant, equipment
and vehicles. Fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
Subsequent expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is
accounted for separately, including major inspection and overhaul expenditure, is capitalized. Other subsequent
expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the item of
property, plant and equipment. Borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalized and
included in the carrying value of the assets. All other expenditure is recognized in the income statement as an
expense as incurred. The residual values and the useful life of items of property, plant and equipment are
reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

_Leases_

The LSI Business assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration.

F-78


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

The LSI Business applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The LSI Business recognizes lease liabilities to make lease
payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and
adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of
lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, restoration costs and lease payments made at or
before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. If
ownership of the leased asset transfers to the LSI Business at the end of the lease term or the cost of the
right-of-use asset reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated
useful life of the asset.

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, considering fixed
payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that are based on an index or a
rate, amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a
purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option, less any lease incentives
receivable. Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases
across the LSI Business. These terms are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing
contracts. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an
economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options
(or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain
to be extended (or not terminated). The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable
only by the LSI Business and not by the respective lessor. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event
or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control
of the lessee.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the LSI Business uses its incremental borrowing rate at
the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The
incremental borrowing rate is derived from market information, the weighted average duration of the lease
and the underlying specifics of the leased asset. After the commencement date, the amount of lease
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.

The LSI Business applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a
purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of other
movables that are considered to be of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low
value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

In some circumstances, the LSI Business could act as a lessor. In case of a sublease, the LSI Business
would account for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease will be classified
as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

_Intangible Assets_

Purchased intangible assets with a finite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at
their fair value. Intangibles include software, licenses, patents, trademarks and similar rights granted by
third parties, capitalized product development costs and capitalized computer software development costs.
Costs associated with internally developed or maintained computer software programs are recognized as
an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the LSI Business, and that will probably generate future economic benefits
exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognized as intangible assets. Those direct costs include the
software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Intangible assets
are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which is the lower of the
legal duration and the economic useful life. Useful lives vary from 3 to 5 years for software, 5 to 35 years
for patents, trademarks and similar rights and 4 to 16 years for development costs. Trademarks acquired
through the Arch Chemicals business combination have an indefinite useful life. The LSI Business

F-79


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

considers that these trademarks have an indefinite useful life as they are well established in the respective
markets and have a history of strong performance. The LSI Business intends and has the ability to
maintain these trademarks for the foreseeable future.

_Goodwill_

Goodwill from business combinations is recognized as the surplus of the consideration transferred over the
acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the acquired net assets at cost on the acquisition date and
corresponds to the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities identified in the purchase price allocation. Goodwill is capitalized and included in
intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment. After initial recognition
goodwill is recognized at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over
the LSI Business’ share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within
investments in associates.

_Inventories_

Inventories are reported at the lower of cost (purchase price or production cost) or market value (net
realizable value). In determining net realizable value, any costs of completion and selling costs are
deducted from the realizable value. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average
method. An allocation of production overheads is included in the valuation of inventories. Costs include all
expenditures related directly to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred
in the LSI Business’ contract activities based on normal operating capacity. Adjustments are made for
inventories with a lower market value or which are slow moving. Unsalable inventory is fully written off.

_Receivables_

With the adoption of IFRS 9, effective on 1 January 2018, receivables are carried at the original invoice
amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. A receivable
represents a right to consideration that is unconditional and excludes contract assets. An allowance for
doubtful accounts is recorded for expected credit losses over the term of the receivables. These estimates
are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer balances and specific credit circumstances.
Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognized within the cost of goods sold. Receivables are
written off (either partly or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

For trade receivables, the LSI Business applies the simplified approach prescribed by IFRS 9, which
requires / permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision from initial recognition of the receivables.
The LSI Business measures an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the credit losses expected over the
lifetime of the trade receivables.

_Financial Instruments_

Since 1 January 2018, with the adoption of IFRS 9, the LSI Business has classified its financial assets in the
following measurement categories, which are disclosed in note 22: amortized costs or fair value through
profit or loss.

At initial recognition, the LSI Business measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a
financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or
loss are expensed in profit or loss.

**_Amortized cost—Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent_**
solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost, less provision for impairment.
Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using the effective interest
rate method. The LSI Business derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows
from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in
which substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest
in such transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the LSI Business is recognized as a

F-80


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

separate asset or liability. Assets at amortized cost are mainly comprised of accounts receivable, cash and
cash equivalents and loans and advances.

**_Fair value through profit or loss—hedging instruments—These are derivative financial instruments that are_**
used to manage the exposures to foreign currency, interest rates and commodity prices. These instruments
are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as
qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as cost of goods sold
(instruments to manage the commodity price exposure), other operating income and expenses
(instruments to manage the foreign currency exposure related to sales or purchases) or financial income
and expenses (foreign currency exposure related to debt repayment or interest exposure on the LSI
Business’ debt).

The fair value of derivatives (forward exchange contract, FX swaps, commodity swaps and interest rate
swaps) is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current
forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a credit adjusted risk-free rate. Current
forward prices are provided by banks or other financial service providers.

**_Debt instruments—These are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received net of transaction costs._**
They are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the net proceeds and the
redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the debt instrument using the
effective interest method.

_Cash and Cash Equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, in postal and bank accounts, as well as short-term deposits
and highly liquid funds that have an original maturity of less than three months.

_Impairment_

Assets that are subject to amortization and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an
indication that the assets may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

_Deferred Taxes_

Tax expense or income is calculated using the balance-sheet liability method. Deferred taxes are provided
wherever temporary differences exist between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in
the carve-out financial statements.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and, for deferred tax assets, operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates in the
respective jurisdictions in which LSI Business operates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the
recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For transactions and other events recognized in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity attributable to Lonza Group, any related tax effect is
recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity attributable to Lonza Group.

_Employee Benefits_

Employee-benefit liabilities as stated in the carve-out balance sheet include obligations from definedbenefit pension plans, multi-employers pension plans, other post-employment benefits (medical plans) as
well as other long-term employee-related liabilities.

F-81


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

_Defined-Benefit Plans (Pension and Medical Plans)_

The LSI Business’ net obligation in respect of defined-benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan
by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods,
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined-benefit
obligations is performed annually by a qualified external actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a potential asset for the LSI Business, the recognized asset is limited to the
present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is
given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Remeasurements of the defined-benefit liability,
which comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect
of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income.

The LSI Business determines the net interest expense on the net defined-benefit liabilities for the period
by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined-benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual
period to the net defined-benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined-benefit
liability during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other
expenses related to defined-benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss. While the net interest expense is
disclosed within financial expenses, the other expenses related to defined-benefit plans are allocated to the
different functions of the operating activities. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that related to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is
recognized immediately in profit or loss. The LSI Business recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of
a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

_Provisions_

A provision is recognized in the carve-out balance sheet when (i) the LSI Business has a legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be
made. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the liability. A provision for restructuring is recognized when the LSI Business has approved a detailed and
formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly. Future
operating costs are not provided for.

Provisions for environmental liabilities are made when there is a legal or constructive obligation for the
LSI Business that will result in an outflow of economic resources. Provisions are made for remedial work
where there is an obligation to remedy environmental damage, as well as for containment work where
required by environmental regulations.

_Share-Based Compensation_

Certain employees of the LSI Business participate in the share-based payment plans (LTIP) provided by
the Lonza Group. These plans qualify as equity-settled share-based payment plans and are settled in shares
of Lonza Group Ltd by Lonza Group Ltd.

The share-based payments are measured at fair value on the grant date. When measuring these
transactions, only those conditions which are linked to the price of Lonza’s shares (market conditions) are
taken into account, along with any non-vesting conditions.

The LSI Business estimates the number of Lonza shares which are expected to vest. Expense adjustments
due to changes in expectations regarding the number of Lonza shares expected to vest are recognized in
personnel costs for the relevant reporting period. The expense is recognized over the vesting period as part
of personnel expense and an increase in equity attributable to the Lonza Group for the best estimate of the
number of shares LSI Business expects to vest. Adjustments to these expectations are immediately
recognized in profit or loss.

If the arrangements are modified during the life of an equity-settled share-based payment plan, any
incremental fair value is recognized over the remaining vesting period. If the plan is cancelled, the rights
are assumed to be exercised on the date of cancellation and the expense is recognized immediately in

F-82


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

profit or loss. If the cancelled plan is replaced by a new share-based payment plan identified as a
replacement award, the expense is recognized in the same way as for modifications.

**Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

_Use of Estimates_

The estimates in accordance with the basis of preparation made in these carve-out financial statements are
consistent with the estimates made at the same date in accordance with the reporting requirements under
IFRS as part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Lonza Group, unless there is
objective evidence that those estimates are not in accordance with IFRS on a carve-out basis. The areas
involving a high degree of judgment, and where estimates and assumptions are significant to the carve-out
financial statements, are disclosed.

The preparation of the carve-out financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with IFRS
requires management of the LSI Business to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, income and expenses. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Estimates are used in impairment tests, accounting for allowances for doubtful receivables,
inventory obsolescence, depreciation, pension assets and liabilities, income taxes, provisions, contingencies,
and carve-out adjustments. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of
revisions are reflected in the carve-out financial statements in the period in which they are determined to
be necessary. The key assumptions about the future key sources of estimation uncertainty that entail a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year are described below.

_Impairment Test of Property, Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets and Goodwill_

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment. To assess
if any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its possible disposal. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted
future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or
closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or
lower-than-anticipated sales of products with capitalized rights could result in shortened useful lives or
impairment.

The impairment analysis as explained in note 3 is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the
discounted cash flow model, as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for
calculation purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different
cash-generating units are further explained in note 3.

_Pensions_

Many of the LSI Business’ employees participate in post-employment plans. The calculations of the
recognized assets and liabilities from such plans are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. In
particular, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is influenced by assumptions on discount
rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension liabilities and assumptions on future increases in
salaries and benefits.

Furthermore, the LSI Business’ independent external actuaries use statistically based assumptions,
covering areas such as future withdrawals of participants from the plan and estimates of life expectancy.
The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and
economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter lifespans of participants and
other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could affect the fair value of assets or
liabilities recognized in the balance sheet in future periods.

_Income Taxes_

Significant estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income
taxes. Certain of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations.
Management of the LSI Business believes that the estimates are reasonable and that the recognized

F-83


-----

**Note 1—Accounting Principles and Basis of Preparation (Continued)**

liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external factors may have
favorable or unfavorable effects on the actual amounts of estimated income tax assets and liabilities. These
factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing
interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Such
changes that arise could affect the assets and liabilities recognized in the carve-out balance sheet in future
periods. The enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 required significant
estimates to determine the adjustments of the LSI Business’ current tax expenses and its deferred income
tax assets and liabilities. These significant estimates are disclosed in note 18.

_Environmental Provisions_

The LSI Business is exposed to environmental liabilities and risks relating to its operations, principally in
respect of provisions for remediation costs. Provisions for non-recurring remediation costs are made when
there is a legal or constructive obligation and the cost can be reliably estimated. It is difficult to estimate
any future action required by the LSI Business to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal
or release of chemical substances by the LSI Business or other parties, and the associated costs, pursuant
to environmental laws and regulations. The material components of the environmental provisions consist
of costs to clean and refurbish contaminated sites and to treat and contain contamination at sites. The LSI
Business’ future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties that include, but are not
limited to, the method and extent of remediation and the responsibility attributable to the LSI Business at
the remediation sites, relative to that attributable to other parties. The LSI Business permanently monitors
the various sites identified as at risk for environmental exposures. The LSI Business believes that its
provisions are adequate, based upon currently available information; however, given the inherent
difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be
incurred beyond the amounts provided. Due to the uncertainty both of the amount and timing of future
expenses, the provisions provided for environmental remediation costs could be affected in future periods.

_Carve-out Adjustments_

The carve-out financial statements include the allocations of revenue, income, expenses, assets, liabilities
and cash flows that are described in note 1, Basis of Preparation, which are based on management
judgment, assumptions and estimates. Carve-out adjustments that involve higher degree of judgment,
assumptions and estimates in these carve-out financial statements are related to shared assets and
liabilities, allocation of goodwill, Lonza Group cost allocations, taxes and equity attributable to Lonza
Group. See a description of the allocation approach in the section Basis of Preparation above.

**Critical Accounting Judgments in Applying the LSI Business’ Accounting Policies**

In the process of applying the LSI Business’ accounting policies, management has made the following
judgments that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the carve-out financial
statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are disclosed above).

_Revenue Recognition_

The LSI Business has recognized revenues for sales of goods during the year to customers who have the
right to rescind the sale if the goods do not meet the agreed quality. The LSI Business believes that, based
on past experience with similar transactions, the quality delivered will be accepted. Therefore, it is
appropriate to recognize revenue on these transactions during the respective period. Revenues are
recognized only when, according to management’s judgment, performance obligations are satisfied, control
over the assets have been transferred to the customer and no future performance obligation exists. For
certain transactions, recognition of revenues is based on the performance of the conditions agreed in
particular contracts, the verification of which requires evaluation and judgments by management.

_Intangible Assets_

The LSI Business considers the trademarks acquired in 2011 through the Arch Chemicals business
combination to have an indefinite useful life, as they are well established in the respective markets and
have a history of strong performance. The LSI Business intends and has the ability to maintain these
trademarks for the foreseeable future. The assumption of an indefinite useful life is reassessed whenever
there is an indication that a trademark may have a definite useful life. In addition, intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis.

amortization is included in the line item ‘‘Administration and general overheads’’ of the carve-out income
statement.

The trademarks acquired through the Lonza Group acquisition of Arch Chemicals (2011) are considered
to have indefinite useful lives. As a result, these intangible assets with a carrying amount of CHF 89 million
as of 31 December 2019 (2018: CHF 89 million) are not systematically amortized.

Development costs as of 31 December 2019 predominantly include technologies acquired with the Arch
Chemical acquisition of CHF 28 million (2018: CHF 34 million).

**3.2 Impairment Tests for Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives**

The LSI Business units are the cash-generating units identified and subject to the impairment testing of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

The following cash-generating units maintain carrying amounts of goodwill as presented below (at
year-end exchange rates):

(1) Goodwill presented within Agro Ingredients will be presented in the newly organized CGU ‘‘Microbial Control Solutions’’ as of
January 1, 2020.

(2) Goodwill presented within Wood Protection will be presented in the newly organized CGU ‘‘Specialty Chemicals Services’’ as of
January 1, 2020.

The following cash-generating units maintain carrying amounts of intangible assets (other than goodwill)
with indefinite useful lives as presented below (at year-end exchange rates):

**million CHF** **2019** **2018**

**Total carrying amounts of intangible assets with indefinite useful life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **89** **89**

The recoverable amount of the above cash-generating units is based on the value-in-use calculation. The
supporting cash flow projections for 2020 to 2024 are based on the LSI Business’ strategy review and
exclude any future cash inflows and outflows expected to arise from the growth potential of future capital
expenditures.

The cash flow projections beyond the five-year period, as stated in the respective paragraphs of the
cash-generating units below, are based on the concept of perpetual growth rates, which do not necessarily
reflect the LSI Business’ strategic objective targets for the future growth potential of the underlying
businesses. The key assumptions and the approach to determining the value in use of the significant
cash-generating units are based on the following:

The LSI Business includes the cash-generating units of Consumer Product Ingredients, Agro Ingredients,
Coatings and Composites and Wood Protection. The Specialty Ingredients group of cash-generating units
are the combination of the activities acquired through the Arch Chemicals acquisition in 2011 and other
Life Science Ingredients activities from Lonza Group. The cash flow projections for 2020-2024 are based
on a 3.4% average sales growth. The cash flow projections beyond the five-year period are based on a 2.0%
growth rate. A pre-tax discount rate of 6.4% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.

A sensitivity analysis for the cash-generating units and groups of cash-generating units to which a
significant amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are allocated was performed.
The analysis was based on changes in key inputs which management considers to be reasonably possible

- a reduction in cash flows by 10%

F-87


-----

**Note 3—Intangible Assets and Goodwill (Continued)**

- or an increase in discount rate by one percentage point

- or a reduction in the perpetual growth rate by one percentage point.

Management concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill or intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives in any of the cash-generating units (or group of cash-generating units).

The LSI Business’ credit risk is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the LSI Business’
customer base and the dispersion across many different industries and regions. Management has a credit
policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. At 31 December 2019 and
31 December 2018, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to
credit risk is equal to the carrying amounts.

credit insurance for certain country risks where appropriate.

**Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs**

In 2018 Lonza Group’s centralized treasury department maintained a securitization program for its US
Business, with PNC Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and a factoring program with

**Note 7—Trade Receivables (Continued)**

ING Bank, which the LSI Business was part of. In October 2018, Lonza Group did not renew the
securitization program with PNC Bank and the contract was terminated. The ING factoring program (off
balance sheet under IFRS) was originally entered into by Lonza Group’s centralized treasury department
to sell a portfolio of certain trade receivables starting in 2013 and remains in effect as of 31 December
2019.

Under the Wells Fargo Bank program, as of 31 December 2019, the LSI Business sold trade receivables to
Capsugel Funding LLC, a Lonza Group entity outside of the LSI carve-out perimeter, amounting to
CHF 22 million. As the sale of these receivables to Capsugel does not meet the criteria for de-recognition,
the receivables and a corresponding liability are recorded in the LSI financial statements (see note 12).

Generally current and deferred income taxes are recognized by each component of the LSI Business,
regardless of having a legal liability for settlement or recovery of tax.

Refer to note 1 for significant considerations in connection with the recognition of income taxes in these
carve-out financial statements.

As the LSI Business operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in several different tax
jurisdictions. The LSI Business applies, as the carve-out tax rate, the ordinary tax rate for a legal entity in
the Canton of Valais in Switzerland of 21.6% (2018: 21.6%), because the primary country of operation of
the LSI Business is Switzerland. The LSI Business’ effective tax rate for 2019 is 26.1% (2018: 20.9%).

In assessing whether it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilize these tax losses
carry- forwards, management considers whether such benefits are recoverable on the basis of the current
situation of the company and the future economic benefits outlined in specific business plans for each
relevant subsidiary.

Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be
payable on the remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded
as permanently reinvested.

**19.1 Defined-Benefit Pension Plans**

The LSI Business operates defined-benefit pension plans in various countries, with the major plans located
in the UK and the United States (as described below). For accounting purposes, these plans are considered
as defined-benefit plans.

_Pension Plan in the UK_

The LSI Business operates the Hickson UK Group Pension Scheme. This plan is closed to new entrants. In
addition, the scheme is registered under UK legislation, is contracted out of the State Second Pension and
is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation. The plan is managed by
corporate trustee bodies, which oversee investment strategy and general regulatory compliance. The
Hickson UK Group Pension Scheme is the defined-benefit pension plan of the UK Arch Chemicals
business. Pensions are linked to final salaries and service, and statutory inflation increases apply, except
where contractually different. Ongoing contributions are sufficient to fund current accrual rates, and a
deficit recovery plan has been in place for a number of years to recover any shortfall in funding.

_Pension Plans in the United States_

The LSI Business currently sponsors three qualified defined-benefit pension plans in the United States. All
of the defined-benefit pension plans are fully frozen with respect to future benefit accruals (with the
exception of a small group of participants). All eligible U.S. employees currently participate in a definedcontribution retirement plan. Pension benefits for the majority of U.S. pension plan participants are
generally based on final average pay and credited service as of the date of termination or as of the date
benefit accruals were frozen (if earlier) and are payable as a lifetime pension. Participants in the Cash
Balance formula under the Pension Plan of Arch Chemicals are covered under an account-based formula
that is credited each year with interest based on the yield on ten-year U.S. Treasury securities. Participants
in these plans may commence benefit payments upon attainment of normal retirement age or, if
applicable, as of an early retirement age (usually age 55) provided the criteria for early retirement have
been met as of the participant’s termination of employment with the Company. Participants in the Cash
Balance plan may elect to commence benefits upon termination of employment either in a single lump sum
or as a lifetime annuity, or they may defer payment to a later date.

Pension benefit payments from the qualified pension plans are paid from a trustee-administered fund. The
qualified defined-benefit plans, whose assets are held in a master trust, are subject to minimum funding
requirements and are subject to further regulation under the Internal Revenue Code and the Employees
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Responsibility for governance of these qualified plans
lies with a committee of pension plan fiduciaries appointed by Lonza Group. Actuarial valuations are
completed each year for each plan to determine the contribution requirement. The minimum annual
contribution for each plan is equal to the present value of benefits accrued each year (if any), plus expected
administrative expenses of the plan to be paid from the trust, plus a rolling amortization of any prior
underfunding. The plan sponsor may elect to contribute more than the minimum, in which case the excess
amounts may under certain circumstances be used to offset future funding requirements.

The LSI Business expects to pay CHF 35 million in contributions to defined benefit pension plans in 2020.

The defined benefit obligation and plan assets are disaggregated by country as follows:

**million CHF** **2019** **2018**
**Rest of** **Rest of**

The significant actuarial assumptions at the reporting date (expressed as weighted averages) were as
follows:

**in %** **2019** **2018**
**US** **UK** **US** **UK**

Future pension increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.00 2.02 0.00 2.14

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published
statistics and experience in each territory. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in
years for a pensioner retiring at age 65:

**in years** **2019** **2018**
**US** **UK** **US** **UK**

Retiring at the end of the reporting period
—Male . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20.0 21.0 21.0 21.4

The sensitivity of the defined-benefit obligation to changes in the relevant actuarial assumptions is:

**million CHF** **2019** **2018**
**Change in** **Change in**
**assumption** **Increase** **Decrease** **assumption** **Increase** **Decrease**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.25% (37) 41 0.25% (34) 35
Future salary increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.25% 2 0 0.25% 0 (1)
Life expectancy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 year 44 (42) 1 year 38 (40)

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while keeping all other assumptions
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined-benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the
same method (present value of the defined-benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability
recognized within the balance sheet.

The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared
with the previous period.

**Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)**

_History and Participation_

The LTIP is an equity-based plan for the Lonza Group Executive Committee and a segment of key
employees. Certain LSI Business employees participate in the LTIP.

_Objective_

The LTIP program has been designed to align the interests of participants with those of Lonza Group’s
shareholders and to serve as a retention tool. LTIP participants are eligible to receive a number of Lonza
shares at the end of the vesting period, provided that certain performance conditions are met at the end of
the three-year performance period.

_Recognition in the carve-out financial statements_

The LSI Business’ carve-out financial statements include the share-based payment-related costs
attributable to the LSI employees entitled to the Lonza Group LTIP. These LSI Business related equitysettled share-based payment costs had an impact on the 2019 ‘‘Profit before income taxes’’ amounting
CHF 6 million (2018: CHF 4 million).

**Note 21—Related Parties**

Related parties include pension and other post-retirement funds as well as all subsidiaries, associates and
joint ventures of the Lonza Group. The key management personnel of Lonza Group consisting of the
Board of Directors and the members of the Executive Committee are considered key management of the
LSI Business and are therefore classified as related parties. Transactions with Lonza Group and key
management personnel information are disclosed in this related party note based on the allocation
methodology applied, in the preparation of these carve-out financial statements (refer to note 1).

_Legal entity clearing account_

A clearing account has historically been used for transactions within Lonza Group. It contains balancing
entries for cost allocations and transactions within a legal entity. Furthermore, the account is used for cash

**Note 21—Related Parties (Continued)**

collections and cash disbursement transactions. If cash management services are provided from the LSI
Business for non-LSI Businesses, the received cash is allocated to the non-LSI Business in the clearing
account (and vice versa). Thus, at Lonza Group consolidation level, the balance of this account is zero.

Due to the nature of the transactions in the clearing account between the LSI Business and its related
parties (Lonza Group components), the balance of the account is not zero for the LSI Business in these
carve-out financial statements. For the preparation of the carve-out financial statements, the balance of
this account is recorded in equity attributable to Lonza Group at each balance sheet date. The balance is
considered as equity and represents a net capital distribution to Lonza Group amounting to
CHF (512) million as of 31 December 2019. As of 31 December 2018, this balance represented a net
contribution received from Lonza Group amounting to CHF 250 million.

**21.2 Remuneration of Key Management of Lonza Group Allocated to the LSI Business**

In the periods presented, the LSI Business was not a legal group for consolidated reporting statement
purposes in accordance with IFRS 10 (see section ‘‘Reporting Entity’’ above).

The LSI Business was for all financial statement periods presented herein controlled by Lonza Group.
Therefore, the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of Lonza Group Ltd are deemed key
management. For information related to Lonza Group’s Board of Directors and Executive Committee
refer to Lonza Group’s publicly available annual reports.

**Note 22—Financial Risk Management**

**22.1 Overall Risk Management Policy**

The LSI Business is exposed in particular to credit and liquidity risk as well as to risks from movements in
foreign currency exchange rates and market prices that affect its assets, liabilities, and forecasted
transactions. These risks have historically been managed at the Lonza Group level. Lonza’s overall risk
management policy aims to limit these risks through operational and finance activities.

The LSI Business’ financing and financial risk management activities are centralized into Lonza Group
treasury, which manages financial exposures of the Lonza Group on account of changes in currency risks
and credit risks in a manner that is consistent with underlying business risks. In addition, capital
management of the LSI Business has also been primarily exercised and monitored at the Lonza Group
level.

**22.2 Credit Risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the LSI Business if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and mainly arises from the LSI Business’ receivables
from customers.

_Accounts Receivable_

The LSI Business’ exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. The Lonza Group Treasury function assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into
account its financial position, past experience and other factors. In monitoring customer credit risk,
customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry,
and existence of previous financial difficulties.

**Note 22—Financial Risk Management (Continued)**

Purchase limits are established for each customer, which are reviewed regularly. For customers domiciled
in specific countries with high risk, the LSI Business has credit risk insurance covering the maximum
exposure. The maximum credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the respective assets. There are no
commitments that could increase this exposure to more than the carrying amounts. In general, the LSI
Business does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables but uses credit insurance for
country risk where appropriate.

The LSI Business has a history of low credit losses on accounts receivable. Credit losses that occurred in
the past were primarily related to very few single customers. Furthermore, none of the LSI Business’
operations had a heightened exposure to credit losses in the past and based on the LSI Business’ best
estimate, this is not expected to change in the foreseeable future.

Consequently, the allowance for credit losses (as disclosed in note 7) represents primarily the credit risk of
specific customers.

_Financial Instruments and Cash Deposits_

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Lonza Group’s treasury
department. Counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly. The carrying amount of financial assets
represents the maximum credit exposure.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**Total financial assets at amortised cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **668** **555**

**22.3 Liquidity Risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the LSI Business will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The LSI Business’ approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the LSI Business’ reputation. Group Treasury maintains flexibility
in funding also using bilateral and syndicated credit lines.

The table below analyzes the LSI Business’ financial liabilities and derivative financial liabilities in relevant
maturity groupings, based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity
date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, including interest
payments. Balances due within 12 months are equal to their carrying balances, as the impact of discounting
is not significant.

**22.4 Market Risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the LSI Business’ income or the value of its
holdings of financial instruments. The LSI Business is exposed to market risk from changes in currency
exchange and interest rates and commodities. The objective of market risk management is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return on risk. Lonza
Group has established a treasury policy of which the objective is to reduce the volatility relating to these
exposures. Lonza Group enters into various derivative transactions on behalf of the LSI Business, based on
Lonza Group’s treasury policy, that establishes guidelines in areas such as counterparty exposure and
hedging practices. Counterparties to agreements are major international financial institutions with at least
investment grade rating. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity
analyses. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Lonza Group Audit
Committee.

_Foreign Exchange Risk_

The LSI Business operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting
the LSI Business’ financial result and the value of its equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the
amount of local currency paid or received for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due
to changes in exchange rates (‘‘transaction exposures’’) and because the foreign currency denominated
financial statements of the LSI Business’ foreign subsidiaries may vary upon combination into the Swissfranc-denominated carve-out financial statements (‘‘translation exposures’’). Foreign exchange risks arise
primarily on transactions that are denominated in USD and EUR.

F-105


-----

**Note 22—Financial Risk Management (Continued)**

In managing its exposure regarding the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, Lonza Group has
entered into a variety of currency swaps and forward contracts on behalf of the LSI Business. These
agreements generally include the exchange of one currency against another currency at a future date. The
LSI Business adopts a policy of considering hedging for all the committed contractual exposure. The
planned exposure is hedged within certain ranges. Hedge ratios are determined by the risk committee and
depend on market expectation, risk bearing ability and risk appetite.

The table below shows the impact on post-tax profit if at 31 December a currency had strengthened (+) or
weakened (�) versus the Swiss franc, with all other variables held constant as a result of the currency
exposures outlined in the tables below:

**Post-tax** **Post-tax** **Other** **Other**
**profit** **profit** **comprehensive** **comprehensive**

_Interest Rate Risk_

The LSI Business’ principal interest-bearing liabilities are comprised of the loans payable to the Lonza
Group and financial debt in the form of bank borrowings and lease liabilities. As most of these borrowings
bear variable interest rates that are based on inter-bank indices, the LSI Business is exposed to interest
rate risk.

The LSI Business’ exposure to interest rate risk was as follows:

**million CHF** **Notes** **2019** **2018**

Net debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 832 468
Net debt at fixed interest rates[(1)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 (199)

**Interest rate exposure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **832** **269**

(1) Including effects from interest rate swap and cross currency interest rate swaps

If the interest rates had increased / decreased by 1% in 2019, with all other variables held constant, post-tax
profit would have been CHF 6 million lower / higher (2018: CHF 2 million lower / higher).

_Commodity Price Risk_

The LSI Business needs liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as raw material for a cracker in Visp. Butane,
naphtha or propane can be used as feedstock for the cracker. The raw material ultimately used depends on
its availability and specifications. The annual demand is approximately 100,000 metric tons. In order to
minimize the risk of higher raw material prices, the LSI Business hedges the commodity price risk via
swaps. At 31 December 2019, if the propane / naphtha price had weakened / strengthened by 10%, with all
other variables held constant, other comprehensive income would have been CHF 1 million lower / higher
(2018: CHF 2 million lower / higher).

**22.5 Overview of Derivative Financial Instruments**

The following table shows the contract or underlying principal amounts and fair values of derivative
financial instruments by type of contract at 31 December. Contract or underlying principal amounts
indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair values are determined by using the difference of the prices fixed in the outstanding derivative
contracts from the actual market conditions which would have been applied at the year-end if Lonza
Group had to recover these trades.

**Note 22—Financial Risk Management (Continued)**

**22.6 Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value**

The LSI Business applied the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation technique:

— Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

— Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly.

— Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

**2019** **2018**
**Total fair** **Total fair**
**million CHF** **Level 1 Level 2 Level 3** **value** **Level 1 Level 2 Level 3** **value**

**Assets**

**Liabilities**
Derivative financial instruments . . . . . . . . . 0 (19) 0 **(19)** 0 (15) 0 (15)

In 2019 there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.

**22.7 Carrying Amounts and Fair Values of Financial Instruments by Category**

The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables are assumed to approximate to their fair
values due to the short-term nature of trade receivables. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure
purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate
that is available to the LSI Business for similar financial instruments.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at
the balance sheet date. The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial
instruments by category.

**Note 24—Events after Balance Sheet Date**

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, Covid-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020,
the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities
around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19. The outbreak of Covid-19

**Note 24—Events after Balance Sheet Date (Continued)**

and measures to prevent its spread including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged
closures of workplaces and other businesses and the related impact from closure of supply chains,
customers and associated reduction in consumer demand have had, and may continue to have, an impact
on the LSI Business’ performance.

In 2020, the LSI Business’ sales volumes, particularly in the Specialty Chemicals Solutions business, were
impacted by weaker end market demand, the closure of certain key customers and disruptions in certain
parts of the supply chain, including the temporary shutdown of certain LSI Business sites due to
government stay-at-home measures. Although the professional hygiene and home and personal care
businesses in the Microbial Control Solutions business experienced resilient levels of demand, many of the
LSI Business’ industrial markets experienced comparatively softer demand in areas such as Paints and
Coatings Material Protection and Crop Protection. As the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to
evolve the outbreak may continue to have unexpected positive and/ or negative impacts on the LSI
Business performance.

On 1 January 2021 and thereafter, Lonza Group and the LSI Business entered into various transitional
agreements to regulate future service and business relationships in anticipation of the planned divestiture
of the LSI Business. Under global service agreements, administrative functions of Lonza Group are
expected to provide various transition services to the LSI Business or vice versa in the short-term. In
addition, Lonza Group and the LSI Business entered into site service agreements for Visp (Switzerland)
and Nansha (China) as well as various service level, supply and tolling agreements in order to provide a
framework for services rendered between both parties in the mid- to longer-term. Furthermore, the LSI
Business is expected to enter into contractual agreements for office and shared space in Visp, Basel
(Switzerland) and Morristown (United States).

On 8 February 2021, Lonza entered into a definitive agreement with Bain Capital and Cinven to divest
Lonza’s Specialty Ingredients business and operations for an enterprise value of CHF 4.2 billion. The
transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.

The LSI Business’ historical combined carve-out financial statements for the financial year ending
31 December 2019 were approved for issue by Lonza Group on 31 March 2021.
