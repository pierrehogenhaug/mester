As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Indenture, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,112,NOTICE TO U.S. INVESTORS,112.10,England,112.10.1,,"The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England is based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and English legal advisers. The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (amongst other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the court which pronounced it; - the U.S. judgment being for a sum of money (whether debt or damages), but not being for payment of money in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, a fine or other penalty; - the U.S. court’s procedures not having breached the rules of natural justice; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud; - enforcement of the U.S. judgment not being contrary to either public policy in England and Wales or the United Kingdom Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for loss or damage sustained by the U.S. judgment creditor and not being otherwise in breach of, or unenforceable under, Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not being inconsistent with a prior judgment of an English court or the court of another jurisdiction on the same subject matter, and on the same issues in question between the same parties; - the U.S. proceedings were brought in compliance with, or otherwise not contrary to, a jurisdiction or arbitration agreement; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the limitation period. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

We place significant emphasis on delivering individualized teaching and learning and providing exceptional student outcomes, irrespective of students’ individual abilities. The majority of our schools follow a non-selective admissions policy and we seek to support each student in achieving outcomes to the best of his or her ability through our commitment to high standards in all aspects of teaching, care and school management. We strengthen this approach by setting individualized learning goals which provide the right level of challenge and support for growing minds and by implementing processes for regularly tracking and benchmarking student attainment. We employ a systematic approach to student enrollment and retention across our platform and use our global scale and diverse expertise to build best practice in all our school. We operate in developed and developing markets and our success in increasing enrollment reflects the underlying strength and favorable dynamics of these markets. The developed and many of the developing markets in which we operate (such as Vietnam and Thailand) are characterized by stable market fundamentals, including a large middle class and a strong and established private school presence. Our success in the developing markets in which we operate is based, in part, on the sizeable pools of expatriate families in these markets, the increasing wealth among local families, each of whom value and demand high quality education for their children and the increasing demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours. Substantially all of our revenues are from private-pay sources without exposure to changes in government funding. Our operations are backed by a large and attractive portfolio of well-invested and well-maintained campuses and facilities. Our real estate portfolio comprises of 126 sites, of which 36 are owned on a freehold basis and the remaining 90 are leasehold properties on lease terms that we believe are favorable for our operations. The 1 ----- average remaining tenure with respect to our leasehold school properties is 23 years. The book value of our real estate portfolio at cost as at August 31, 2018 was £559.6 million. See “Business—Properties” for more information on our properties. We organize our business into the following operating segments:",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Structurally growing market,"We operate in the large and growing global private-pay K-12 education market. Although we operate globally, our operations have a strategic focus on high value, growing, gateway markets such as: Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City (“HCMC”), Hong Kong, Bangkok, Madrid, Barcelona and London. According to the Market Report, between academic years 2015-2018 (except for Hong Kong, which is measured from academic year 2014-2018), Pre-K-12 revenue in these attractive segments grew at an annual CAGR as follows: Singapore (6%); HCMC (14%); Hong Kong (10%); Bangkok (includes the Eastern Seaboard region) (8%); Madrid (7%); Barcelona (11%) and London (6%). With existing facilities and experience in each of these gateway cities, we consider ourselves well positioned to capture some of this market growth. Revenue growth in the market is underpinned by high growth in private school enrollments compared to public enrollments. According to UNESCO, in Europe there were approximately 16 million private K-12 students in 2016 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 8% from 2011 to 2017, in Latin America (including the Caribbean) there were approximately 25 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 1% from 2011 to 2017 and in Asia (including Central, Southern, Eastern and Southeast regions) there were approximately 198 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 3% from 2011 to 2017. Research by Euromonitor and Oxford Economics suggests that the relevant school going population for the private K-12 market (aged 3-17 year olds) grew by a CAGR of 0.9% across our key European and Asian markets from 10.6 million in 2015 to 10.9 million in 2018 and is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 0.9%, reaching 11.4 million by 2023. Demand for our schools is driven by both local and expatriate demand. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we had approximately 75% of local students and 25% of expatriate students. The exact percentage of expatriate students varies significantly country-by-country. Our schools in Hong Kong and Vietnam rely on approximately 49% and 58% expatriate students, respectively, whereas our schools in Chile and Brazil entirely rely on local demand. _Local Demand_ The developing markets, in which our schools target local families, have seen both strong parental aspirations not met by public education and an increase in household disposable income in recent years, which has made private education both more affordable and more desirable for an increasing number of families. Furthermore, we believe that demand for private education in these regions is supported by the importance that parents and students living in non-English speaking countries place on English language fluency, which, in turn, supports 2 ----- demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours, most of which have an English-language offering. Additionally, there is an increasing desire among parents for their children to study abroad at foreign universities. This in turn drives demand for private-pay K-12 schools, such as ours, that are perceived to have a strong record of student placements to reputed higher education institutions. Many of our schools offer college counseling and pre-university programs. We believe that these increases in disposable income, combined with the demand for high quality education, are key drivers of growth in student enrollment in private-pay K-12 schools in these markets. _Expatriate Demand_ The international markets in which we serve expatriate families, including Singapore, HCMC, Hong Kong, Bangkok, London, Barcelona and Madrid are located in countries that have experienced strong GDP growth, with an associated increase in expatriate populations who, we believe, prioritize quality and continuity of education for their children and seek schools that provide a similar curriculum and academic standards as schools in their home countries. The following table shows the annual growth in GDP between 2015 and 2018 and the estimated annual growth in GDP between 2018 and 2023 in our key regions, according to the IMF: **2015-2018** **2018-2023** Singapore . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 3% Vietnam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7% 7% Hong Kong . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 3% Thailand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4% 4% UK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2% 2% Spain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 2% The following table shows enrollment growth between the academic year 2015 and 2018 (except for Hong Kong, which is measured from academic year 2014-2018) and the estimated enrollment between 2018 and 2023 in our key expatriate cities, according to the Market Report: **2015-2018** **2018-2023** Singapore . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 3% HCMC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9% 7% Hong Kong . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5% 4% Bangkok[(1)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4% 3% London . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2% 2% Barcelona . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6% 5% Madrid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4% 2% Note: (1) Includes the Eastern Seaboard region. We expect this continued growth in GDP to result in growing expatriate populations in these countries and to lead to increased enrollments. In addition, many employers support expatriate education expenditure, which often takes the form of reimbursements to parents for tuition fees, direct payment of fees to educational institutions or lump sum payments that parents can use to pay tuition fees, if they so choose. Employer support influences demand for high-quality education by affecting the affordability of private-pay K-12 education for expatriate families.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

In February 2017, we established an Education Advisory Board (“EAB”) to drive outstanding educational practices across the Group and focus on evidence to improve academic outcomes. The EAB chaired by Sir Kevan Collins, who is currently the Chief Executive of the Education Endowment Foundation (an independent charity organization dedicated to the improvement of the educational attainment of underprivileged students in English schools). The EAB’s mission is to accelerate academic improvement, build teacher capacity, share effective best practices and establish external partnerships. We have developed the “Cognita Way,” which is a framework we use to drive improvements at our schools and maintain the high level of education valued by Parents through: - _Energized Leadership: We believe that a key to driving improvement and academic success for our students is the academic vision of our Head Teachers. As such, we have a careful recruitment process for our school Head Teachers. Once Head Teachers are hired, we endeavor to ensure stability over time by investing in our leaders to inspire and share best practices they develop. - _Personalized Learning: We focus on high quality learning in each classroom and on providing the right level of challenge and support for each student and we underpin this approach with data and predictive tools to track student progress, benchmark individual student attainment and allow us to make informed decisions based on the student’s particular situation. - _People Growth: We view employing skilled and well-educated teachers at all of our schools as an important driver of the success of our product offering, and we have a professional and diligent approach to recruitment and selection, with tailored practices specific to each region. We also invest in the professional development of our teachers to help them to enhance their skills as well as to maintain high motivation levels, for example, by providing career advancement prospects and the opportunity for teachers with high potential to complete Masters programs in education. By operating as a global group, we also provide internal opportunities to our teachers such as workplace shadowing and secondments, which may not be available with single school operators. In addition, our global platform and Group central and regional management teams free up school management and teachers from dealing with commercial and administrative matters so that they have more time to focus on high quality teaching and learning. - _Community: We actively seek to listen to and engage with the key people in each school community. We run a consistent system for gathering feedback across all regions through engagement with students (Voice of Students, VoS), parents (Voice of Parents, VoP) and employees (Voice of Employees, VoE) and utilization of CSAT tools such as Confirmit. Additionally, we work with a range of associations and accreditation bodies and school inspectorates and engage with the global education sector through participation in debates and conferences and partnerships with leading independent schools. - _Innovation: We strive to maintain innovative curricula at our schools and constantly seek to implement new learning solutions and programs, both in the classroom, such as our full bilingual and English as an Additional Language (EAL) programs, and outside of the classroom, such as our outdoor learning and leadership development programs through our ALG division. - _Brilliant Basics: We have developed systems and best-practices that are applied across our network to ensure that all of our schools are run according to the highest standards of safeguarding and health and safety, allowing us to maintain accreditation and comply with local regulatory frameworks to help streamline the operation of our schools. We have also implemented a global finance system and we are in the process of implementing global solutions for HR, admissions and marketing. - _International accreditations: We have received accreditations from the leading international educational organizations, such as Cambridge Assessment International Education, Council of International Schools, COBIS, IB World School and NEASC. We are an outward looking organization, looking to learn from best practices globally. 5 ----- Our continued focus on high quality education has enabled our schools to achieve examination outcomes which are generally well above the relevant national, regional or global averages for each curriculum despite the fact that the majority of our schools are non-selective, for example: - Over the past three years, our British curriculum schools in the United Kingdom and Spain consistently achieved GCSE outcomes (in Math and English) significantly above the United Kingdom national average. - Over the past five years, students at our IB curriculum schools achieved outcomes ahead of the “world average” despite being non-selective schools, whilst the IB curriculum is, in many cases, offered by selective schools. - The Australian International School consistently achieves well on the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (“ATAR”) when compared to New South Wales. In 2017, the school had a mean ATAR score of 75.3 compared to a mean ATAR score of 70.0 for New South Wales. Additionally, 48% of AIS students gained an ATAR score over 80 points. - Over the past 10 years, our schools in Chile and Brazil have achieved PSU results (the standardized university examination used in Chile) and ENEM results (the standardized university examination used in Brazil) well above the respective national averages.

We continue to invest in our people who are integral to this mission of delivering academic excellence and to develop processes that allow us to bring the benefits of our global scale to the individual student. We will also continue to develop a tailored educational offering, which appeals to the specific parent and student demographic of each of our schools and focuses on personalized learning and will continue to implement innovative approaches to education, including language development programs (such as daily Mandarin in our Singapore schools), bilingual and English as second language curricula, unique educational experiences (such as outdoor leadership programs and summer camps through our Active Learning Group (“ALG”) and direct university partnerships offering college credits), high quality athletic programs and extensive co-curricular clubs and activities.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

84,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.12,Our Strategy,9.12.4,Continue to look for expansion and acquisition opportunities in existing and selected attractive and scalable markets,"Having successfully completed over 40 acquisitions since 2004, we are a natural consolidator and growth leader in the sector. We added nearly 5,000 seats in premium markets over the past year. Our growth has been 8 ----- thoughtful and has been driven by targeted development (through acquisitions, greenfields and expansions), based on data and insights, which has complemented embedded growth stemming from our ability to drive enrollments and fill available capacity at our existing schools. Our track-record of acquisitions, greenfield projects and expansions has demonstrated our ability to create and fill new additional capacity. For example, enrollments grew at the Stamford American International School in Singapore (our first greenfield development) from approximately 109 students in fiscal year 2010 to approximately 2,900 students in fiscal year 2017. Likewise, following our acquisition of the British School of Barcelona, enrollments grew by 84% during the same period. Successfully implemented transactions such as these, where we preserve and enhance the quality of the acquired school in addition to growing enrollment, have further demonstrated our ability to transact in many markets and have made us a buyer-of-choice for family and trusts. Our data driven approach has resulted in us developing a proprietary pipeline of opportunities curated over more than 10 years. We intend to continue to evaluate both strategic expansion, acquisition and greenfield opportunities to develop capacity in markets in which we have experience or which we have identified as attractive based on rigorous analysis of the relevant market dynamics. We have identified a number of additional capacity expansion opportunities in certain regions. For example, we are in the process of developing the ELIS school in Murcia, Spain and we are embarking on the second phase of expansion at the Stamford American school in Hong Kong. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to enter new regions such as the Middle East and expanding into new markets in Asia and Latin America.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

We define EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation, amortization of other intangibles and impairment. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before Non-underlying costs. We define Group Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA including 100% of joint venture (St Nicholas Preparatory School) Adjusted EBITDA. We define Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for the full-year effect of completed acquisitions, the incremental EBITDA from confirmed September 2018 enrollment, the expected in-year net growth in Average FTE Students and the expected pro forma EBITDA contributions of acquisitions currently in exclusivity. Investors should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to profit/(loss) before taxation as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as an alternative to net cash outflows or inflows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. Because companies do not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA identically, our presentation of such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors should also note that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented above are calculated differently from “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined and used in the Indenture and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in our Financial Statements. See “Description of the Notes— _Certain Definitions” for a definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Indenture. See our Financial Statements for a presentation of_ Adjusted EBITDA.

(b) Restructuring costs during the periods under review mainly relate to employment cessation, management restructuring and associated legal costs (£4.7 million, £2.5 million, £2.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively), school closing costs (£2.2 million, £3.6 million, in 2016 and 2017, respectively associated with Chilton Cantelo, Cranbrook, Sackville and Avondale schools and a credit of £1.2 million in 2018 driven by the £1.9 million release of the Avondale provision originally made in 2017) and £1.4 million charge associated with the acquisition accounting of the remaining 50% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture in 2017. (c) Acquisition and business exploration costs include expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or expansion opportunities (including legal and due diligence fees) as well as marketing and other expenses incurred prior to the opening of new schools. (d) Other non-recurring items includes non-cash charges relating to the management incentive plan (£3.95 million, £0.25 million and £14.79 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively) and gains/(losses) on disposals of fixed assets (£0.04 million, £0.28 million and £(0.37) million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively). In 2018, it also included £8.3 million of the costs associated with the Acquisition. (e) Represents the portion of EBITDA derived from the St Nicholas Joint Venture to reflect 100% ownership of the joint venture. (f) Gives effect to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of (i) three acquisitions which were completed during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (Woodland, ABS and Santo Tomas) and (ii) the acquisition of CEM, which completed in November 2018 after the fiscal year end, as if each of them was completed on September 1, 2017. The adjustment is based on the historical EBITDA of the 24 ----- entities acquired derived from management accounts for the twelve-month period ended as close to August 31, 2018 as available and adjusted in a manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to the extent applicable. (g) Gives effect to the estimated incremental EBITDA from confirmed September 2018 enrollment (and confirmed enrollment for ALG, Camp Asia and the Woodland Pre-Schools for fiscal year 2019). In estimating the incremental EBITDA, we have (i) applied constant fiscal year 2019 prices and 2018 margin to the confirmed September 2018 enrollment student numbers, (ii) given effect to certain expected operational efficiencies as a result of the higher utilization the confirmed September 2018 enrollment may bring and (iii) forecasted a certain growth in central costs independent from the confirmed September 2018 enrollment. (h) Gives effect to the estimated in-year net growth in Average FTE Students from October 1, 2018 (including estimated net growth in Average FTE Students as a result of enrollments at our schools in Latin America and our Australian curriculum schools where the academic year commences in January). The adjustment is based on historical rates of in-year net growth in Average FTE Students per school plus any management adjustments to reflect relevant market conditions, competition and other factors for such school. In arriving at the estimated incremental EBITDA from estimated in-year net growth in Average FTE Students, we have (i) applied constant fiscal year 2019 prices and 2018 margin to the estimated in-year net growth numbers, (ii) given effect to certain expected operational efficiencies as a result of the higher utilization the estimated in-year net growth may bring and (iii) forecasted a certain growth in central costs independent from the estimated in-year net growth. (i) Gives effect to the Adjusted EBITDA of four of the Specified Acquisitions as if each of them was completed on September 1, 2017. The four acquisition opportunities are subject to non-binding memoranda of understanding and are in exclusivity: (i) the first is in Chile and has Average Student Capacity of 1,481, Average FTE Students of 1,304, Average FTE Staff of 91 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, (ii) the second is also in Chile and has Average Student Capacity of 1,980, Average FTE Students of 1,717, Average FTE Staff of 181 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, (iii) the third is in Spain and has Average Student Capacity of 1,080, Average FTE Students of 853, Average FTE Staff of 120 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 and (iv) the fourth is in the UK and relates to a complimentary business offering extra-curricular language program to students around the world, which administered approximately 15,000 student weeks of language programs globally during the twelve months August 31, 2018. Each of the specified acquisition opportunities is independent and the signing and closing of any one of the specified acquisition opportunities is not conditional on the signing and closing of any of the others. None of the acquisition opportunities on a stand-alone basis represents more than 30% of the total adjustment. The adjustment is based on the historical EBITDA of the entities acquired for the twelve month-period ended August 31, 2018 and adjusted in a manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to the extent applicable. We expect to finance the Specified Acquisitions (in part) with drawings from the B2 Facility. (j) The pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA presented above are for informational purposes only and do not purport to present what either the newly acquired or existing schools’ results of operations and financial condition would have been, nor do they purport to project such schools’ results of operations for any future period or financial condition at any future date. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA presented above are based on our current estimates, and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such pro forma financial information. Some of the factors that could result in the newly acquired or existing schools’ results of operations not achieving the anticipated Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA include the failure to adequately integrate new acquisitions into our network or slower integration than expected, adverse macroeconomic conditions in the regions where the new schools are located, increased competition from local or other international school operators and the failure to retain existing students at the school and/or increase enrollments to meet unfilled capacity. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— We may not realize any or all of our _anticipated pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA included in this Offering Memorandum.”_ (2) Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage and Group Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Group Adjusted EBITDA divided by Group revenue, expressed as a percentage. (3) Includes 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2017. (4) We track the amount of capitalized operating capital expenditure and development capital expenditure in our management information from a balance sheet perspective. We have used this information to present operating capital expenditure and development capital expenditure in this Offering Memorandum. Our cash flow information only reflects our aggregate capital expenditure. As we do not track the split of cash flows attributable to operating capital expenditure and development capital expenditure, we have used the amount of operating capital expenditure based on management information from a balance sheet perspective for the purposes of calculating Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow. (5) Development capital expenditure represents investments made to expand capacity at our schools and/or for the construction and development of other large investments in facilities which do not directly result in capacity expansion. (6) Operating capital expenditure represents investments made to maintain our equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and to improve our teaching and learning infrastructure. This includes the ongoing replacement and upgrading of fixtures and fittings and IT equipment, including computers and laptops. (7) We define Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less operating capital expenditure less net change in working capital and other operating cash flow items less Non-underlying costs (for a description of Non-underlying costs, please see items (a), (b), (c) and (d) under footnote (1) above). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows—Net Cash Inflow from Operating Activities.” Operating cash conversion_ rate is defined as the ratio of Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow to Adjusted EBITDA. The table below shows the calculations of Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow and operating cash conversion rate. Before operating capital expenditures and non-underlying costs, 25 ----- operating cash conversion was 104.8%, 104.4% and 115.2% for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

In addition, as of August 31, 2018, we also had £1.8 million available under our Local Facilities and £100 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, including overdraft facilities and working capital facilities, which have not been included in adjusted total debt since they are undrawn commitments. See “Summary—The B2 Facility.” (11) As adjusted net secured debt represents as adjusted net total debt less the Notes as of August 31, 2018. (12) As adjusted interest expense represents interest payable for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if it had occurred on September 1, 2017, assuming the B2 Facility is fully drawn and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn for such period.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries has been derived from or developed by applying adjustments to our historical results as of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if it had occurred on August 31, 2018 with respect to balance sheet data and September 1, 2017 with respect to data derived from our profit and loss account. The unaudited adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, actually occurred at the beginning of the period or on the date indicated, and such information does not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial_ statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

A number of factors may contribute to a decline in student enrollment rates at our schools, including competition from other providers, poor macroeconomic conditions in local markets, political instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, expatriate relocation, graduation, decline in student performance or parent satisfaction, maintaining curricula that are attractive to students and parents or other disruptive events which could cause the temporary or permanent closure of any of our schools. We may be unable to maintain and/ or increase enrollment rates in our schools if we are unable to secure new students through our recruitment efforts. In addition, if we fail to maintain the quality of our educational offerings, parents may choose not to re-enroll or may remove their children from our schools.

The opening of the Stamford American School in Hong Kong, represented an expansion into a new country, where we may find challenges related to cultural differences and relationships with local education authorities and other regulatory bodies. A second phase of the development is underway and as a result, the school is only partially open. The school has had a strong opening with approximately 600 pupils currently enrolled, however its success is dependent on continued evolved growth in future years. Our development project in Singapore and the opening of the Early Learning Village increased our footprint in the country, but also exposes us to macroeconomic risks should the Singapore economy and/or the number of expatriate visitors decline. A decline in the Singapore economy could also have a negative adverse impact on the existing business as well as the new development. Our expansion project in London added a further site in the Southbank International School and in Spain a new pre-university campus has been added to the British School of Barcelona. Where we have ongoing construction projects funded from Group resources, as is the case in Hong Kong, there could be currency exposure where the funds available to draw are different from the future liabilities of constructing the asset.

The factors that could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our tuition fees include: - negative perceptions of the quality of our educational offerings; - resistance to tuition increases by tuition payers for reasons such as difficult economic conditions or previous fee increases in recent academic years; - the requirement for regulatory approval to increase tuition fees in some of the markets in which we operate; - reductions or discounts of tuition by local education providers that seek to compete in our markets; - competition from local education providers that may offer lower tuition fees or that may not increase tuition fees in line with us; and 30 ----- - adverse reactions from parents at one or more of our schools, which may result in demands from parents for increased services or subject us to parent scrutiny over staff pay awards. In addition, market or regulatory factors may limit our ability to maintain or control staff costs, which could have an adverse effect on our operational costs and profitability. For example, we may be required to offer additional compensation or benefits to our staff to satisfy independent unions or other collective bargaining bodies or agencies or to maintain competitive compensation packages in a particular market.

Although the timing and nature of the UK’s separation from the EU remains unclear, there are currently no significant adverse implications to business operations and results to report. However, there are some potential risks that could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition: - The Group has entered into and may in the future enter into forward exchange contracts in respect of the Notes and the Senior Facilities, however fluctuations in exchange rates will impact Group results which are reported in Pound sterling. - London’s status as a financial centre could be compromised, which in turn could impact the demand for international schools. - We may find it harder to attract and retain students and teachers from the EU if visa entry requirements become more stringent or if our UK Visas and Immigrations Tier 2 and/or Tier 4 licences are revoked or cease to be renewed. - The use of British qualifications for Spanish university entry and number of Spanish students applying to British universities may be impacted. - A significant adverse impact to the UK or European economy could lead to a decline in demand for independent school places in the UK and Spain which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others that we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to our Business,13.1.5,We may be adversely impacted by the macroeconomic environment.,"Our operations are affected by the general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we operate. These macroeconomic conditions are monitored on an ongoing basis along with the impact on our current and future financial performance. Risks identified during the year included the ongoing potential implications arising from the British referendum on the EU, softening in the growth outlook for the Asia region driven by global macroeconomic environment changes compared to mid-2015, the independence debate within the Catalonia region of Spain and general economic pressure and potential political and regulatory changes in the Latin America region. Additionally, changes in the compensation and benefits packages of those expatriates whose employers pay for their children’s tuition fees may negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our tuition fees. A change from direct payment from the employer to a cost of living adjustment in the form of a lump sum payment in cash to expatriate parents may cause such parents to become more price sensitive in respect of the tuition they are willing to pay. Even though to date these factors have had a limited impact on our financial performance due to the importance of education for parents and the general stability of the markets in which we operate, as well as our focus on controlling our costs, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition in the future and as a result, we will continue to monitor developments and the potential related risks.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Our ability to deliver high quality education across a range of curricula is directly related to, and 31 ----- dependent on, the availability of qualified teachers and our ability to continue to recruit, employ, train and retain such teachers. In addition, our ability to retain and, where necessary, attract teachers, principals, school administrators and support staff is important for our operations in providing premium education. The process of hiring staff with the combination of skills and attributes required to implement our business strategy can be difficult and time-consuming. We face competition in attracting and retaining staff who possess the necessary experience and accreditation to teach at our schools. Predicted growth in the number of international schools across the world is likely to increase competition for qualified and experienced staff in the coming years making it even more important for us to be competitive and promote a great place to work. We may experience particular difficulty in recruiting staff who are willing to relocate from their home country to some of our international locations and we must provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain qualified individuals to join our schools. In addition, some of our teachers could choose to remain at the school only for a limited period of time, which could affect our reputation in the market if we provide insufficient continuity. As we continue to expand and add personnel, we may face additional difficulty in maintaining consistency in the quality of the teaching staff that we recruit. A shortage of quality teaching personnel and a high turnover rate of staff could lead to ineffective delivery of the curricula offered to students, impacting their academic performance and the reputation and brand of our schools. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain qualified and effective teachers, principals, school administrators and support staff at our schools, our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Some of our existing and potential competitors may choose to devote more resources to the development of schools offering premium quality education and respond more quickly to changes in parents’ and students’ demands, curriculum offerings, admissions standards, market needs or new technologies. Moreover, our competitors may increase capacity to an extent which may lead to an over-supply in certain of our markets. If we are unable to differentiate our schools from those of our competitors and successfully market our schools to parents and students, we could face competitive pressures that may result in a decrease in enrollments or an increase in students switching to other schools. To the extent our school enrollment may decrease, we may be required to reduce our tuition rates or increase spending in order to improve facilities in an effort to retain or to attract students.

As a result, our success depends in part upon our ability to adapt to and succeed in differing economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions. In particular, financial risks associated with our operations include risks of liquidity, inflation, devaluation, price volatility, currency convertibility and exchange rates and actual or perceived risk of country default resulting from significant deficits. In the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, we generated 31.2% of our Adjusted EBITDA from our operations in Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil and Chile. Such emerging economies are more susceptible to global economic trends and higher inflationary pressure, which could result in decrease in demand or a heightened sensitivity to moderate pricing increases in tuition fees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Some of these countries lack highly developed legal systems and are susceptible to high levels of corruption. Our operations in emerging economies increase our exposure to anticorruption laws, or similar laws. Furthermore, our operations in such economies are governed by local laws and regulations, including those applicable to foreign investments and to foreign-owned enterprises. Such laws and regulations may be vague, uncertain and difficult to interpret. Furthermore, implementation and enforcement of regulation is not always consistent or predictable. For example, the rise of a populist government or new tax laws or regulations could have a negative impact upon our business. We may experience difficulties or delays in obtaining permits or other governmental authorizations required to operate our schools and restrictions as to the eligibility criteria of students. Exposure to regulatory uncertainty could limit our legal protection and ability to comply with regulations applicable to us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. 32 ----- In the United Kingdom, the Government-backed Teacher Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”) of which the majority of our UK teaching staff are members, announced in October 2018 a proposal to increase employer pension contributions to the Scheme from 16.4% to 23.6% of members gross salary. The proposal is currently in consultation and would take effect from September 2019. If implemented in full, this could lead to an increase in costs in the United Kingdom of approximately £2-£3 million per annum. In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we generated 7% of our Adjusted EBITDA from our school in the Catalonia region in Spain. The regional government of Catalonia held a non-binding referendum in October 2017 that backed independence by a large margin of those taking part in the vote. The Spanish government declared the referendum illegal and maintains that Catalonia has no constitutional right to break away, and imposed direct rule on the region after the regional government in Barcelona declared independence. Exposure to political uncertainty could lead to changes in laws, regulations and the macro-economic environment in Catalonia. This could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial conditions in the region. Unstable political conditions, civil unrest, student uprisings or other developments in the countries where we operate could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. For example, a natural disaster in any country in which we operate could adversely impact the performance of one or more of our schools in that region.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

We are required to consult and seek the advice of unions with respect to a broad range of matters, which could prevent or delay new initiatives. At present, we have three organized unions in Chile (Penalolen, ABS and Santo Tomas) and collective bargaining agreements in place for all three unions. In Brazil, all employees are unionized by law. The collective bargaining agreements are negotiated at a state or municipal level and they directly effect our employees’ contracts. For example, we are required to consult unions in order to get approval for agreements varying individual employees’ working hours and for requesting teachers to work on a winter or summer camp. If relationships with our teachers and other staff or the unions that represent them become adverse, we could experience labor disruptions, such as strikes. Labor disruptions, which are generally more likely to occur when collective bargaining agreements are being renegotiated, could harm our relationship with our teachers and other staff or cause strained relationships with parents and students and could result in temporary disruptions to our ability to operate schools where such labor disruptions occur. For example, in Chile we have had strikes or threats of strikes in relation to the Penalolen union. Additionally, in Brazil, there was a one-day teacher strike in 2018, which came amid a wave of strikes in other industries in the country. Future labor disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, labor regulation or the settlement of labor disputes could lead to higher wage and benefit costs and increased operating expenses and legal costs. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. For example, the collective bargaining agreements for the three Chilean unions will expire in 2021, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We may also be subject to or affected by labor disruptions unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Due to our operation of several schools within one group, we are also exposed to the risk that a labor dispute or settlement of such at any one school may result in similar disputes or a requirement for similar settlements at other schools within our Group. Any such labor disruptions or potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. Although management believes that its relationship with teachers and other staff is generally good, there can be no assurance that there will not be labor disputes and/or adverse employee relations in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

To transfer funds between jurisdictions, we rely principally on intercompany loans, cash pooling arrangements, dividends and the payment of management fees.

Although Southbank International School conducted background checks consistent with the legislative requirements at the time, and while independent inspections prior to the discovery of such conduct had found the school to be compliant (either on initial inspection or on re-inspection following the identification of compliance issues), we commissioned an independent review that concluded that there were aspects of the school’s recruitment and other practices that could be improved. The findings from a UK statutory Serious Case Review were published in January 2016 and the recommendations included therein supported those made in the independent review. National and international police investigations, which have been widely reported in the United Kingdom national media, were conducted with respect to the former teacher, since deceased.

Since our inception in 2004, we have acquired nearly all of our 71 schools across various countries. The success of our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, to assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of such acquisition targets, the availability of sufficient financial or operational resources to fund such acquisitions, to negotiate acceptable purchase terms and to integrate the operations of such businesses, once acquired. Successful integration of acquired schools will depend on our ability to effect any required changes in operations or personnel, and may require renovation or other capital expenditure or the funding of unforeseen liabilities, especially if we discover non-compliance in circumstances where recourse against the seller is either not advisable or not available. The integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including unanticipated costs, expenses and liabilities, including latent or potential liabilities that relate to the time prior to our acquisition of a school but only becomes apparent after we have taken control of such school, difficulties in integrating the acquired schools in a timely and cost-effective manner or maintaining standard controls, policies and procedures across all our schools, the establishment of effective management information and financial control systems, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues, such as defects in existing licenses arising out of the acquisitions.

These difficulties and related risks are heightened by the growth of our business. We may incur greater costs and achieve fewer savings as a result of maintaining multiple IT systems than we would if the number of IT systems in use across all our jurisdictions were rationalized.

Pursuant to other contractual arrangements that have been put in place with such Thai national nominee, all rights and 95% of the economic benefits to the shares of BEMS have been unconditionally assigned to Cognita Asia Holdings Pte.

St. Andrews Dusit Campus Company Limited (Thailand), which operates St. Andrews International School Dusit, is majority owned by Thai nationals and Thai corporations, with an option for Cognita Asia Holdings Pte. Ltd. to call for a further 20% of the shares held by Thai nationals. There can be no assurance either that the relevant Thai regulator will not challenge or find that the ownership structure violates current legislation or that the relevant regulations governing foreign ownership of schools in Thailand will not change in the future. If the ownership structure of our schools in Thailand is found to be non-compliant with current or future relevant regulations, we may be unable to operate our schools or we may have less control over our schools that are subject to such ownership structures. In addition, we may experience disputes with our nominees or ownership partners. As a result, our business related to these schools could be materially and adversely affected. Vietnam law allows up to 100% foreign ownership of an educational establishment. However, pursuant to Decree 86, which came into effect on August 1, 2018 foreign owned education institutions are subject to certain restrictions, including a 50% cap on intake of Vietnamese national students in kindergarten, primary and secondary schools, which are not applicable to non-foreign owned education institutions. International Education Corporation Joint Stock Company, which owns and operates the International School of Ho Chi Minh City (“ISHCMC”) and International School of Ho Chi Minh City American Academy (“AAVN”), is a foreign owned entity incorporated under the laws of Vietnam. ISHCMC and AAVN are owned and operated under a 40 year investment certificate which was granted in 1993, prior to the changes in Vietnam law, and have obtained a “Certificate of Operation Registration” that had allowed the schools to enroll Vietnamese national students in primary school and secondary school level without any cap on the total number of the Vietnamese national students. ISHCMC and AAVN voluntarily limit the number of Vietnamese students enrolled, however if we were to expand our operations to other schools in Vietnam which required a new investment certificate, International Education Corporation Joint Stock Company could become subject to Decree 86, which would impact our ability to enroll Vietnamese national students and may make ISHCMC and AAVN less competitive in the market. Lotus Education and Training One Member Company Limited, which owns and operates International School Saigon Pearl (“ISSP”), is owned by an entity incorporated under the laws of Vietnam. It is structured as a local entity without foreign ownership and therefore is not subject to the cap on intake of Vietnamese national students. There can be no assurance that the relevant regulator will not challenge our interpretation of the guidelines or that the regulator will not amend the guidelines such that Decree 86 may be deemed to apply to us.

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key nearterm priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. 45 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and senior to the Guarantees. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to the Guarantees.

In addition, on the Issue Date, the Term Loan B Facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility and our finance leases are, and the Indenture will permit future senior debt to be, secured by liens over property and assets that do not secure the Notes. Therefore, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the Term Loan B Facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility and future senior debt or obligations to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness (other than the Collateral). If the proceeds realized from the enforcement of Collateral exceed the amount owed under the Term Loan B Facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility and such other senior debt or obligations, any excess amount of such proceeds will be paid to the Trustee on behalf of itself and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes (as beneficiary of junior-priority interests, in the case of Collateral, and as an unsecured creditor, in the case of all other property and assets).

The fair market value of the security is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, our ability to implement our business strategy, the ability to sell the security in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of any security would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the security at such time, general, market and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of the sale. There also can be no assurance that the security will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of any liquidation or foreclosure is uncertain.

In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

In certain jurisdictions, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens or if it has been agreed that such perfection steps shall not be taken on the basis that such steps have undesirable effects. For the avoidance of doubt, the Security Agent will not have any obligation to take any steps or actions necessary to perfect any such liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor and there has occurred an event of default under the Indenture. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority. The Issuer and the Guarantors have limited obligations to assist the Security Agent in perfecting the security interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that the Issuer will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that should constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly create and perfect the security interest in such property and rights acquired post completion. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute Collateral or the creation or perfection of any security interest. The failure to create or perfect such additional security interests may adversely affect the relevant security interest and/or the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes. In the case of the laws of England and Wales, where the security is registerable, provided that such security is registered, then the ranking of security interests granted by security providers incorporated in England and Wales is, subject to certain exceptions, determined by the date on which they were created. Accordingly, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral which has been duly registered will take priority over an earlier created security interest which has not been registered within the appropriate timeframe. The ranking of certain other security interests is determined by the date of registration or, as applicable, the date of notice. 51 ----- In the case of Singapore law, where the security is registerable, provided that such security is registered (and, if necessary, stamp duty is paid in connection with the same), then the ranking of security interests granted by security providers incorporated in Singapore is, subject to certain exceptions, determined by the date on which they were created or in the case of registerable security over land, the date the mortgage is registered. Accordingly, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral which has been duly registered (and, if necessary, stamped) will take priority over an earlier created security interest which has not been registered within the appropriate timeframe.

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws, equitable principles and insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral against a Guarantor or security provider. Courts may also in certain circumstances avoid the Collateral or the Guarantees where the security provider is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In insolvency proceedings, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors, the security providers or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and Collateral, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Collateral provided by the Issuer or such Guarantor; - direct that the Issuer and/or the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any Security Document to the relevant Guarantor or to the respective security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or the security provider; and - take other action that is detrimental to holders of the Notes. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Collateral is found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure the holders of the Notes that we can ever repay 53 ----- in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee and the liability of each security provider will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from a Guarantor or a security provider under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or each security provider and whether a court would give effect to such attempted limitation. Also, there is a possibility that the entire guarantee or security may be set aside, in which case, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s entire liability may be extinguished. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of or to promote the success of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or Collateral was created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that we or a Guarantor were insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or a security provider was insolvent on the date the respective guarantee was issued or security was created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, transaction at undervalue, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, transaction at undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, transaction at undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. The payment of dividends or principal or interest on the Intercompany Loan to the Issuer or to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments or payments of principal and interest on the Intercompany Loan that reduce our distributable profits and reserves to zero. We intend to make dividends and enter into the Intercompany Loan and other intercompany loans to service indebtedness and for tax-planning purposes. We may not have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. In addition, the payment under the Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate 54 ----- formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our directors and executive officers located outside of the United States. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with England. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in England of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in England. In addition, the enforcement in England of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that an English court would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in England on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. See “Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.” The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Singapore. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Singapore of civil liability provisions based upon U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, the enforcement in Singapore of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based (whether in whole or in part) on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a Singapore court will enter judgments or grant remedies sought in an original action brought in Singapore based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign currency exchange gains or losses, if any.

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Local Facilities or other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such 55 ----- indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from the Restricted Group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources or the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement or other indebtedness. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to repay or refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon occurrence of a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture. To the extent such default is not cured or waived within the applicable grace period, such default may, subject to the provisions set out therein, result in a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding.

The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.

It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes.

Total Average Student Capacity and total average enrollment increased by 17.4% and 14.2%, respectively, between the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2018. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were £430.5 million and £80.3 million, respectively. Each Cognita school has its own unique ethos, with curricula and programs tailored to the needs of the students and parents in the market it serves. Our distinctive offerings are underpinned by our commitment to deliver on the three primary aspects of a Cognita education: high academic standards, strong character development and a global perspective. We offer a wide and diverse range of curricula across regions to appeal to both local and expatriate populations, including: the British curriculum, which is based on the standardized national curriculum for England and which, with respect to our Spain segment, is supplemented with the Spanish national curriculum; the International Baccalaureate (“IB”), a prestigious and rigorous internationally recognized diploma program; the American curriculum (American Education Reaches Out standard, Massachusetts state standards, the New York state standards and the Texas state standards); the Australian national curriculum; the Brazilian national curriculum and the Brazilian (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Brazilian national curriculum; and the Chilean national curriculum and the Chilean (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Chilean national curriculum. We believe that this multi-curriculum approach allows us to better serve a variety of attractive market segments while still preserving our academic and institutional standards. All of our schools have an English language offering. In addition, we believe that, throughout our organization, we benefit from our established reputation for providing academic excellence, high quality teachers and appealing school facilities. Our philosophy of providing an “Inspiring World of Education” lies at the core of each of our schools’ unique value proposition and sets the standards by which we operate and further develop our schools. We place 65 ----- significant emphasis on delivering individualized teaching and learning and providing exceptional student outcomes, irrespective of students’ individual abilities. The majority of our schools follow a non-selective admissions policy and we seek to support each student in achieving outcomes to the best of his or her ability through our commitment to high standards in all aspects of teaching, care and school management. We strengthen this approach by setting individualized learning goals which provide the right level of challenge and support for growing minds and by implementing processes for regularly tracking and benchmarking student attainment. We employ a systematic approach to student enrollment and retention across our platform and use our global scale and diverse expertise to build best practice in all our school. We operate in developed and developing markets and our success in increasing enrollment reflects the underlying strength and favorable dynamics of these markets. The developed and many of the developing markets in which we operate (such as Vietnam and Thailand) are characterized by stable market fundamentals, including a large middle class and a strong and established private school presence. Our success in the developing markets in which we operate is based, in part, on the sizeable pools of expatriate families in these markets, the increasing wealth among local families, each of whom value and demand high quality education for their children and the increasing demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours. Substantially all of our revenues are from private-pay sources without exposure to changes in government funding. Our operations are backed by a large and attractive portfolio of well-invested and well-maintained campuses and facilities. Our real estate portfolio comprises of 126 sites, of which 36 are owned on a freehold basis and the remaining 90 are leasehold properties on lease terms that we believe are favorable for our operations. The average remaining tenure with respect to our leasehold school properties is 23 years. The book value of our real estate portfolio at cost as at August 31, 2018 was £559.6 million.

Our revenue grew during the periods under review principally as a result of increased enrollment and fee increases above the rate of inflation due to our focus on quality and strong demand. We have grown our average student numbers through filling pre-existing capacity as well as through greenfield and expansion projects. During the periods under review, this growth resulted from (i) maturity of existing schools as senior grades start to fill, (ii) capacity expansion at existing schools (which reduces short term utilization and earnings but enhances longer term growth as schools fill over time), (iii) five acquisitions and two greenfield expansions, and (iv) a reduction in student churn due to heightened focus on student retention. Total enrollment in our schools has increased by a CAGR of 6.9% from 33,595 average FTE students as of August 31, 2016 to 38,379 average FTE students as of August 31, 2018. Of this increase in enrollments, 2,415 Average FTE Student Enrollments were as a result of acquisitions. For a discussion of our historical Average FTE Student Enrollment, see “—Key Operating Metrics—Enrollments.” Average Revenue per FTE Student has increased from approximately £9,900 for the year ended August 31, 2016 to £11,200 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 primarily due to fee increases above consumer price inflation and the impact of the portfolio mix of higher fee paying schools when considered on a Group basis, in particular, the change in mix toward premium education offerings in Asia, including the recently opened Stamford American School in Hong Kong.

During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the number of schools grew to 70, with the acquisitions of the American British School and Santo Tomas in Chile, the Woodland Pre-Schools in Hong Kong, along with the opening of the Stamford American School in Hong Kong. The Avondale school in Singapore was also merged with the Australian International School, Singapore during the year (and is now considered part of AIS for purposes of the number of operation schools). During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, the number of schools stayed at 67, with the acquisition of The English Montessori School in Spain and the Avondale school in Singapore being offset by the sale of the 70 ----- Sackville school in the UK and the merger of the International School of Barcelona, Sitges with the British School of Barcelona. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, the number of schools grew to 67. The closures of Chilton Cantelo and Cranbrook schools in the UK were offset by the acquisition of the International School of Barcelona in Spain and St. Andrews International School, Dusit in Thailand along with the opening of the Colegio Pumahue Chicauma in Chile. _Capacity_ We monitor our Average Student Capacity, which is the total number of students a particular school can accommodate at any given time. We increased our Average Student Capacity by 17.4%, from 43,155 average places in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 to 50,659 average places in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. This increase in capacity was primarily due to the acquisitions and openings of the schools described in “—Number of operational schools” above. Total Average Student Capacity increased by 13.3% in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. Of this increase, 8.1% was attributable to group expansion projects, most notably in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Brazil, while the remainder of the increase represented the net impact of acquisitions and divestments. Total Average Student Capacity increased by 3.6% in the year ended August 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016. The growth in capacity excluded the new Hong Kong school, which added a further 400 seats of capacity from September 2017, rising to 800 from January 2018. The growth is attributable to the acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 financial years, along with the opening of the Colegio Pumahue Chicauma in Chile and the new Hastings sites in Madrid Spain. _Enrollments_ We monitor the average number of FTE students for any given year in a particular Cohort. For example, one student in a school for half a year is 0.5 FTE, or one nursery student attending 50% of available sessions for a year is 0.5 FTE. The number of FTE students fluctuates throughout the academic year as existing students flow through to higher Cohorts from one year to the next, new students join at different Cohorts (both at the start of and during the academic year) as well as due to student churn (including students who leave school either to go to another school or expatriate churn). As part of monitoring our student numbers, we focus particular attention on the number of inquiries and applications by prospective families at each of our schools and the number of these that result in enrollments. In our experience, the ratios of inquiries to applications and of inquiries to enrollments are useful indicators in predicting the number of student enrollments. Thus, in our marketing and recruitment activities, we seek to maximize the generation of inquiries and the conversion of these into enrollments.

The staff number increased at a faster rate than students due to the opening of new facilities. Average FTE Student Enrollments throughout the Group grew by 5.0% and Average FTE Staff numbers grew by 4.7 % in the year ended August 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 financial years, ongoing growth in Chile from the increasing popularity of the bilingual program, along with strong growth in Spain following targeted development projects to increase capacity. _Average Revenue per FTE Student_ We calculate Average Revenue per FTE Student for a period by dividing the revenue from our schools for the period (including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018) by the 71 ----- average FTE students for the period. Average Revenue per FTE Student is primarily affected by the tuition fees we charge at each of our schools. Average Revenue per FTE Student, and therefore our revenue, is directly affected by our ability to increase tuition fees year on year at each of our schools. We believe expatriates and local families generally accept our price increases because of the importance they place on a quality education for their children. As a result, we seek to increase Average Revenue per FTE Student at our schools at a rate in excess of our cost inflation in the markets in which we operate. Our tuition fees are charged in the local currencies of the countries where the schools are located. Therefore, our Average Revenue per FTE Student is subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between these local currencies and our reported currency (which is partially offset by a natural hedge resulting from the fact that our school operating costs are largely in the relevant local currency). The geographical mix of our students also affects our results of operations. During the periods under review, we experienced higher student numbers in Chile (and to a lesser extent, Spain) where gross fees are lower than in other countries (reflecting local market dynamics).

Utilization should be analysed over time, as it is impacted by the opening of new sites and the expansion of existing sites, which adds capacity immediately but typically takes time to mature. Utilization has remained relatively flat during the periods under review, decreasing from 77.8% in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 to 75.8% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The small decrease was driven by the significant capacity expansion in the last two years, particularly in Asia. Utilization decreased by 3.2% to 75.8% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year due to the additional capacity opened in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Brazil. Utilization increased by 1.1% to 78.9% during the year ended August 31, 2017, due to increased enrollments to fill existing capacity. _FTE Staff_ We monitor Average FTE Staff for any given year at a school as well as the average number of Group central staff. Our total Average FTE Staff numbers have increased by 14.9%, from an average of 5,098 in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 to an average of 5,858 in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. This increase in Average FTE Staff has been primarily due to the acquisition of new schools, the opening of new facilities in Asia and Brazil and an increase in staffing at our existing schools in line with increased enrollments.

Asia student growth was mostly driven by the opening of Stamford American School, Hong Kong, the acquisition of Avondale Grammar School, Singapore, the opening of the ISHCMC secondary campus in Vietnam and strong organic growth in Vietnam. Growth in student numbers in Latin America reflected strong organic growth in Chile, supported by the success of the bilingual syllabus offered in five schools in Chile and the GayLussac expansion. _Operating Costs_ Underlying costs increased by 12.1% to £350.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from £312.3 million (£315.8 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) in the comparable period of 2017.

Much of this increase in Regional Adjusted EBITDA was derived from strong growth in Spain and Chile associated with the infill of capacity and the growth in the bilingual education programs in Chile. The decline in margin was due to the transitional impact of the lower utilization associated with the opening of new capacity, particularly in Asia. Group central costs decreased 4.1% to £10.5 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from £11.0 million in the comparable period of 2017 due to £0.8 million of central costs being reallocated into Regional Adjusted EBITDA. _Non-Underlying Costs_ Non-underlying operating expenses of £8.7 million in the fiscal year-ended August 31, 2018 included costs related to the Acquisition of £8.3 million along with a loss on disposal of £0.4 million, this compared to 75 ----- operating income of £0.3 million from a gain on disposal in the prior year. Restructuring costs of £0.9 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (compared to a £7.1 million expense in the comparable period of 2017) were due to a £2.9 million cost associated with restructuring programs, offset by the release of a provision relating to the transfer of students from Avondale Grammar School to the Australian International School in Singapore, which was no longer required. Non-underlying costs in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 also included acquisition and business exploration costs of £5.9 million (compared to £7.8 million in the comparable period of 2017), reflecting costs related to acquisitions completed in the period and £1.0 million of pre-opening losses relating to unopened sites. There were also non-cash share-based payment charges of £14.8 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to £0.2 million in the comparable period of 2017. _Finance Income_ Finance income decreased by £4.3 million to £5.1 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from £9.4 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to £7.3 million of exchange gains on intercompany loans in the year ended August 31, 2017, being an exchange loss in the current year (therefore recorded in finance expense), this decrease was offset by £4.2 million of derivative gains in the year ended August 31, 2018. _Finance Expense_ Finance expense decreased by £3.0 million to £47.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from £50.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower expense associated with a £15.2 million derivative loss recorded in the year ended August 31, 2017, offset by £7.0 million of higher interest payable on bank borrowings associated with increasing debt levels and £7.4 million exchange losses on intercompany loans in the current year. _Profit/Loss for the Period Before Taxation_ The Group’s loss before tax was £56.5 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to a loss of £17.8 million in the comparable period of 2017. The loss was primarily driven by a £16.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization and a £12.8 million increase in impairment charges, partly offset by a £7.4 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. _Taxation_ The Group’s tax charge increased by 6.4% to £6.8 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from £6.4 million in the comparable period of 2017.

Asia student growth was mostly driven by the Dusit acquisition in Thailand in 2016 and continued growth in Stamford American International School in Singapore and ISHCMC in Vietnam. The growth of 5.3% in Latin America was largely due to the ongoing growth in the Chile schools with new capacity and the bilingual program continuing to drive enrollment increases. _Operating Costs_ Underlying costs increased 17.5% to £312.3 million (£315.8 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2017 from £265.8 million (£269.5 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2016.

The EBITDA in Spain was impacted by new costs from two additional sites in Madrid for Hastings school, which we expect to drive growth in future years. Group central costs increased by 12.4% to £11.0 million in the year ended August 31, 2017 from £9.8 million in the year ended August 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the full year impact following the transition of our executive management team. _Non-Underlying Costs_ Non-underlying costs for the year ended August 31, 2017 included one-off charges for non-cash impairments of £2.6 million compared to £8.2 million for the year ended August 31, 2016, acquisition and business exploration costs of £7.8 million (compared to £4.6 million for the year ended August 31, 2016) restructuring costs of £7.1 million (compared to £7.1 million for the year ended August 31, 2016) and non-cash share based charges of £0.2 million (compared to £4.0 million for the year ended August 31, 2016). The impairment charge arose due to a reduction in the carrying value of fixed assets for two of the Group’s UK schools following an impairment review in accordance with the Group accounting policy. The acquisition and business exploration costs were higher in the year ended August 31, 2017 due to the increase in M&A activity during the year. The restructuring costs in the year ended August 31, 2017 included the costs associated with the sale of Sackville School and the restructuring costs of closing the Avondale Grammar School property and moving the students to the Australian International School, Singapore. _Finance Income_ Finance income decreased from £29.5 million in the year ended August 31, 2016 to £9.4 million in the year ended August 31, 2017, primarily associated with the lower exchange gains realized on intercompany loans between Cognita Holdings Limited and subsidiaries. The intercompany loans were put in place to enable funding to be passed into the Cognita Group from Cognita Financing plc (the issuer under the Existing Notes). _Finance Expense_ Finance expense decreased by 31.7% to £50.2 million in the year ended August 31, 2017 from £73.5 million in the year ended August 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by the lower fair value losses on foreign exchange hedge instruments of £28.8 million partly offset by £4.8 million higher interest costs from the Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. _Profit/Loss for the Year Before Taxation_ The Group’s loss before tax decreased by 45.8% to £17.8 million for the year ended August 31, 2017 from £32.9 million in the year ended August 31, 2016. The £15.1 million decrease in losses was primarily driven by the £12.7 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA generated from organic and acquisitive growth, a £6.3 million decrease in non-underlying costs driven by a smaller impairment charge and lower net finance expense partly offset by £6.4 million of additional depreciation and amortization in the year ended August 31, 2017. _Taxation_ The Group’s tax charge decreased by 4.5% to £6.4 million in the year ended August 31, 2017 from £6.7 million in the year ended August 31, 2016. This was primarily due to an over-provision of current tax of £0.4 million in Singapore in the prior year.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

As a result of the reallocation, cash flows relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment decreased by £2.5 million and cash flows relating to movements in trade and other payables increased by the same amount. There was no impact on the net increase in cash and cash equivalents. The principal factors affecting our net cash inflows from operating activities in the periods presented are the operating results of the Group along with the positive impact of changes in our working capital. Our business benefits from structurally negative working capital, as fees are generally paid in advance of the provision of services, with the highest cash inflow occurring prior to the commencement of the relevant academic year. Our working capital cycles are also influenced by the geographical markets in which we operate. School billing cycles differ from one jurisdiction to another and these billing cycles impact the negative working capital position of the Group. Our working capital has become increasingly negative over time due to our growing FTE student numbers and because of an increase in the proportion of Group revenue generated by our schools in Asia that generally invoice further in advance compared to our other regions. Our net working capital was £147.0 million as of August 31, 2016, £189.1 million as of August 31, 2017 and £190.2 million as of August 31, 2018. The higher negative working capital at August 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was principally due to £24.2 million of additional capital expenditures accrued in connection with the large development projects concluding in Singapore, along with a £16.7 million increase in prepaid tuition fees. The higher negative working capital as of August 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a growth of £8.0 million in prepaid tuition and £6.5 million of transaction fees relating to the Acquisition being accrued as at August 31, 2018, this has been largely offset by £18.8 million unwinding of capital expenditure accruals as of August 31, 2017 relating to the completion of the Early Learning Village in Singapore and the Stamford International School Hong Kong development. Our operating cash outflows are also cyclical, but they do not necessarily track the seasonality of our billing cycles. For example, we typically schedule maintenance of our facilities between academic years or school terms, and this has an adverse effect on our working capital during such periods. A significant proportion of our operating capital expenditure occurs in July and August of each year due to the fact that most of our schools in the Europe and Asia have extended vacation periods during these months and we can therefore undertake projects without disrupting the relevant schools during this time.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Attending schools that teach in English better prepares children for post-secondary education at universities that teach primarily in English. We believe parents increasingly emphasize the pursuit of education in highly ranked universities, many of which are located in English-speaking countries, as a path to a successful career. Obtaining quality primary and secondary education in English enhances the likelihood of admission to, and success, at these top universities. The growing demand for English language proficiency translates directly into increasing demand for private-pay K-12 international and bilingual schools, where English is used extensively as the medium of instruction by native English-speaking teachers. The English language learning environment distinguishes these schools from other alternatives. In addition to providing greater educational opportunities, we believe that proficiency in English provides students with broader professional opportunities, particularly in English-speaking countries or in countries where English is widely spoken, which provides the potential for higher earnings. _Strong Academic and Career Outcomes_ Private-pay K-12 operators aim to provide an educational experience that tends to focus on stronger academic outcomes relative to public school alternatives. Strong academics are among the highest ranked factors that parents and students consider when choosing schools. Since most international private-pay K-12 schools focus on internationally recognisable curricula, this focus drives demand from both local and expatriate students. For example, for local students, curriculum preference tends to be driven by location of university aspirations abroad. Similarly, for expatriates, the right curriculum options are critical for parents to ensure consistency of education for their child, as well as portability of credits and ease of transfers to the next school. _Local Student Population_ Across both developed and emerging markets, the local student population demand for private-pay K-12 education has seen consistent growth. For example, in many of our catchment markets, like Barcelona, Spain where demand for English- and Spanish-based curricula exists, local students make up approximately 40% of the student population in English based schools and 75% of the student population in Spanish based schools. Further, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, approximately 93% of the student population is local. Similar trends are present in Asia and the United Kingdom. Similarly, local students in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, make up over 70% of the student population within the international and bilingual K-12 market segments. This growth has been driven by several structural factors: _Increases in Household Disposable Incomes_ Increases in household disposable income (especially in emerging markets) make private education more affordable for an increasing number of families. In management’s experience, many of the markets in which we operate have experienced significant growth in household disposable incomes. _Greater Parental Aspirations_ In general, parents strive to provide the best possible educational opportunities for their children. In emerging markets, with growing disposable income, parents realize the link between education and further advancement and prioritize the education of their children accordingly. _Expatriate Student Population A Growing Global Expatriate Population_ Globalization has led to increasing FDI and an increasing number of expatriates. Studies indicate that expatriates prioritize quality and continuity of education for their children, and seek schools that provide similar curricula and academic standards as schools in their home country. We believe that an increasingly global and connected economy coupled with continued FDI growth will drive continued demand for premium international K-12 education options. _Employer Support for Education Spend_ To facilitate and encourage international assignments, employers of expatriates often reimburse parents for tuition fees, make direct payment of fees to educational institutions or provide lump sum payments that parents use to pay tuition, further supporting demand for quality private-pay K-12 education options. 87 ----- _Government Support for International Education_ In our end markets, governments have generally been supportive of and have encouraged the expansion of private educational options. Governments support private education with international curricula, in part, because high-quality international education supports expatriate families and FDI growth.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Parents looking for a high quality education, especially one that offers international curricula, tend to focus on private-pay opportunities for their children. As a result, parents who can afford private education generally turn to that alternative across both developed and developing markets. _Limited Investment in Capacity_ Investment in new or expanded capacity at public and single-operated private-pay K-12 schools in most of the countries in which we operate has not kept pace with the increasing demand for quality education. In our end markets, the majority of government funding is spent on teacher salaries, other current expenses, and maintenance capital expenditures, with limited remaining funding available for capacity expansion. Most single-school private-pay K-12 operators are resource constrained in terms of management’s ability to expand capacity. Consequently, historically, many of these operators have not increased capacity even when demand in their markets has exceeded supply, creating significant and attractive opportunities for multi-school operators to expand capacity and deliver high-quality education and school options. Additionally, when governments or regulators, such as in Singapore, plan capacity expansion for private-pay K-12 international curriculum education, they generally expect operators to have a strong reputation and to be able to demonstrate their scale and ability to finance such expansion as well as to have a proven track record of meeting demand for private-pay K-12 international curriculum education.

Barriers generally include: - Lead time required to build brand recognition and reputation, both on a local and global basis: due to the intimate nature of education and its impact on lifelong trajectory, parents carefully consider the reputation of schools for their children and tend to choose established schools; - Challenges faced by inexperienced operators in securing government licenses and regulatory approval in many jurisdictions; and - Scarcity of real estate (especially in urban centres) in commercially viable areas that can accommodate a sizeable campus with comprehensive high-quality facilities and the importance of a deep understanding of the local real estate markets including relevant catchment dynamics and land acquisition process.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

School tuition is considered by parents as “non-discretionary” spending. This visibility is further enhanced by competition among students to gain a spot in prestigious private-pay K-12 institutions.

Each Cognita school has its own unique ethos, with curricula and programs tailored to the needs of the students and parents in the market it serves. Our distinctive offerings are underpinned by our commitment to deliver on the three primary aspects of a Cognita education: high academic standards, strong character development and a global perspective. We offer a wide and diverse range of curricula across regions to appeal to both local and expatriate populations, including: the British curriculum, which is based on the standardized national curriculum for England and which, with respect to our Spain segment, is supplemented with the Spanish national curriculum; the International Baccalaureate (“IB”), a prestigious and rigorous internationally recognized diploma program; the American curriculum (American Education Reaches Out standard, Massachusetts state standards, the New York state standards and the Texas state standards); the Australian national curriculum; the Brazilian national curriculum and the Brazilian (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Brazilian national curriculum; and the Chilean national curriculum and the Chilean (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Chilean national curriculum. We believe that this multi-curriculum approach allows us to better serve a variety of attractive market segments while still preserving our academic and institutional standards. All of our schools have an English language offering. In addition, we believe that, throughout our organization, we benefit from our established reputation for providing academic excellence, high quality teachers and appealing school facilities. Our philosophy of providing an “Inspiring World of Education” lies at the core of each of our schools’ unique value proposition and sets the standards by which we operate and further develop our schools. We place significant emphasis on delivering individualized teaching and learning and providing exceptional student outcomes, irrespective of students’ individual abilities. The majority of our schools follow a non-selective admissions policy and we seek to support each student in achieving outcomes to the best of his or her ability through our commitment to high standards in all aspects of teaching, care and school management. We strengthen this approach by setting individualized learning goals which provide the right level of challenge and support for growing minds and by implementing processes for regularly tracking and benchmarking student attainment. We employ a systematic approach to student enrollment and retention across our platform and use our global scale and diverse expertise to build best practice in all our school. We operate in developed and developing markets and our success in increasing enrollment reflects the underlying strength and favorable dynamics of these markets. The developed and many of the developing markets in which we operate (such as Vietnam and Thailand) are characterized by stable market fundamentals, including a large middle class and a strong and established private school presence. Our success in the developing markets in which we operate is based, in part, on the sizeable pools of expatriate families in these markets, the increasing wealth among local families, each of whom value and demand high quality education for their children and the increasing demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours.

Our real estate portfolio comprises of 126 sites, of which 36 are owned on a freehold basis and the remaining 90 are leasehold properties on lease terms that we believe are favorable for our operations.

Although we operate globally, our operations have a strategic focus on high value, growing, gateway markets such as: Singapore, Ho Chi Minh 95 ----- City (“HCMC”), Hong Kong, Bangkok, Madrid, Barcelona and London. According to the Market Report, between academic years 2015-2018 (except for Hong Kong, which is measured from academic year 2014-2018), Pre-K-12 revenue in these attractive segments grew at an annual CAGR as follows: Singapore (6%); HCMC (14%); Hong Kong (10%); Bangkok (includes the Eastern Seaboard region) (8%); Madrid (7%); Barcelona (11%) and London (6%). With existing facilities and experience in each of these gateway cities, we consider ourselves well positioned to capture some of this market growth. Revenue growth in the market is underpinned by high growth in private school enrollments compared to public enrollments. According to UNESCO, in Europe there were approximately 16 million private K-12 students in 2016 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 8% from 2011 to 2017, in Latin America (including the Caribbean) there were approximately 25 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 1% from 2011 to 2017 and in Asia (including Central, Southern, Eastern and Southeast regions) there were approximately 198 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 3% from 2011 to 2017. Research by Euromonitor and Oxford Economics suggests that the relevant school going population for the private K-12 market (aged 3-17 year olds) grew by a CAGR of 0.9% across our key European and Asian markets from 10.6 million in 2015 to 10.9 million in 2018 and is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 0.9%, reaching 11.4 million by 2023. Demand for our schools is driven by both local and expatriate demand. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we had approximately 75% of local students and 25% of expatriate students. The exact percentage of expatriate students varies significantly country-by-country. Our schools in Hong Kong and Vietnam rely on approximately 49% and 58% expatriate students, respectively, whereas our schools in Chile and Brazil entirely rely on local demand. _Local Demand_ The developing markets, in which our schools target local families, have seen both strong parental aspirations not met by public education and an increase in household disposable income in recent years, which has made private education both more affordable and more desirable for an increasing number of families. Furthermore, we believe that demand for private education in these regions is supported by the importance that parents and students living in non-English speaking countries place on English language fluency, which, in turn, supports demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours, most of which have an English-language offering. Additionally, there is an increasing desire among parents for their children to study abroad at foreign universities. This in turn drives demand for private-pay K-12 schools, such as ours, that are perceived to have a strong record of student placements to reputed higher education institutions. Many of our schools offer college counseling and pre-university programs. We believe that these increases in disposable income, combined with the demand for high quality education, are key drivers of growth in student enrollment in private-pay K-12 schools in these markets. _Expatriate Demand_ The international markets in which we serve expatriate families, including Singapore, HCMC, Hong Kong, Bangkok, London, Barcelona and Madrid are located in countries that have experienced strong GDP growth, with an associated increase in expatriate populations who, we believe, prioritize quality and continuity of education for their children and seek schools that provide a similar curriculum and academic standards as schools in their home countries. The following table shows the annual growth in GDP between 2015 and 2018 and the estimated annual growth in GDP between 2018 and 2023 in our key regions, according to the IMF: **2015-2018** **2018-2023** Singapore . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 3% Vietnam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7% 7% Hong Kong . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 3% Thailand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4% 4% UK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2% 2% Spain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 2% 96 ----- The following table shows enrollment growth between the academic year 2015 and 2018 (except for Hong Kong, which is measured from academic year 2014-2018) and the estimated enrollment between 2018 and 2023 in our key expatriate cities, according to the Market Report: **2015-2018** **2018-2023** Singapore . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% 3% HCMC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9% 7% Hong Kong . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5% 4% Bangkok[(1)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4% 3% London . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2% 2% Barcelona . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6% 5% Madrid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4% 2% Note: (10) Includes the Eastern Seaboard region.

In February 2017, we established an Education Advisory Board (“EAB”) to drive outstanding educational practices across the Group and focus on evidence to improve academic outcomes. The EAB chaired by Sir Kevan Collins, who is currently the Chief Executive of the Education Endowment Foundation (an independent charity organization dedicated to the improvement of the educational attainment of underprivileged students in English schools). The EAB’s mission is to accelerate academic improvement, build teacher capacity, share effective best practices and establish external partnerships. We have developed the “Cognita Way,” which is a framework we use to drive improvements at our schools and maintain the high level of education valued by Parents through: - _Energized Leadership: We believe that a key to driving improvement and academic success for our students is the academic vision of our Head Teachers. As such, we have a careful recruitment process for our school Head Teachers. Once Head Teachers are hired, we endeavor to ensure stability over time by investing in our leaders to inspire and share best practices they develop. - _Personalized Learning: We focus on high quality learning in each classroom and on providing the right level of challenge and support for each student and we underpin this approach with data and predictive tools to track student progress, benchmark individual student attainment and allow us to make informed decisions based on the student’s particular situation. - _People Growth: We view employing skilled and well-educated teachers at all of our schools as an important driver of the success of our product offering, and we have a professional and diligent approach to recruitment and selection, with tailored practices specific to each region. We also invest in the professional development of our teachers to help them to enhance their skills as well as to maintain high motivation 99 ----- levels, for example, by providing career advancement prospects and the opportunity for teachers with high potential to complete Masters programs in education. By operating as a global group, we also provide internal opportunities to our teachers such as workplace shadowing and secondments, which may not be available with single school operators. In addition, our global platform and Group central and regional management teams free up school management and teachers from dealing with commercial and administrative matters so that they have more time to focus on high quality teaching and learning. - _Community: We actively seek to listen to and engage with the key people in each school community. We run a consistent system for gathering feedback across all regions through engagement with students (Voice of Students, VoS), parents (Voice of Parents, VoP) and employees (Voice of Employees, VoE) and utilization of CSAT tools such as Confirmit. Additionally, we work with a range of associations and accreditation bodies and school inspectorates and engage with the global education sector through participation in debates and conferences and partnerships with leading independent schools. - _Innovation: We strive to maintain innovative curricula at our schools and constantly seek to implement new learning solutions and programs, both in the classroom, such as our full bilingual and English as an Additional Language (EAL) programs, and outside of the classroom, such as our outdoor learning and leadership development programs through our ALG division. - _Brilliant Basics: We have developed systems and best-practices that are applied across our network to ensure that all of our schools are run according to the highest standards of safeguarding and health and safety, allowing us to maintain accreditation and comply with local regulatory frameworks to help streamline the operation of our schools. We have also implemented a global finance system and we are in the process of implementing global solutions for HR, admissions and marketing. - _International accreditations: We have received accreditations from the leading international educational organizations, such as Cambridge Assessment International Education, Council of International Schools, COBIS, IB World School and NEASC. We are an outward looking organization, looking to learn from best practices globally. Our continued focus on high quality education has enabled our schools to achieve examination outcomes which are generally well above the relevant national, regional or global averages for each curriculum despite the fact that the majority of our schools are non-selective, for example: - Over the past three years, our British curriculum schools in the United Kingdom and Spain consistently achieved GCSE outcomes (in Math and English) significantly above the United Kingdom national average. - Over the past five years, students at our IB curriculum schools achieved outcomes ahead of the “world average” despite being non-selective schools, whilst the IB curriculum is, in many cases, offered by selective schools. - The Australian International School consistently achieves well on the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (“ATAR”) when compared to New South Wales. In 2017, the school had a mean ATAR score of 75.3 compared to a mean ATAR score of 70.0 for New South Wales. Additionally, 48% of AIS students gained an ATAR score over 80 points. - Over the past 10 years, our schools in Chile and Brazil have achieved PSU results (the standardized university examination used in Chile) and ENEM results (the standardized university examination used in Brazil) well above the respective national averages. 100 ----- The following charts highlight our schools’ superior academic performance as compared to national and world averages for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 with respect to the UK, Chile, Brazil and Australia and for the last five fiscal years with respect to our IB program:",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Additionally, centralized expertise and local knowledge helps us address the issue of the scarcity of real estate in key markets and the tendency of property developers and landlords to prefer operators with a strong track record and financial resources. Our long and positive track record and established reputation underpins our ability to recruit and retain high quality teachers, particularly in expatriate markets.

Some of our schools, such as Quinton House, offer over 100 different activities each week, ranging from sports to creative and performing arts to foreign languages and community services. Many of our schools also offer before and after school care, sport, music and arts and challenge programs, such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award, which promotes personal development through a range of community service initiatives and fitness activities. We believe that our global platform differentiates our schools through offerings, such as inter-school sports and musical events, as well as academic student exchange programs. For example, we operate an exchange program that enables students from our schools in Chile and Brazil to study for short periods of time at our schools in the United Kingdom. As part of this program visiting students are fully integrated in both classroom study and boarding accommodation, which allows them to improve their command of the English language and experience British culture. Our schools also provide activities and services that seek to encourage greater parental involvement, with teachers placing a strong emphasis on positive interactions with parents. For example, our schools in Spain offer a “Saturday Family Club,” which provides a range of activities for parents and students together. Furthermore, we use technology to enhance student learning and support pedagogical innovations. For example, Stamford American International School provides tablets to every student in its primary grades and laptops for every student in its secondary grades.

We added nearly 5,000 seats in premium markets over the past year. Our growth has been thoughtful and has been driven by targeted development (through acquisitions, greenfields and expansions), based on data and insights, which has complemented embedded growth stemming from our ability to drive enrollments and fill available capacity at our existing schools. Our track-record of acquisitions, greenfield projects and expansions has demonstrated our ability to create and fill new additional capacity. For example, enrollments grew at the Stamford American International School in Singapore (our first greenfield development) from approximately 109 students in fiscal year 2010 to approximately 2,900 students in fiscal year 2017. Likewise, following our acquisition of the British School of Barcelona, enrollments grew by 84% during the same period. Successfully implemented transactions such as these, where we preserve and enhance the quality of the acquired school in addition to growing enrollment, have further demonstrated our ability to transact in many markets and have made us a buyer-of-choice for family and trusts. Our data driven approach has resulted in us developing a proprietary pipeline of opportunities curated over more than 10 years. We intend to continue to evaluate both strategic expansion, acquisition and greenfield opportunities to develop capacity in markets in which we have experience or which we have identified as attractive based on rigorous analysis of the relevant market dynamics. We have identified a number of additional capacity expansion opportunities in certain regions. For example, we are in the process of developing the ELIS school in Murcia, Spain and we are embarking on the second phase of expansion at the Stamford American school in Hong Kong.

By the end of the 2008 fiscal year, we had expanded and diversified our operations to a total of 46 schools, including the acquisition of four international curriculum schools, including Southbank International School in 103 ----- London and the Australian International School in Singapore. In addition, during this year we also embarked on our first greenfield project to build the Stamford American International School in Singapore. In October 2009, we expanded our portfolio into Thailand through the acquisition of an 80% interest in BEMS, through which we operate three St. Andrews schools. In May 2011, we acquired an 80% interest in International Education Corporation Joint Stock Company (Vietnam), which operates ISHCMC and AAVN and which is controlled by a third-party nominee who has assigned his rights to us under a deed of assignment. In September 2011, we acquired the Royal School Hampstead in the United Kingdom which we later incorporated into the North Bridge House group of schools. In October 2012, we expanded into Latin America with the acquisition of Playpen in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in June 2013 we acquired a majority interest in a Chilean school group consisting of nine schools in Santiago, Colina, Valparaiso, Puerto Montt and Temuco (the “Chile Schools Business”). In August 2013, our third-party nominee acquired the remaining 20% minority interest in International Education Corporation Joint Stock Company (Vietnam), such that we effectively control 100% of our Vietnam schools through the nominee structure. We acquired a 75% interest in the International School Saigon Pearl in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in January 2014 and we acquired the remaining 25% interest in August 2014. In December 2014, we acquired the GayLussac School in Niteroi, Brazil. In addition to the new acquisitions, in September 2014 we opened the North Bridge House Senior School and Sixth Form—Canonbury in London, enhancing the offering provided by the North Bridge House group of schools. In February 2015, we acquired the remaining 20% minority interest in BEMS. In 2016, we acquired three additional schools: the International School of Barcelona in Sitges, Spain, which was merged into our British School of Barcelona, The English Montessori School in Madrid, Spain and Dusit, our fourth school in Bangkok, Thailand. In addition to the new acquisitions, we also opened Chicauma, a new school in Santiago, Chile, which teaches a Chilean national curriculum. In 2017, we acquired the Avondale Grammar School in Singapore, which later merged into our Australian International School. We also opened the Stamford American School, our first school in Hong Kong, and a new Early Learning Village (for students up to 6 years old) which provides separately branded facilities for the Australian International School and Stamford American International school in Singapore. In May 2017, we acquired the Bushcraft Company, which provides outdoor adventure trips for students aged 7 to 18 into woodland environments for practical and teambuilding experiences. We subsequently merged the Bushcraft business into our Super Camps business to form the Active Learning Group (“ALG”). In 2018, we acquired the American British School in Santiago, our eleventh school in Chile, and Woodland Pre-Schools in Hong Kong. On August 31, 2018 we acquired Santo Tomas adding a further school in Santiago, Chile. Finally, on November 6, 2018, we acquired Colegio Europeo de Madrid (“CEM”) in Madrid, Spain. In addition, we may acquire additional schools in the future which would impact our results of operations going forward. Between 2011 and 2012, we merged two of our schools with other existing schools and sold the freehold properties left vacant following these mergers. Furthermore, we transferred Ffynone House School in April 2012 and Ferndale Preparatory School in April 2014 to parent groups.

The majority of our schools are operated under an individual brand name, with some schools operating a number of campuses under the same brand name. We also operate a mix of local and international schools covering various curricula. As of August 31, 2018, we operated 54 predominantly local curriculum schools and 17 predominantly international curriculum schools, however, some of our schools offer dual curricula. Our students include local and expatriate students and tuition fees are typically paid by local and expatriate parents and, to a lesser extent, by employers of expatriate parents. We believe that our ability to deliver quality education is supported by operational excellence underpinned by our global platform. Day to day operations in our schools are supervised by an academic leader of the school (the “Head”) and a senior leadership team. Each local school management team oversees the provision of education and is responsible for delivering education in line with our mission of providing an “Inspiring World of Education.” In order to enable local school management teams to focus on educational quality, we have 104 ----- centralized certain core functions, such as property and facilities management, information technology systems and finance functions. Each centralized team oversees these functions on a regional and/or global basis. This centralized approach also enables us to deploy our resources and capital to achieve the best outcomes for our business by making operational and investment decisions based on areas where we are mostly likely to derive benefits and maximize our returns. See “—Centralized Functions.” In addition to our schools, we also operate holiday activity camps for children and other extra-curricular and outdoor activities through our ALG and Camp Asia divisions. We operate holiday activity camps in the United Kingdom, and in various other locations. Our camps are primarily intended for children aged four to 15 and include students from within our own schools as well as the wider community. We provide a range of sports and other activities as well as supervision for children attending our camps during the summer holiday vacation period. For the purposes of carrying out its activities, ALG uses both existing Cognita schools as well as other schools’ sites. Following the acquisition of the Bushcraft Company in 2017, we also provide outdoor adventure trips for students aged 7 to 18 into woodland environments for practical and teambuilding experiences through our ALG division. In Singapore, we established Camp Asia in the summer of 2012 at Stamford American International School and it has now grown to operate from both of our schools in Singapore and is the largest camps provider in Singapore. We use our holiday activity camps and outdoor adventure trips to attract prospective students to our schools. Furthermore, the operation of these holiday activity camps on school premises during school vacation periods enables us to optimize the use of our facilities.

We use a number of innovative, nationally recognized and accredited testing systems (such as MAP, GL and CEM Durham) for various age groups to establish a baseline for anticipated performance. This baseline is then benchmarked against data from other schools with students in an equivalent grade and serves as a basis for measuring value added progress.

Strong academic performance contributes to improved parent satisfaction, student retention and builds school reputation, which in turn supports continued enrollment and fee generation. In particular, we assess and track multiple aspects of parent satisfaction, the results of which inform our decision-making process. For example, we measure and track parent satisfaction with respect to teaching and learning, extra-curricular activities, communication, services and amenities and management of the school. We use professionally designed and administered surveys in order to gather comprehensive feedback from parents. This data is then used to guide school improvements and to provide quantitative data to support school governance and allocation of resources. Our continued focus on excellence has enabled our schools to achieve examination outcomes which are generally well above the relevant national, regional or global averages for each curriculum, even though we operate non-selective schools, for example: - Over the past three years, our British curriculum schools in our Europe segment consistently achieved GCSE (math and English) outcomes significantly above the United Kingdom national average. In 2018, 94% of all graded awarded at GCSE were G4+ compared to 69% nationally. The newly reformed qualification introduced Grade 9 as even higher than the previous A*. In 2018, we had 10% of students awarded at this level compared to 4% nationally. - Over the past five years, students at our IB curriculum schools achieved outcomes ahead of the “world points average” despite being non-selective schools (whilst the IB curriculum is, in many cases, offered by selective schools). In 2018, Southbank International School, St. Andrews International School, ISHCMC and Stamford American School had average points scores of 37.6, 34.7, 33.5 and 32.3, respectively, compared to the world points average of 29.8. - The Australian International School consistently achieves well on the ATAR when compared to New South Wales. In 2017, the school had a mean ATAR score of 75.3 compared to a mean ATAR score of 70.0 for New South Wales. Additionally, 46% of AIS students gained an ATAR score over 80 points. - Over the past three years, our schools in Chile and Brazil have achieved PSU results (the standardized university examination used in Chile) and ENEM results (the standardized university examination used in Brazil) well above the respective national averages.

Depending on the local market, such packages may include housing allowances and other benefits, such as healthcare and pensions. Our teachers and other staff are appropriately trained and qualified for their relevant positions. We invest substantial resources into the professional development of our teachers to continually enhance their skills. Our teachers are required to comply with the relevant continuing education requirements in each local market. For example, teachers in certain jurisdictions are required to complete on-going professional training programs in the form of classroom based training and other development activities to help them to keep abreast of curriculum changes. We offer a program to enable selected teachers to complete a post graduate certificate in education as well as a master of education program in the United Kingdom, Spain and certain countries in Asia for current and aspiring leaders. We also host professional development conferences for leaders, business managers and admissions personnel regularly throughout the academic year. We have developed our own policy for safer recruitment. This policy applies to the recruitment and selection of all of our staff, including non-employees. The policy provides guidelines regarding background checks on prospective teachers and other staff in their country of origin and any country in which they have lived or worked for at least three months since the age of 16. In the United Kingdom, we follow the U.K. Guidance from the Department for Education safer recruitment guidelines, the Independent Schools Inspectorate Handbook for the Inspection of Schools (2014), which ensures consistent and compliant recruitment in the United Kingdom education sector. In Asia, we apply the United Kingdom standards and also conduct additional non-mandatory compliance procedures, such as background checks on new teachers where possible. Additionally, in Asia, we use Control Risks, an external risk consultancy firm, to perform international integrity and background checks on prospective Heads and candidates for key executive roles where such persons have worked in two or more countries. In Latin America, we conduct background checks on new teachers and are in the process of expanding these to overseas checks as part of our own policy for safer recruitment.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

We further evaluate shortlisted markets to ensure that other considerations such as cost structure, macroeconomic conditions and related risks are reflected in our risk-return analysis. Once we have identified an attractive market, we undertake a detailed analysis of catchment dynamics to evaluate market potential. Analysis of a catchment involves estimating affordability and concentration of the customer base, which is an important factor in determining if there are a sufficient number of parents within driving distance of a potential school who have the requisite income levels to support our desired pricing models. In addition, we analyze competitors within the catchment and frequently conduct parent surveys to understand the optimum market positioning and educational offering for the area. While the nature of the analysis varies based upon the type of opportunity being evaluated, we apply our selection process rigorously across all opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.96,Investment Opportunities,17.96.2,Capacity Expansion at Existing Schools,"We consider schools for expansion only if there is strong underlying unmet demand, if our existing school has high current utilization rates and the school has an established reputation in the catchment area. Investments in expansions at existing schools often yield strong returns within a shorter period than greenfield developments or new acquisitions since much of the necessary academic and central resources are already in place. Expansions of capacity in our existing schools are only possible where we have land available to undertake an expansion of the existing facility. Therefore, the potential for future expansions are often considered at the time 111 ----- of acquiring or developing a new school. When acquiring or building a school, we undertake a detailed and rigorous assessment that includes market analysis to ascertain existing and projected supply and demand trends at a catchment level and options to obtain land that is optimally located and allows flexibility for expansion over time. The planning regulatory framework is also taken into consideration. The costs involved in expanding the capacity of an existing school primarily relate to development costs. We have continued to expand in Singapore to meet high demand. In 2017, we opened a dedicated Early Learning Village in Singapore, focused on infant care and Pre-K education. This expansion of the existing facilities shared by the Stamford American International School and the Australian International School includes state of the art facilities and provides over 2,100 additional places (increasing existing combined capacity at the two schools to over 8,600). We believe this is an attractive expansion opportunity where we can leverage our local market knowledge and experience, development expertise and the reputation of our current Singapore schools, in a market where the supply of private-pay education for expatriate families is limited by land constraints and the need for regulatory approvals. In January 2018, we opened a new secondary campus (grades 6-12) for the International School of Ho Chi Minh City (“ISHCMC”) in Vietnam. This added 900 additional seats (bringing total capacity to 1,950) in one of our most high growth markets at one of the most prestigious schools in Ho Chi Minh City, which had been capacity constrained for some years (104% Utilization in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017). Strong demand in our Latin America segment has also driven expansions in the region. In 2018, we completed the expansion of the GayLussac school in Niteroi, Brazil. The project provided enhanced facilities and created incremental capacity of approximately 260 students (bringing total capacity to 1,700). In the United Kingdom, we recently opened a new site for our Southbank International School, the most reputed IB school in London, which has increased capacity by approximately 280 students (to 1,090) and includes a new pre-university program, new facilities for the music department and specialist teaching and tutorial rooms. Finally, in Spain, in April 2018, we completed a new pre-university center for the British School of Barcelona which operates from nursery to year 13 and offers the British and IB curriculum, further increasing capacity by approximately 400 students (to 2,200).",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Our acquisition teams work with the regional management teams who bring a deep understanding of their local market and provide insight into cultural or regional variations. During the closing stages of an acquisition, we set up an integration team to begin the process of early engagement with the target school across all key functions. The level of engagement and timelines in connection with integration activity vary according to the size and complexity of the acquired schools. Our integration processes are structured to minimize operational disruptions at the acquired school. Upon acquiring a new school, we implement our operational and strategic programs to improve educational outcomes, student and parent satisfaction and operational and financial efficiency. For example, certain management responsibilities with respect to IT, finance, facilities management and real estate may be transferred to our regional and group teams, while the Heads and their senior management team will continue to retain responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the school. Following an acquisition of a new school, we seek to maximize student retention during the integration process as well as desired retention of the Head Teacher and teachers. A key part of the integration process involves acquiring an in-depth understanding of parental preferences and current levels of parent satisfaction. We also engage in new marketing activities aimed at increasing student enrollment and parental satisfaction. As part of our integration process, we also review existing teaching practices and implement any required changes to drive academic excellence and we may recruit new teachers and train existing teachers to ensure a high quality of teachers and support staff.

Such tender processes are customary in certain countries in Asia to meet the increasing demand for education. As part of our strategy to optimize our operations by participating in markets which meet our selection criteria, we evaluate these greenfield investments on an opportunistic basis. If successful, we would be required to develop and operate such new schools within a specified timeframe. 112 ----- Greenfield investments may be an attractive option to enter a market where there is very substantial unmet demand and likely future demand growth. To date, we have completed two greenfield projects. In 2009, we opened the Stamford American International School in Singapore, which was initially built as a foundation campus on a temporary site. The school subsequently moved to a “state-of-the-art” campus in 2012, which currently has a capacity of 3,300 students, excluding the Early Learning Village. The number of FTE students enrolled at Stamford American International School increased by 230 FTE students or 8.8% to 2,846 FTE students as of August 31, 2018 from 2,616 FTE students as of August 31, 2016. In September 2017, we opened the Stamford American School located in Kowloon, Hong Kong with 350 FTE students in its first full academic year and which has capacity for over 800 FTE students (not including a planned annex, which would bring total capacity up to 1,100 FTE students). The school began its second year with an enrollment of approximately 600 students and has demonstrated strong re-enrollment rates reflecting the quality of education. In addition, in December 2014 we entered into an agreement with a real estate developer in Chile for the construction of a school in Lampa, a suburb located to the northwest of Santiago. The school opened in February 2016 as Colegio Pamahue Chicauma. As of August 31, 2018, it had capacity for 474 students and an enrollment of 360 students. We are required to purchase the school and pay for the construction costs only when we achieve enrollment of 650 students. If we have not reached enrollment of 650 students by December 2025, we have the option to terminate this agreement without any further obligations to operate or purchase the school or to pay the construction costs. If we reach enrollment of 650 students at any time prior to December 2025, we will be required to pay the developer the purchase price of the school and construction costs in an amount representing a fixed sum for the land plus a variable component for the construction, the aggregate of which we currently estimate to be approximately of £9.9 million.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

While we standardize best practice across all of our schools, our local personnel retain the flexibility to vary marketing tactics according to local requirements. The majority of our inquiries are generated through the following methods: _Website and Digital Marketing_ We recognize that online marketing is a critical means of communication with prospective parents and students, as well as families of our existing students. Each school has its own website which is designed to serve both 113 ----- current and prospective parents, with information organized separately for each group. For prospective parents, our websites are designed to convey our mission of providing an “Inspiring World of Education,” in a userfriendly manner to inform decision making and to enable ease of navigation through the use of online application forms. We also use video content to highlight the school experience. In addition to developing attractive, well-structured school websites that support our marketing and admissions process, we utilize online advertising campaigns, effective search engine optimization and integration with social media to enhance our communications with parents. We regularly monitor our websites and online inquiry generation programs to enable adjustments to be made to campaigns and websites in order to optimize responsiveness. Our digital efforts are supported by digital marketing agencies, whose expertise further complements that of our internal staff. _Parent Referrals_ We understand that some prospective parents may seek out parents of current and former students to solicit their opinions on our schools. We encourage the parents of current and former students to speak positively about our schools, and we believe we achieve this by providing high quality education, communicating with and involving parents in our schools and seeking to place each of our schools at the center of its community through initiatives including: - **_Inclusive Events for Parents. Each school holds regular events, which parents are encouraged to attend and at which they are able to interact with other parents. For example, some of our schools provide weekend family days for students and their parents, parent engagement groups, which brings small groups of parents together to provide feedback to the school and to discuss ideas for further development, and parent coffee mornings, which offer a relaxed environment for parents to meet informally with staff of the school and to socialize with each other. - **_Community Relationship Building. Each school strives to develop strong relationships with local organizations in the catchment. Partner organizations can include play groups, nurseries, and junior schools that serve as feeder institutions to our schools, and sports leisure and social clubs for families that match the profile of the schools’ parent body. - **_Charitable Activities. All our schools participate in philanthropic initiatives that raise funds for local and national charities. Many school fundraising activities include parents, staff and students. _Relocation Agents_ In expatriate markets, relocation agents are an important source of inquiries. We develop close relationships with these relocation agents through a variety of initiatives, such as hosting school visits, providing quality information on our schools and producing user-friendly materials they can share with their clients. _Employers_ Within our expatriate markets, we have established relationships with certain major employers, including multinational corporations and embassies. We understand that parents consult their employers for school recommendations and information and we invite key personnel from leading corporations to participate in community events that we organize in order to foster good relationships with these employers and to showcase our schools. _Other Marketing Activities_ We support our marketing program with targeted communications, including: - **_Promotional Materials. We use promotional materials such as school brochures, educational magazines and other publications to enhance our schools’ reputation as high quality and leading academic institutions. - **_Public Relations. We create and distribute positive news stories, including news about our academic results and quality of our school facilities to promote our schools’ profiles in the media.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Based on our experience, parents generally visit two or three schools before selecting the schools to which they will apply. As a result, our management of school visits is important to convert inquiries into enrollments, and we have designed our systems to help maximize the 114 ----- conversion of inquiries into enrollments. For example, as part of our typical school visits, we provide an opportunity for prospective parents and students to interact with the teachers who will educate the child, as in our experience, a parent’s perception of a school’s academic quality is a key factor in school selection. We also seek to ensure that promotional materials are provided to prospective parents and that such materials provide appropriate information to convey each school’s academic credentials, such as standardized tests, examination outcomes, scholarships achieved and university admissions. Within each school, a dedicated admissions officer is responsible for handling parent inquiries, which includes coordinating the school visit, ensuring that appropriate information is provided to the prospective parent and maintaining close contact with the family throughout the entire process. Admissions officers work closely with our Heads and teachers to ensure that individual school tours are tailored to the needs of the family and that the most relevant teachers are available to meet with the families during their visit.

The most important aspect in maximizing student retention is to ensure that the school understands and meets the developing needs of both its students and its parents, and that any issues or concerns that may arise are addressed promptly. Our schools employ a number of methods to encourage parent feedback, which include regular parent engagement groups and parent surveys. In addition, we ensure that our teachers are accessible to parents. We use the data obtained through these processes to develop proactive retention strategies and we seek to take prompt corrective action with respect to any weaknesses identified in a particular school.

Within this framework, particular emphasis is placed on standardized and comprehensive customer data gathering and proactive inquiry management through customer relationship management systems, including Salesforce in Singapore, interaction with school academic staff and a personalized service, in order to create a positive experience for each individual family. While our student recruitment process consists of several stages, the key metrics in relation to our admissions processes are the number of inquiries received by the school and the conversion of these inquiries into enrollments. We have tools to monitor admissions KPIs. Through these tools, we monitor and analyze the source of inquiries, demand for places and conversion of inquiries into enrollments by enrollment year and grade, current and expected enrollments versus available capacity, current admissions pipeline and the status of each inquiry. Schools maintain their own database to record relevant information about prospective parents, which allows the school’s team to manage and progress each inquiry as well as provide management reporting. - _Inquiries/Applications: parents considering enrolling their child at one of our schools register their child’s details and request further information from the relevant school. Once the information is received, parents will likely visit the school for a tour or admissions event and then will choose whether to apply for a place at the school by completing an application form and paying an application fee. - _Admissions/Enrollments: if offered a place at one of our schools, parents are required to confirm the acceptance of the place by signing a contract.

84,Offerings 2018.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Europe,58.1.1,England and Wales,"Section 463 of the Education Act 1996 (as amended) defines an independent school in England and Wales as any school at which full time education is provided for five or more students of compulsory school age (i.e., five to 16 years old), or one or more such students with an Education Health and Care Plan or a statement of special educational needs or who is “looked after” by a local authority, and is not a school maintained by U.K. local authority or a non-maintained special school. In England, such independent school must register with the Secretary of State for Education (the “SSE”), that is responsible for the work of the Department for Education (the “DfE”). In Wales, an independent school must register with the Welsh Ministers (“WM”), who form part of the Welsh Government. Independent schools must be registered before they start to operate and failure to do so is an offence punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment. Establishments that cater to children under the age of five are required to register as an independent school if they meet the definition of an independent school. If an establishment caters for children solely under the age of five, in England they must register with the Ofsted Early Years Directorate and in Wales with the Wales Care & Social Services Inspectorate (“CSSIW”). Establishments offering education solely for 16 to 19 year olds do not need to register as independent schools. The SSE and the WM must be satisfied that the Independent School Standards are likely to be met before a school can be registered. These standards are set out in the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 and the Independent School Standards (Wales) Regulations 2003, respectively (collectively the “Regulations”). Once a complete application is made in England, the SSE will ask the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (“Ofsted”) (which oversees various aspects of state and independent schools in England) to inspect the school and provide a report as to whether the school is likely to meet these standards upon registration. The SSE will consider the report from Ofsted and any other evidence available in coming to a decision. The process in Wales is similar with Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales (“Estyn”) (which oversees various aspects of state and independent schools in Wales) providing the report to WM. If the school is a boarding school it will also be inspected by CSSIW. The application process generally takes around six months from receipt of a complete application. If the registration is not granted within the timescales proposed it will not be deemed to have been granted. Pupils must not be admitted to the school until such school has received confirmation that it has been included in the Register of Independent Schools. The Regulations require the SSE or the WM to make checks on any individual responsible for the day to day management of an independent school. The individual must not be barred under section 3(2) of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and checks must be undertaken in respect of the person’s identity and right to work in the United Kingdom. An enhanced criminal record check must also be undertaken. In England, this record check must be countersigned by the SSE and in Wales, by a Welsh Government official. If the proprietor has lived overseas, checks must also be made with the relevant overseas authorities and/or such other checks as the SSE or WM, as applicable, directs. If the proprietor is a formally constituted board of governors, directors or trustees, a trust or a limited company, only the chair will be required to undergo such checks. When inspected, a school will be required to provide evidence that these checks have been carried out and recorded on a ‘single central register. Proprietors must ensure that staff also meet all the above requirements and, in addition, if staff care for, train or are in charge of boarders, the National Minimum Standards for boarding schools must be met or for boarding schools which cater wholly or mainly for pupils with special educational needs, the National Minimum Standards for Residential Special Schools must be met. The DfE guidance states that all new independent schools are required to have an Ofsted inspection in their first year of operation, and provided that all Independent School Standards are met, schools will be inspected on a regular basis thereafter. Schools that belong to an Independent Schools Association, such as our schools in England, will have inspections carried out by an independent inspectorate rather than Ofsted. The Welsh Government guidance states that Estyn will carry out an inspection between three and six months after the date the school is registered (and, if it is a boarding school, will also be inspected again by CCSIW), and at least every six years thereafter to judge compliance with the Independent School Standards. Independent schools can be inspected at any time and inspections will be more frequent where there is a cause for concern. If there is evidence that a school is failing to meet the required Independent School Standards, and the SSE or the WM, as 122 ----- applicable, considers that there is a risk of serious harm to the welfare of the students, the school can be removed from the Register of Independent Schools, subject to appeal. In all other circumstances where the results of an inspection or other evidence reveals that the school does not meet one or more of the standards, the standards that are not being met will be identified and the SSE or the WM, as applicable, will require the proprietor to submit an action plan on how the issue will be remedied within a specified period of time. If the plan is rejected, or the issue is not remedied in line with an agreed action plan, then the SSE or the WM, as applicable, can remove the independent school from the register (after the conclusion of an appeal), require the proprietor to cease using any part of the school’s premises, close any part of the school’s operation or order the school to cease to admit new students or students of a certain description. Decisions made by the SSE or the WM, as applicable, are subject to appeal within 28 days. All independent schools must gain approval from the SSE or the WM, as applicable, before making material changes, including, for example, a change of proprietor or a change to admit, or cease to admit, children with special educational needs. Whilst the majority of changes will be approved quickly, some can take up to six months, and if approval is not forthcoming within six months, it will not be deemed to have been granted. Where a material change is made without seeking approval, the SSE or the WM, as applicable, may remove the school from the register of independent school. Education providers in England and Wales are prohibited under the Equality Act 2010 from discriminating in relation to admissions, exclusions, provision of education and access to any benefit, facility or service on the grounds of any of the relevant “protected characteristics.” Such protected characteristics are disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Schools in England and Wales must also comply with a range of other legislation that includes, among others, child welfare and protection, health and safety, data protection and food safety. Schools are required to have relevant policies in place that address such issues.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Europe,58.1.2,Spain,"Spanish privately-owned foreign schools are mainly regulated under the Royal Decree 806/1993, May 28 (the “Spanish Royal Decree 806/1993”), which specifically regulates the regime applicable to foreign schools in Spain, and more generally by the Organic Law 8/1985, July 3, which regulates the right to education; the Organic Law 2/2006, May 3, which regulates education; and the Royal Decree 332/1992, April 3, which regulates authorizations of private schools to teach under the non-university education general regime (the “Spanish Royal _Decree 332/1992”). Under the scope of the Spanish Constitution, all these regulations are guided by the general_ principle of freedom to found public or private educational establishments (article 27.6). Pursuant to the Spanish Royal Decree 806/1993 and the Organic Law 8/1985, all natural or legal persons can be a holder of a privately-owned foreign school in Spain, regardless of their nationality, with the exception of: - persons that already provide services to the Spanish national, regional (Autonomous Community) or local education administrations; - persons who have any criminal record for intentional crimes; and - persons expressly deprived of this right by judgment. For legal persons, the above mentioned restrictions will apply when the person affected by the restriction holds a governing position or 20% or more of the issued share capital. In order to operate in Spain, schools must obtain authorization from the Spanish Ministry of Education. The Spanish Royal Decree 332/1992 governs the general administrative procedure for the granting of authorizations of private schools to teach under the non-university education general regime. According to this regulation, the authorizations to operate privately-owned foreign schools in Spain will be granted provided the applying education centers meet the minimum administrative requirements. Where such centers do not meet or, subsequently fall below, the minimum requirements, the authorizations shall not be awarded or may subsequently be revoked. Once granted, as a general rule the authorization does not need to be renewed and the schools are registered with the Public Registry of Schools and subject to inspection. In order to obtain the required authorization to operate in Spain, foreign privately-owned schools must satisfy: (i) both basic requirements applicable to all Spanish schools (such as adequate hygiene, safety, acoustic, and habitability conditions at the school premises, and architectural characteristics to guarantee the mobility of disabled students); as well as (ii) the relevant requirements of the applicable education authorities for the specific curricula taught in every school. 123 ----- Where modifications to the education centers and/or authorized teaching programmes (amongst others, as foreseen in article 13 of Spanish Royal Decree 332/1992) are implemented, such modifications would require additional administrative approval. Foreign educational curricula is required to include certain Spanish-specific contents. In the case of international schools that do not follow the Spanish curricula, schools are required to seek an international accreditation and ratification from the relevant foreign embassy, a copy of which is provided to the Ministry of Education before the local Spanish authorization is granted. All of our schools in Spain are accredited by the National Association of British Schools in Spain and have been accredited and ratified by the British Council. Schools in Spain must comply with a range of legislation and other directives that include child welfare and protection, criminal records checks, health and safety, data protection, racial equality, disability discrimination, food allergy and school trips.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,Asia,58.2.1,Singapore,"The primary regulator for private education providers in Singapore, is the Committee for Private Education (the “CPE”), which was appointed by SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (“SSG”) to carry out SSG’s functions and powers under the Private Education Act (Cap. 247A) of Singapore (“PE Act”). Asides from being tasked with regulating the private education sector, the CPE also provides student services, consumer education and facilitates capability development efforts to uplift standards in the local private education industry. Notably, a private education institution must be deemed suitable for the delivery of private education by relevant land planning and fire safety authorities, therefore a private education institution must seek the CPE’s permission before operating in and making any changes to its premises. The managers of the private education institution, which in relation to a corporate body means any director, partner or member of its board or committee of management, or other similar officer of the corporate body, and includes any person in accordance with whose directions, instructions or wishes such directors, partners or other members (as the case may be) are accustomed or under an obligation to, to abide (whether formally or informally), must also meet the fit and proper criteria based on the guidelines issued by the CPE. Under Section 34 of the PE Act, no person in Singapore may offer to provide or provide private education, or award any degree, diploma or certificate (including any honorary degree or other distinctions) in respect of private education, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, unless the person is registered as a private education institution. The registration periods granted by the CPE are 2 years, 4 years or 6 years and the registration of a private education institution is subject to renewal. Every renewed period of registration will be determined by the CPE based on a set of criteria. Application for renewal of such registration should be submitted to the CPE at least 3 months prior to the date of expiry of the existing term of registration. In this respect, the Australian International School has been granted a four year registration from 6 July 2015 to 5 July 2019. The Stamford American International School has been granted a four year registration from 10 August 2018 to 9 August 2022. The Private Education Regulations 2009 also provides, inter alia, that every private education institution shall establish an academic board and an examination board. In addition, every registered private education institution is required to prepare and submit an annual report of its activities and affairs to the CPE by 31st December (or by any other stipulated date as advised by the CPE) of every year. In addition to being registered with the CPE, the Australian International School and the Stamford American International School have also been awarded the EduTrust Award under the EduTrust Certification scheme, which is a voluntary quality assurance scheme that helps to distinguish higher quality educational institutions in Singapore’s private education industry. There are three EduTrust certification awards under the EduTrust Certification Scheme. In particular, the EduTrust award (which was given to the Australian International School and the Stamford American International School) is awarded to private education institutions for sustaining an excellent level of performance in managing their institutions and providing high quality education standards and welfare for their students. The EduTrust certification has a validity of up to four years. Certification is done through an assessment of how well the private education institution’s systems and processes address and align with the seven criteria required under the EduTrust framework and produce the desired outcomes through effective implementation. The seven criteria are: (i) management commitment and responsibilities, (ii) corporate governance and administration, (iii) management of external recruitment agents, (iv) student protection and support services, (v) academic processes and assessment of students, (vi) the achievement of student and graduate outcomes, and (vii) quality assurance, monitoring and results. Singapore citizens who reside in Singapore are required to attend national schools and are not permitted to attend foreign system schools or private education institutions unless approval has been granted by the Ministry of 124 ----- Education. Such applications are assessed and granted on a case-by-case basis by the Ministry of Education and may be subject to terms and conditions. In respect of the fee collection restrictions, save for the exception of imposing charges for late payment of course fees, a private education institution is not allowed to collect deposits or penalties from any student for any purpose regardless of whether such deposit or penalty is refundable or not. In addition, a registered private education institution that is not specified in the Third Schedule of the Private Education Regulations 2009 of Singapore is required to comply with the statutorily prescribed fee collection schedule for courses that last more than two months.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,Asia,58.2.2,Thailand,"The key regulations in regards to education in Thailand are the National Education Act and the Private Schools Act. The National Education Act outlines the fundamental rights and duties regarding the education of Thai people and provides for the establishment of the Office of the National Education Standards and Quality Assessment (“NESQA”). The NESQA is a public organization that ensures that education is properly provided and assesses whether the provision of education complies with the national education policy and serves the needs of the people. The Private Schools Act regulates the private school business in Thailand. It establishes the Office of the Private Education Commission (“OPEC”), which, under the supervision of the Office of the Permanent Secretary for Education, provides general oversight for K-12 education in Thailand and promotes and supports private education data and registration, as well as monitors and evaluates the provision of private education. The Private Schools Act requires that, in order to establish a private school (formally or informally), a license must first be obtained from the Secretary-General of OPEC located in Bangkok, so long as the private school is to be located in Bangkok. If the private school is to be located outside Bangkok, the license must be applied for at the Provincial Primary Educational Service Area Office located in the respective province where such school is located unless the District Office of Private Education is established in such province. The application for a private school license must include evidence demonstrating that upon being granted a license, a school will have ownership or a possessory right of land for a period of no less than 10 years. The license holder can be either an individual or a corporate entity possessing qualifications as established in the Private Schools Act and the notification promulgated thereunder. In the event that there is an individual license holder, such individual must be of Thai nationality. In cases where the license holder is a corporate entity, no less than half of the total number of shares of such entity is required to be held by Thai persons (individual or entity) and no less than half of the total number of shareholders is required to be of Thai nationality (individual or entity). Our license is owned by an entity which is owned by a Thai person for purposes of these rules, but that person has assigned all of his ownership rights to us, which we believe is not unusual in various sectors which have foreign ownership restrictions in Thailand. While such nominee structures in the international school education sector have not been challenged by regulators, the position is uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are _subject to rules arising from our ownership structures in Thailand and Vietnam.” Private school licenses are_ transferable provided that certain statutory requirements are met. The school entity is a separate entity from the license holder for the school, and the license holder shall act as representative of such school entity. The school charter forms the relationship between the license holder and the school. The school is governed under the school charter and operated by the executive board consisting of the license holder, the manager of the school, the director of the school, teacher representatives, representatives of the students’ parents, and other qualified members (the “Executive Board”). Changes to the school charter and details relating to the school’s business, including operating plan or tuition fees, after obtaining a private school license, shall require prior approval from the Executive Board and the corresponding authority. In order to maintain the required authorization from the Ministry of Education, schools are required to comply with the Private Schools Act and other rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Schools in Thailand must also comply with a range of applicable legislation and other directives that include without limitation legislation and directives related to child welfare and protection, health and safety, data protection, racial equality, and disability and religion discrimination. Tuition fees and other fees are fixed by the Executive Board and shall be publicly announced within the school area. If the Ministry of Education or OPEC determines that the school charges tuition fees that create an excessive burden on the public or seeks exorbitant profits and the school fails to justify such exorbitant profits, the Ministry of Education or OPEC has the power to order the reduction of tuition fees as they deem appropriate.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Foreign operators are also required to register and obtain a requisite approval from the Department of Planning and Investment with respect to its investment or acquisition of any existing enterprise owning and operating schools in Vietnam. Where a new enterprise is to be incorporated to implement an investment project in the education sector, the foreign investors are required to first obtain an Investment Registration Certificate and an Enterprise Registration Certificate for such project from the Department of Planning and Investment. Vietnam laws allow up to 100% foreign ownership of an educational establishment; however, foreign operators must meet minimum requirements in terms of, amongst other things, investment per capita, student intake and teaching staff in order to obtain an “Education Operation Decision.” Also, subsequent to the passage of a new decree in 2018, Vietnamese students are entitled to study foreign curriculum at general education schools (including at the primary, secondary and high school level) and also at kindergartens/pre-schools although the enrollment rate of Vietnamese students at such schools is limited. In particular, pursuant to this decree, the number of Vietnamese students studying foreign curriculum in foreigninvested schools must be less than 50% of the total number of students studying foreign curriculum at such school. Such enrollment rate under the new decree however is much more favourable than the rate under the former decree, and appears to evidence a push towards encouraging foreign investment in the education sector in Vietnam. Under the new decree, foreign-invested schools which received permission for establishment or for their educational operations prior to the effective date of such decree, are not required to apply for recommencement of operations. Further, the investment law of Vietnam also offers a principle that, where a new legal instrument which is introduced provides lower investment incentives than those which the investor has previously enjoyed, the investor shall continue to be entitled to the investment incentives in accordance with the previous regulations for the remaining duration to which the project is entitled to incentives. Therefore, schools operated pursuant to operational licenses granted prior to the adoption of the new decree, are not required to amend their current license to limit enrollment of Vietnamese students as prescribed by the decree. Do however note the “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are subject to rules arising from our ownership structures in Thailand and Vietnam.”_ There are no restrictions for foreign-invested tertiary and vocational/short-term training establishments (i.e., up to 100% of student recruits can be Vietnamese). Furthermore, schools that admit Vietnamese national students are required to maintain provision of certain local subjects, as prescribed by the Minister of Education and Training. We hold licenses at both International School Ho Chi Minh City and International School Ho Chi Minh City, American Academy to teach an international curriculum to Vietnamese national students. Schools in Vietnam must comply with a range of legislation and other directives that include child welfare and protection, criminal records checks, health and safety, data protection, racial equality, disability discrimination, food allergy and school trips.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496
84,Offerings 2018.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,Asia,58.2.4,Hong Kong,"Section 3 of the Education Ordinance (Cap. 279) (“EO”) defines a “school” as “an institution, organization or _establishment which provides for 20 or more persons during any one day or 8 or more persons at any one time, any nursery, kindergarten, primary, secondary or post-secondary education or any other educational course by any means, including correspondence delivered by hand or through the postal services.” Each category of_ institution is classified by age e.g. a nursery provides a one year course of education that normally begins when a child turns 3, whereas a primary school provides a 6 year course of education normally commencing when a child turns 6. Generally, schools are regulated by the Education Bureau (“EDB”), in coordination with the following government departments which make recommendations and issue requirements for school premises: Planning Department (“PD”), Land Department (“LD”), Fire Services Department (“FSD”), Buildings Department (“BD”)/ Independent Checking Unit, Office of the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Housing (Housing) (“ICU”) and the Department of Health (“DH”). Kindergarten falls within the definition of a “school”, but some kindergartens also provide child care services i.e. as kindergarten-cum-child care centers. These are jointly regulated by the Social Welfare Department (“SWD”) and the EDB (in collaboration with the above-mentioned government departments issuing premises requirements) through the Joint Office for Kindergartens and Child Care Centers of the EDB (“Joint Office”). Under section 2 of the Child Care Services Ordinance (Cap. 243) (“CCSO”), a “child care center” is defined as, _inter alia, “any premises which habitually receive at any one time more than 5 children who are under the age of_ 126 ----- _3 years for the purposes of care and supervision.” In this regard, kindergartens and/ or institutions which provide_ such services fall under the CCSO regime. The majority of the Woodland schools operated by the Group are classified as playgroups and do not fall within the remit of the EO or the CCSO and are therefore not required to be registered as long as the attending children are accompanied by an adult parent or helper. To operate a school in Hong Kong, an application must be submitted to the Permanent Secretary for Education (the “Permanent Secretary”). Upon compliance and/or clearance with: - PD on whether the proposed premise is permitted for school use under the Town Planning Ordinance (Cap. 131); - LD on confirmation that school use does not contravene the lease condition of the proposed premises; - FSD and BD/ICU on (fire) safety of the proposed premises; and - EDB on the overall suitability of the school, taking into account, among other factors, school layout plans, fees to be charged, syllabus, curriculum planning, meal plans for students, registration of the school manager (on management and quality assurance of the school), employment expenditure of teaching staff, the Permanent Secretary will grant a provisional registration to the school, as the Permanent Secretary thinks fit, with a validity period of one year (the “Validity Period”). The Permanent Secretary may extend the period of provisional registration of a school for a further period not exceeding 12 months at a time as he thinks fit. A school that can demonstrate full compliance with further requirements of: - EDB on school management (e.g. number of students enrolled, registration of teachers, etc.); - DH on health-related requirements (e.g. sanitary facilities, water supply, school space, meals, etc.); and - requirements set by FSD and BD/ICU (if any), will be granted a full registration. A provisionally-registered school that fails to demonstrate full compliance and has not been granted an extension on its Validity Period from the Permanent Secretary will become an unregistered school upon expiry of such Validity Period and will have to cease operations. There is no validity period once a school is fully registered, but such school is expected to remain compliant with the application requirements throughout the registration period. A school registration may be cancelled in accordance with section 22 of the EO, for example, for contravention of the EO, unsatisfactory school management and/or where the relevant premises has become unsuitable for use as a school. The Permanent Secretary may by order in writing close any premises of a school which is not registered or provisionally registered. In addition to obtaining the above-mentioned registration from the Permanent Secretary for operation of a school, kindergarten-cum-child care centers should also apply for registration of a child care center within proposed/ registered kindergarten premises with the Joint Office. The requirements are similar to those of a kindergarten, such as the clearance with FSD and BD/ICU on the safety of the premises; with additional applications covering, among other things: - registration of personal particulars of the operator of the child care center (as required under section 8 of the CCSO and is open for public inspection); - timetable of daily activities of the child care center; - dietary scale and menu for centers operating full day services; - application for approval of child care center fees; and - name of the employee who holds a valid first aid certificate. While kindergarten-cum-child care centers are expected to remain compliant with the application requirements, there are particular on-going compliance requirements such as arrangement for regular inspection and maintenance of fixed electrical installation and gas installation. The Certificate of Registration of a kindergarten-cum-child care center will remain valid unless cancelled by the Joint Office pursuant to section 9 of the CCSO (on grounds including contravention of the CCSO) and/or section 22 of the EO.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The MINEDUC oversees 127 ----- the performance of all the different agents involved in educational activities and it has a presence throughout the country by means of regional offices (Secretaria Regional Ministerial or “SEREMI”). The Superintendence of Education monitors recognized schools and its sponsors, ensuring that all recognized schools’ operations meet the relevant regulations. The main statute regarding schools is the General Law of Education (Law N° 20.370), which provides a series of rights and obligations regarding students, parents, teachers, sponsors and schools. In addition, Decree N° 315 enacted by the MINEDUC sets forth the process and requirements for obtaining the State’s recognition for a school, how to maintain it and what may cause its cancellation or revocation. Importantly, all private schools (including those receiving state subsidies) must have a sponsor (or sostenedor) by law. In the case of private schools the sponsor must be a private legal entity, which sole corporate purpose must be to act as a sponsor of an educational establishment. The law does not discriminate between national and foreign sponsors, so there is no issue concerning foreign ownership of schools, whether partial or absolute. Licensing is handled by the corresponding SEREMI. The remaining regulations related to educational matters stem from the MINEDUC and focus on specific issues, such as academic content for specific levels or the minimum requirements for being able to teach in schools. Schools are subject to inspections performed by the Superintendence of Education. These inspections may be previously arranged or may be random and unscheduled. The Superintendence of Education may also impose four types of penalties to schools for legal or regulatory non-compliance: written admonishments; fines, ranging from approximately $70 to $70,000 (in private schools, the average cost of tuition is taken into consideration when determining the amount of the fine); temporary or definitive inability to act as sponsor for a school; and revocation of the State’s recognition of the school. The harshness of the penalty ultimately imposed shall depend on the seriousness of the school’s non-compliance or infraction, as well as its cooperation or lack thereof in rectifying such non-compliance. In addition, the school may also be penalized with fines or temporary closing of its premises if it fails to comply with the regulation concerning hygienic and construction matters. Admission requirements in private schools must be pursuant to objective, clear and non-arbitrary parameters and must ensure the dignity of the applicants and their families. Provided this requirement is met, private schools are free to set forth its own set of requirements, such as religious beliefs, nationality, academic performance, and family composition. There are no statutes or regulations requiring a minimum percentage of Chilean students. Private schools are also free to determine the amount, payment term and conditions of tuition and its related admission process, enrollment, parent associations’ fees and any other costs of enrollment. During the academic year, the school may not suspend or expel a student due to any unpaid and outstanding tuition fee. Schools in Chile must also comply with hygiene and construction codes, as well with a wide ranging set of laws, regulations and other directives that include child welfare and protection, criminal records checks, safety, data protection, and disability discrimination.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Brazil’s federal government regulates the country’s education system through the Ministry of Education (Ministério da Educação), provided that federal, state and local governments organize, in cooperation, the education system in the country, based on the guidelines issued by the federal government. Licensing is handled by the school’s state or local government, depending upon the type of school. Specifically, state governments are responsible for the licensing of all private elementary schools and high schools located within their respective jurisdictions, while local governments are responsible for the licensing of private early childhood education programs. Local and state governments are also responsible for establishing state education programs for public schools following the guidelines and using the funding supplied by the federal government, in addition to their own financial resources. The rendering of educational services at any level is permitted to private entities, provided that these entities (a) are in compliance with the regulations issued by the federal, state, and local governments, where applicable; (b) obtain the required authorization from the competent governmental authority; and (c) are able to finance their activities. In order to maintain the required authorization from federal, state, and local governments, a private school must satisfy certain requirements ranging from the suitability of its physical facilities to the qualification of its teachers and the structure of its curriculum, among other specific requirements depending upon the type of school and the level of education provided. The licensing authorities have the power to check compliance with such requirements periodically and non-compliance may lead to the revocation of the school’s existing permits. 128 ----- Aside from certain age requirements in relation to the grade a student can be enrolled in, there are no specific rules that Brazilian schools must follow when deciding whether or not to accept or maintain any given student. However, regulators may levy sanctions against a school using discriminatory admissions or expulsion practices. Private schools are unregulated with regards to determining tuition rates and charging any other fees to their students.

Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Registered Notes: (1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Definitive Notes; (2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Definitive Notes to be redeemed in part; (3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to such Registered Notes; or 168 ----- (4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by Lernen Bidco Limited. It is intended that as soon as practicable but in any case by no later than the date falling 120 days after the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by: (i) Australian International School Pte Ltd (Singapore); (ii) Stamford American International School Pte Ltd (Singapore); and (iii) Cognita Schools Limited (UK). It is intended that the Guarantors will grant the Notes Guarantees and will also grant senior guarantees of the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes _Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, it is intended that_ each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Senior Facilities Agreement or certain other indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements – Senior Facilities Agreement”. As of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the Guarantors represented, based on their contribution in our consolidated financial statements, 59% of revenue, 70% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) and 52% of assets. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information— Target and Future _Guarantor Coverage.” As of August 31, 2018, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and_ the use of proceeds therefrom, on a consolidated basis, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €50.2 million in outstanding debt. Only certain subsidiaries will provide Notes Guarantees and guarantee obligations under the Notes. Our subsidiaries organized in Brazil, Chile, Spain, Vietnam, Thailand and Mainland China (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, Hong Kong) will not guarantee the obligations under the Notes. A consolidated total coverage ratio calculated on this basis does not necessarily reflect the individual asset positions of corporate entities in the event of insolvency. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other limitations or legal or regulatory requirements or other restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, liquidity protection rules, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Each _Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure— Our subsidiaries located in Spain, Chile, Brazil, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam will not guarantee the Notes, and the Notes and each of the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes.”_ 169 ----- The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon: - a sale, exchange, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including by way of consolidation, merger, amalgamation or combination) of ownership interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, including for the avoidance of doubt, any liquidation or dissolution or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor), in each case, otherwise permitted by, and in compliance with, the Indenture; - the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued under the Indenture or defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction _and Discharge;”_ - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Facilities Agreement and (ii) does not guarantee any other Credit Facility or Public Debt; - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;” - with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation— _Guarantors;” and_ - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization or solvent winding-up or liquidation (or similar) of a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, or as otherwise contemplated by the Indenture, the Trustee will execute any documents delivered to it by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee and any related Collateral. None of the Issuer, Trustee nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination. Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of nonguarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under_ their Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the Issue Date. In addition, the Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior 170 ----- Indebtedness.

The currency of the Intercompany Loan is Pound sterling, in line with the Company’s currency of account. The Intercompany Loan is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer will grant a security interest in respect of the receivables under the Intercompany Loan to secure, among other things, the Senior Facilities Agreement (on a senior basis) and the Notes (on a subordinated basis). See “—Security.” It is anticipated that funds received by the Issuer as payments of interest under the Intercompany Loan will be used, among other sources, to service interest payments under the Notes. The Intercompany Loan may have a variable interest rate and a rate that differs from the rate of interest payable on the Notes from time to time. The principal on the Intercompany Loan may be repaid in order to service interest payments on the Notes or otherwise. As a result the initial amount of the Intercompany Loan may be less than the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and may be reduced, potentially to zero, prior to the maturity of the Notes. Payments under the Intercompany Loan may also be restricted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and may also secure Hedging Obligations and additional Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the _Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted under the Agreed Security Principles and applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, the terms of the Security Documents themselves provide for assets to cease to become subject to security in certain circumstances without need for a formal release, such as the sale of assets which are subject to a charge, or the exclusion of certain assets if such assets may not be subject to security (such as, for example, assets that may not be validly pledged, or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien). As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Notes and a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee.

In determining whether the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes of such series in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes of such series, as applicable, Notes of such series owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the beneficiary would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period). In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees or this “Description of Notes”, any amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations thereunder or official interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices implementing such an intergovernmental agreement) (any such withholding or deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”).

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional _Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60_ days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 per cent. of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); 178 ----- (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly deliver via wire transfer to each holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to each holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes validly tender and do not withdraw Notes of such series in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to a Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes of such series in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of such series, as applicable, Notes of such series owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of Change of Control Offer. 179 ----- The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of the Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control (as described therein) would require the repayment of such debt in certain circumstances. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities”. The terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and other indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the _Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as required by each Indenture and the change of control provision contained in each Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

(b) all Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement whenever Incurred shall be deemed to have been incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant, and any such Indebtedness may not be reclassified pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph; (c) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of Bank Products, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(f) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and (g) the amount of Indebtedness shall be calculated as described under the definition of “Indebtedness.” Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change of IFRS to UK GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date. For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or, at the option of the Issuer, in a manner consistent with that contemplated by the second paragraph of the definition of “Consolidated Leverage”; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, costs, taxes, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result 183 ----- of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75 per cent. of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and (3) an amount equal to 100 per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied (directly or indirectly) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be: (a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 475 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below).

The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the holder thereof. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £25.0 million and 25 per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for holders to take action directly. holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Ownership of beneficial interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants or otherwise, and will be required to be effected in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Notes, the Indenture and in any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” The Book-Entry Interests will be held by Euroclear and Clearstream on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes in registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”). The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of Notes take physical possession of such Notes in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer, pledge or grant any other security interest in Book-Entry Interests. So long as the Global Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Global Notes for any purpose. So long as the Global Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or its respective nominee, will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.

The International Stock Exchange is a recognized stock exchange for these purposes. Securities will be treated as listed on the Exchange when they are admitted to the Official List of the Exchange. If the Notes cease to be listed, interest which has a United Kingdom source will generally be paid by the Issuer under deduction of income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent.) unless: (i) another relief applies under domestic law; or (ii) the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HM Revenue & Customs in respect of such relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty. If interest were paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax (e.g. if the Notes lost their listing), Noteholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty. _Payments in Respect of the Guarantee_ The United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor under the terms of the Guarantee in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemption from withholding on account of United Kingdom tax in respect of securities listed on a recognized stock exchange described above in relation to payments of interest by the Issuer.

Accordingly, interest on a Note (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on a payment on a Note) will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on such holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes constitutes income from sources outside the United States. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in a foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual 244 ----- period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or retirement of a Note) denominated in a foreign currency, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss ) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The amount realised does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors about to account for proceeds received on a sale or retirement of a Note that are not paid in U.S. dollars. A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the sale or retirement of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note (i) on the date of sale or retirement and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including any foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realised only to the extent of total gain or loss realised on the sale or retirement. Gain or loss (other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss described above) realised by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to tax on long-term capital gains at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.

This summary deals only with initial purchasers of Notes that acquire them in the Offering at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes are sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and that will hold the Notes as capital assets. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including consequences under the alternative minimum tax or net investment income tax), and does not address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws. This summary also does not address tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as certain financial institutions, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organisations, dealers in securities or 243 ----- currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States, investors holding the Notes in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States, U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar). As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organised under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership. Under recently enacted legislation, U.S. Holders that maintain certain types of financial statements and use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be required to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on their financial statements. The application of this rule may require U.S. Holders that maintain such financial statements to include certain amounts realized in respect of the Notes in income earlier than would otherwise be the case under the general rules described below, although the precise application of this rule is unclear at this time.

Such payments, where made to a person not known to the paying party to be a resident in Singapore for tax purposes, are generally subject to withholding tax in Singapore. The rate at which tax is to be withheld for such payments (other than those subject to the 15 per cent. final withholding tax described below) to non-resident persons (other than non-resident individuals) is currently 17 per cent. The applicable rate for non-resident individuals is currently 22 per cent. However, if the payment is derived by a person not resident in Singapore from sources other than from its trade, business, profession or vocation carried on or exercised by such person in Singapore and is not effectively connected with any permanent establishment in Singapore of that person, the payment is subject to a final withholding tax of 15 per cent. The rate of 15 per cent. may be reduced by applicable tax treaties. However, certain Singapore-sourced investment income derived by individuals from financial instruments is exempt from tax, including: (a) interest from debt securities derived on or after 1 January 2004; (b) discount income (not including discount income arising from secondary trading) from debt securities derived on or after 17 February 2006; and (c) prepayment fee, redemption premium and break cost from debt securities derived on or after 15 February 2007, except where such income is derived through a partnership in Singapore or is derived from the carrying on of a trade, business or profession in Singapore.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which entered into force on 26 June 2017 and applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date) recasting Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 (which continues to apply to any insolvency proceedings opened before June 26, 2017), (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the “centre of main interests” of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.” Prior to June 26, 2017, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main interests” may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the 3-month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. 248 ----- Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. All Member States (other than Denmark) shall recognize any judgment opening insolvency proceedings handed down by a court of a Member State which has jurisdiction to open such proceedings from the moment that it becomes effective in the State of the opening of proceedings. The judgment opening main insolvency proceedings shall, with no further formalities, produce the same effects in any other Member State as under the law of the State of the opening of proceedings, unless the EU Insolvency Regulation provides otherwise and as long as no secondary proceedings are opened in that other Member State. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise all the powers conferred on it, by the law of the State of the opening of proceedings, in another Member State, as long as no other insolvency proceedings have been opened there and no preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request for the opening of insolvency proceedings in that State.

The grounds which entitle the court to make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the IA86. Common grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts; and (ii) the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up. Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of shares, or alteration in the status of the company’s members is void if made following the commencement of the winding up unless the court orders otherwise. If a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced on the date on which the winding up petition was presented.

In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). The directors must seek a decision of the creditors to nominate a liquidator. If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail, unless the court determines otherwise. _Priority of Claims in an insolvency_ Upon liquidation of any English Obligor, the order of priorities is such that debts due by it to any holders of fixed charges over UK assets are paid first out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to such fixed charges (subject to the prior payment of the costs of preservation and realization of the fixed charge assets). Where there are floating charges, liquidation expenses (discussed further below), preferential creditors, and unsecured creditors to the extent of the “ring-fenced” Prescribed Part (as defined below) are paid out of the proceeds of realization of assets subject to those floating charges in priority to payments to creditors secured by virtue of those floating charges. Thereafter, any debts owing to holders of the floating charges would be paid to the extent they are secured by that charge. The categories of preferential debts include certain amounts payable in respect of occupational pension schemes relating to contributions due but unpaid and employee remuneration up to a specified amount. A certain part of the net proceeds of the realization of the assets covered by a floating charge (up to a maximum of £600,000) would be “ring-fenced” and made available pro rata to unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). Unsecured debts which are not preferential debts would be paid from the proceeds of realizations of unsecured assets (if any) and, after the secured liabilities have been met, from the proceeds of realization of relevant secured assets. As discussed further below, certain of the security interests over UK assets expected to be created in favor of the security agent will be expressed as fixed charges, but there is no certainty that the security will take effect as a fixed charge and it may well take effect as a floating charge. Where no security is provided to secure the obligations of an English Obligor, any principal debt or guarantee obligation of that English Obligor will be unsecured.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

A company may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. 250 ----- There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court following by a court order for administration (the “in-court route”); or (ii) the filing of certain prescribed forms with the court following which the administration takes effect (the “out-of-court route”). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms. A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument which either: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a QFC if he holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Administrations commenced on or after 15 September 2003 will have a single purpose, consisting of three consecutive objectives: (i) to rescue the company (corporate survival); then (ii) if that is not reasonably practicable, to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than on liquidation; then (iii) if neither are reasonably practicable, to realize property for secured or preferential creditors (this objective may only be followed if it does not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole). A company may only go into administration if the administration purpose is likely to be achieved. An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the application for an administration order is made, or the notice of intention to appoint an administrator out-of-court by notice is filed. The moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) may be commenced or continued against the company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property or any repossession rights under hire purchase, chattel leasing, conditional sale or retention of title agreements (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed and, except in certain limited circumstances, no resolution can be passed or order be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”) (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments). An administrator must exercise his functions to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, the administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property to which he thinks the company is entitled. He has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security. The permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed charge assets and the proceeds of sale must be paid to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent _Transaction Laws” in respect of the latter)._",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the English Obligor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the holder of the security, in practice. Where an English Obligor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the English Obligor’s net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the English Obligor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder. _Limitation on Enforcement_ The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with a English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

This includes ensuring that the Singapore Company has taken all corporate action, including the passing of corporate resolutions required under its constitutional documents, to authorize the execution by it of the guarantee or security documents and the exercise by it of its rights and the performance by it of its obligations under such guarantee or security documents. _Stamp duty_ Under Singapore law, stamp duty of up to a maximum of S$500 is imposed by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore in connection with the execution and delivery of any security documents which are stampable. _Registration requirements_ It is necessary under the laws of Singapore in order to ensure the validity, effectiveness, performance and/or enforceability of the security interests created by certain of the security documents registrable under Section 131 of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 of Singapore (the “Singapore Companies Act”) that the obligations created thereunder be registered as a charge with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority in Singapore within 30 days of such creation. _General Considerations for Enforcement of Guarantee or Security_ The general impediments to enforcement of a guarantee or security in Singapore include the following (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization and other laws affecting the rights of the creditors, including the appointment of a judicial manager over the company’s assets under Part VIIIA of the Singapore Companies Act and the avoidance of vulnerable or fraudulent transactions; and (b) general principles of equity which may dictate that equitable remedies may not always be given if for instance damages are adequate or there are illegality or public policy reasons. Any insolvency proceedings applicable to Singapore incorporated companies are likely to be governed by Singapore insolvency laws. If a scheme of arrangement or compromise is 254 ----- proposed pursuant to Section 210 of the Singapore Companies Act, the court may, subject to the laws governing such schemes, on the application of the relevant Singapore Company or of any member or creditor of such Singapore Company, restrain further proceedings in any action or proceeding against that Singapore Company except by leave of the Court. If a judicial manager is appointed under Part VIIIA of the Singapore Companies Act, all creditors of that Singapore Company would be prevented from enforcing any security over that Singapore Company’s assets, except with the consent of the judicial manager or with leave of the Court and (where the Court gives leave) subject to such terms as the Court may impose. _Transactions at Undervalue or Unfair Preference or Fraudulent Transactions_ The guarantee and/or the security given by a Singapore Company might be subject to challenges by a liquidator or a judicial manager under Singapore laws relating to transactions at an undervalue or preferential transactions. On the application of a liquidator or judicial manager, the Singapore courts may make such an order as they think fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the Singapore Company subject to the application had not entered into, inter alia, any of the following types of transactions: (a) a transaction with any person at an undervalue which took place at any time within the period of five years ending on the date of the commencement of the winding up. Where the transaction was entered into with a person who is a person associated with the Singapore Company (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee), the requirement that the Singapore Company was insolvent at the time of the transaction or became insolvent as a result of the transaction shall be presumed to be satisfied unless the contrary is shown; (b) a transaction under which an unfair preference is given by the Singapore Company to a person who is a person associated with the Singapore Company (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee), and which is not a transaction at an undervalue, at any time within the period of two years ending on the date of the commencement of the winding up; or (c) in any other case of a transaction under which an unfair preference is given by the Singapore Company, and which is not a transaction at an undervalue, at any time within the period of six months ending on the date of the commencement of the winding up, provided that the Singapore Company was insolvent when it entered into the transaction or became insolvent as a result of the transaction. A Singapore Company will be treated as having entered into a transaction with a person at an undervalue if: (A) it enters into a transaction with that person on terms that provide for it to receive no consideration; or (B) it enters into a transaction with that person for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by the Singapore Company. The Singapore courts will not make any order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the Singapore Company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it entered into the transaction, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would be of benefit to the Singapore Company. The Singapore Company will be treated as having given an unfair preference to another person if: (i) that person is a creditor of the Singapore Company or a surety provider or guarantor for a debt or other liability of the Singapore Company; and (ii) the Singapore Company does anything or suffers anything to be done that (in either case) has the effect of putting the person into a position which, in the event of the winding up of the Singapore Company, will be better than the position such person would have been in if that thing had not been done. The Singapore courts will not make an order in respect of an unfair preference given to any person unless the Singapore Company, when giving the unfair preference, was influenced in deciding to give the unfair preference by a desire to produce in relation to that person the effect referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) above. If the Singapore Company gave an unfair preference to a person who was, at the time the unfair preference was given, a person associated with the Singapore Company (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee), the Singapore Company shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to have been influenced in deciding to give the unfair preference by the desire referred to above. In addition, section 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, Chapter 61 of Singapore applies in respect of transactions to defraud creditors. Any transaction that is impugned pursuant to this section, upon proof of the intention to defraud creditors, is voidable at the instance of a person who has been prejudiced by such transaction. This provision applies to “every conveyance of property,” and not only to transactions at an undervalue. 255 ----- _Difference in insolvency law_ Any insolvency proceedings commenced in the Singapore courts with respect to a Singapore Company should be governed by Singapore insolvency laws. Singapore insolvency laws differ from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including the State of New York. Singapore has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on CrossBorder Insolvency (with certain modifications to adapt it for application in Singapore). _Priority of secured creditors and guarantees_ Singapore insolvency laws generally recognize the priority of secured creditors over unsecured creditors. A guarantee is a contractual undertaking and does not confer any priority in the event of insolvency. _Preferential creditors_ Under Section 328 of the Singapore Companies Act, in a winding-up of a Singapore Company, preferential debts are required to be paid in priority to all other debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Certain preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge (those listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) and (e) to (f) below) if the assets of the chargor company are insufficient to satisfy such preferential debts. The preferential debts covered by Section 328 of the Singapore Companies Act are described briefly below: (a) costs and expenses of the winding up; (b) employees’ wages and salaries; (c) retrenchment benefits under employment contracts; (d) work injury compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act, Chapter 354 of Singapore; (e) certain amounts due under employees’ superannuation or provident funds or under any scheme of superannuation which is an approved scheme under Singapore income tax laws; (f) remuneration payable in respect of employees’ vacation leave; and (g) taxes assessed and goods and services tax. _Disclaimer of onerous contracts_ Section 332 of the Singapore Companies Act provides that where any property of a company consists of either an estate or interest in land that is burdened with onerous covenants, shares in corporations, unprofitable contracts or any other property that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by reason of its binding the company to the performance of any onerous act or payment of any sum, the liquidator may apply to disclaim such property within twelve months of (i) commencement of winding-up or, (ii) where any such property has not come to the knowledge of the liquidator within one month after the commencement of winding-up, such powers of disclaiming may be exercised at any time within twelve months after the liquidator has become aware of such property or such extended period as is allowed by the court. _Extortionate Credit Transactions_ Extortionate credit transactions may be set aside or varied if they are entered into within a period of three years before the commencement of winding up or judicial management of the company. Credit transactions are extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the creditor, either the terms are such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it is harsh and unconscionable or substantially unfair. In determining whether such a transaction ought to be set aside, the Court will consider, among other things, whether the transaction was oppressive and reflective of an imbalance in bargaining power of which the creditor took improper advantage. _Floating Charges_ A floating charge created within six months of the commencement of the winding up of a company shall, unless it is proved that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge, be invalid except to the amount of any cash paid to the company at the time of or subsequently to the creation of and in consideration for the charge together with any prescribed rate of interest on that amount as may be applicable under the Companies Act (Cap. 50) of Singapore. 256 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Utilisation decreased by 3.1% to 75.8% for the year ended 31 August 2018 compared to the same period last year due to the additional capacity opened in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Brazil. Additions related to development capital expenditure represented £33.4m (2017: £116.8m) in total compared to operating capital expenditure of £24.9m (2017: £17.2m). Operating capital expenditure includes investment in ensuring schools maintain their standards and compliance with all regulations, whilst development capital expenditure represents investment made to expand capacity at the Group’s schools and for construction and development of other facilities which do not directly result in capacity expansion. fees become more affordable for foreign families looking to educate their children in the UK. A further consideration is that attracting and retaining students and teachers from the EU may become more difficult if visa entry requirements become more stringent or if our UK Visa and Immigrations Tier 2 and/or Tier 4 licences are revoked or cease to be renewed. _Regulatory changes: Cognita will be working closely with the National Association of British Schools in Spain,_ the Council of British International Schools and the British Council to review the impact of Brexit, if any, on the use of British qualifications for Spanish university entry and on Spanish students applying to British universities. _Downturn in the UK or European Economy: With operations in UK and Spain a downturn in the economies of_ mainland Europe or the UK following Brexit could result in reduced demand for school places and lower student numbers. Management’s view is that the Group’s diverse global portfolio and the robust nature of the education sector will provide resilience against the uncertainties faced during the Brexit transition period. During the year ended 31 August 2016, the Group refinanced substantially all of its debt, with the exception of debt held by Group companies in Brazil and Chile. Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued and the proceeds were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness and related costs. The Notes were due to mature on 15 August 2021. As part of this refinancing arrangement, deep discounted bonds previously issued by Cognita Topco Limited were collapsed via a capitalisation. At 31 August 2018, the Group had a total of £435m of Senior Secured Loan Notes in issue, £60m of which had been placed during the year. The post year end acquisition of the Cognita Topco Limited Group by Jacobs Holding AG prompted a refinancing of the majority of the Group’s debt, with new bank facilities drawn on 25 October 2018 totalling £652 million. This enabled the group to settle liabilities that were outstanding at 31 August 2018, including the £435m of Senior Secured Loan Notes, the Revolving Credit Facilities and Forward Currency Contracts, along with local debt in Hong Kong. The Directors have performed a review of the Group’s finances and have a reasonable expectation that the business has adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future and will be able to support the repayment of its debt facilities and related interest payments. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The Avondale school in Singapore was also merged with the Australian International School, Singapore during the year. Student numbers throughout the Group increased by 8.8% and average FTE staff numbers increased by 9.6% in the fiscal year ended 31 August 2018 compared to the prior period. The staff numbers increased at a faster rate than students due to the opening of new facilities. Student numbers increased (including the impact of acquisitions) by 8.8% in the year, with Europe growing by 0.3%, Asia by 12.6% and Latin America by 15.9%. Europe student numbers grew due to the opening of the Pre-University Centre at BSB, Spain in April 2018, offset by slightly fewer students in the UK. Asia student growth was primarily driven by the opening of Stamford American School in Hong Kong in September 2017, the opening of a new secondary school campus at ISHCMC, Vietnam and the acquisition of Woodland Pre-Schools group of nurseries in Hong Kong in May 2018. The growth in Latin America is predominantly attributable to the acquisition of American British School in March 2018 in Chile, along with growth across the Chile school’s portfolio where the bilingual programme continues to improve utilisation rates. The acquisition of Santo Tomas in August 2018 did not impact the above disclosed student numbers which are an average across the year. Capacity increased by 13.3% in the fiscal year ended 31 August 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended 31 August 2017. Of this increase, 8.1% was attributable to group expansion projects, most notably in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Brazil, while the remainder of the increase represented the net impact of acquisitions and divestments.

Consequently, Group Adjusted EBITDA (including 100% of joint venture Adjusted EBITDA) is considered the most relevant metric for information purposes. Group revenue (including 100% of the St Nicholas joint venture in the prior year) increased from £389.7m in 2017 to £430.5m in 2018, an increase of 10.5% or 12.2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue attributable to new acquisitions during the year ended 31 August 2018 represented 8.7% of the increase (2017: 8.6%), with the remainder due to the organic increase in student numbers and annual fee inflation. Regional Group Adjusted EBITDA grew by 10.2% (11.0% on a constant currency basis) and represents a margin of 18.7% of revenue (2017: 18.9%). Much of this increase relates to Latin America where the acquisition of the American British School has combined with organic growth across our Chile schools. The Latin America Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew 40.8% (44.8% on a constant currency basis) on revenues that grew by 14.3% (19.8% on a constant currency basis) in the same period. Europe also had strong growth in Regional Adjusted EBITDA of 12.7% (12.2% on a constant currency basis) predominantly related to growth in Spain, including the opening of the Pre-University Centre at BSB. Asia Regional Adjusted EBITDA which accounts for 51.0% (2017: 57.4%) of the Regional Group Adjusted EBITDA fell 2.8% (grew 0.1% on a constant currency basis) during the year. This lack of growth is predominantly related to the opening of the new capacity in Hong Kong and Vietnam, which increased the underlying costs and saw a reduction in the region’s utilisation rate. As the new capacity is filled the Asia region will see operational leverage and EBITDA will grow. Group central costs reduced by 4.5% to £10.5m (2017: £11.0m) in the year ended 31 August 2018.

Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. The governance of a jointly controlled entity is established by contractual agreement which requires the venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. Therefore, the Group has joint control of the entities’ activities. The equity method is used to account for the jointly controlled entity. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.

The growth has been funded from operating cash flow and short and long term borrowings (see note 19). Future growth will be funded from suitable financing arrangements as well as cash flows generated from operations. The information disclosed in the Strategic Report explains the Directors’ assessment of risk within the Group. The Group is structured to enable sharing of resources where possible, including banking arrangements and liquid assets between Group companies. The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage these business risks in the current economic climate. On 25 October 2018, in conjunction with the acquisition of the Group by Jacobs Holding AG, the Group has refinanced the majority of its debt. New bank facilities were drawn totaling £652 million which enabled the Group to settle certain liabilities which were outstanding at 31 August 2018 including the Senior Secured Loan Notes, Revolving Credit Facilities and Forward Currency Contracts along with local debt in Hong Kong. The new bank debt available at the date of this report consisted of a term loan facility totaling £450 million which is repayable in October 2025 and a bridge loan of £225 million which is repayable in October 2026. In addition to this, there is a Revolving Credit Facility of £100 million which has a termination date of April 2025. Management are considering replacing the £225 million bridge facility with new Loan Notes between the date of signing these financial statements and the end of the financial year. The Directors have performed a review of the Group’s cash flows up to 30 November 2019 and have a reasonable expectation that the business has adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The principal accounting policies are set out below. They have remained unchanged from the previous year.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. _Non-financial assets_ The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition and subsequently at each reporting date. Indications of impairment are identified by reviewing events or changes in circumstance which suggest that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is deemed to be the higher of net realisable value (fair value less costs to sell) and value in use. Value in use is calculated by discounting estimated future post-tax cash flows to their present value using a post-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The discount rate applied is based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group’s operations in the country the asset sits. Estimated future cash flows are based on Board approved budgets and mid-term plans which represent our best estimate of future performance, supported by historical trends, known operating margins and achievable growth or cost saving targets.

The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cashgenerating units (“CGU”). Impairment testing is performed at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Therefore a CGU represents an individual school or group of schools purchased as one business acquisition transaction. No individual CGUs are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying value of goodwill. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses in respect of a CGU are initially allocated against the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the units and then subsequently against the carrying amounts of other assets within the CGU. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are irreversible. Impairment losses recognised against other assets can be subsequently reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are therefore assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. _Multi-employer plans_ The Group participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (“the TPS”), in respect of certain teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan and it is not possible for the Group to use defined benefit accounting as sufficient information is not available. Accordingly, no provision can be made for any under or over provision of funding within the plan as required under IAS 19 and the scheme is therefore accounted for in the same way as if it were a defined contribution plan. For further detail on the TPS see note 23. _Short-term benefits_ Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. _Share based payment transactions_ Share based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share based transactions are set out in note 9.

Early application is permitted. The key change for the Group arising from IFRS 9 is in the requirement to use an expected loss model for recognition of bad debt provisions across the whole Group, however, the impact on the Group is not expected to be material. IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ deals with revenue recognition and focuses on the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and its related cash flows. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and is effective for the year ending 31 August 2019. Early application is permitted. The adoption of IFRS 15 will change the timing of revenue recognition with tuition and associated fees being recognised on a term time basis instead of the current policy of being recognised evenly over the year. Management’s latest estimate of the impact of adopting IFRS 15 in the year ending 31 August 2019 is that it will decrease revenue by c. £1m. The increase in opening deferred revenue as at 1 September 2018 and the corresponding debit to equity reserve has not yet been finalised but is estimated to be in the region of £1-5m. IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ considers the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and also deals with the disclosure of useful information relating to leasing activities. The standard replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and a key change is that most operating leases, held by lessees, will be accounted for on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 is effective for the year ending 31 August 2020, with early adoption permitted, as long as the standard is not adopted prior to IFRS 15. The full financial consequences of adopting IFRS 16 are being calculated by management but are expected to be material. On transition to the new standard, the Group will derecognise certain balances associated with IAS 17, including prepaid and accrued rent, onerous lease provisions and recognise a new right of use asset offset by a lease liability.

Shortly before the acquisition, three new companies were set up in order to acquire the trade and assets and equity interests of the business. Woodland Pre-Schools is a group of nine nurseries with c. 2,000 students which each comprise a pre-school and a playgroup. It is the largest international pre-school chain in Hong Kong, providing education to students aged 2 to 6 years. The acquisition is expected to increase Cognita’s market share in Hong Kong and provide a feeder into the Stamford American School, Hong Kong. In the period from acquisition to 31 August 2018, the Woodland Pre-Schools contributed £4,917,000 of revenue and £87,000 profit to the consolidated net loss for the year.

Non-underlying items are items of income or expenditure which for the Board and financial statement reporting purposes are disclosed separately because in management’s judgement, due to their nature, size or incidence, they distort an understanding of the Group’s financial performance and comparability between periods. The items of expenditure which management designate as being non-underlying include acquisition and business exploration costs, restructuring costs, impairments of assets, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets and share based payment schemes. Impairment costs relate to the write down of assets identified as being impaired. Each year all CGUs and their associated assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment. If identified as being impaired, an impairment charge will be made to the income statement. The impairment charge for an individual CGU, which does not result in a cash cost to the business, is generally one-off in nature and, therefore, is not considered to be a recurring item. In the event that an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the reversal is treated consistently with the initial write down and would be recognised within non-underlying items. Acquisition and business exploration costs are expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or expansion opportunities including future business development into new countries and regions. These include any legal and due diligence fees relating to potential or actual acquisitions as well as losses incurred prior to the opening of new schools. Although costs relating to projects can span multiple financial years, key components of expenditure for specific projects are non-recurring, for example financial due diligence, legal due diligence, and market surveys. These costs have no relation to the operational results of existing schools and are split out to enable the reader of the financial statements to gain greater clarity of the underlying business performance. Restructuring costs mainly relate to employment cessation and associated legal costs. These costs are incurred annually but relate to different projects and by their nature will only occur once. Share based payment costs represent the income statement charge relating to the management incentive plan (MIP). This charge relates to the MIP put in place in June 2013, described in note 9. This charge does not result in a cash cost to the business and has therefore been shown as non-underlying. All accounting policies are applied consistently between periods unless disclosures are made in the financial statements to the effect that there has been an accounting policy change, in which case, the impact of such change on the comparative numbers will be disclosed. The tax effect of the non-underlying costs in 2018 was a credit of £203,000 (2017: £449,000).",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The Group undertook a full review of the MIP during the year ended 31 August 2016 and identified that a number of the participants had left employment. As a result, the charge relating to these employees was accelerated such that the full remaining fair value had been recognised through the Consolidated Income Statement of the Group and has been treated as non-underlying. The vesting period was also reviewed and updated leading to an expected vesting period of 7 years and 3 months from the date of the initial issuance in June 2013. A number of new participants were granted shares in the incentive plan in the year ended 31 August 2016. The nature and rewards attached to the C shares granted remain consistent with the initial issuance in the year ended 31 August 2013.

The terms associated with these shares under the MIP are consistent with those relating to the C shares. Valuations were performed by an independent third party at each of the grant dates during the year. Due to the complex features of the awards, the fair value of these shares at the grant date were derived using an approach called Quadrature. The following assumptions applied in determining the fair value: - An assumed equity value was estimated at grant date - A realisation event was assumed to occur at 31 August 2020 - A risk free rate of return ranging from 0.66% to 1.14%, depending on grant date was used for modelling purposes - A future volatility rate of 43% was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable public companies adjusted for unique or significant events not expected to affect future volatility - An annual employee exit rate of 0% has been factored into the assumptions, as shares are transferred to other participants F-180 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The carrying value of the leased assets as at 31 August 2018 was £23,175,000 (2017: £12,500,000). Following the partial disposal of the Chilton Cantelo school buildings in June 2017, the remaining buildings have been transferred to assets held for sale. The sale of the buildings is considered highly probable and they are being actively marketed. As at 31 August 2018, the total amount classified as assets held for sale was £608,000 (2017: £608,000), being the net book value of the property prior to its transfer to assets held for sale. Certain subsidiary undertakings are guarantors over Senior Secured Loan Notes which are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF Market. Under this arrangement, the assets of these subsidiary undertakings are subject to a fixed and floating charge.

F-135 ----- The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. _Classification of Singapore land lease—decommission liability_ The Group has entered into two land leases in Singapore, upon which school buildings have been constructed. Note 28 describes the reinstatement clauses included in the lease contracts. Significant judgement is required in determining the likelihood that reinstatement of the land will be required upon expiry of the lease. In making its judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingent liabilities set out in IAS 37. Following this work management are satisfied that reinstatement costs are not probable and therefore it is most appropriate to disclose a contingent liability in the financial statements. Consequently an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the building and restoring the site to its original state at the end of the lease term has been obtained. _Revenue recognition—Development/facility fees_ The Group recognises development and facility fees over the tenure or expected tenure of a student within a school. The Group’s management determines the estimated tenure of a student in order to recognise development and facility fee revenue over the period of service provision. The estimated tenure is calculated on a school by school basis using an analytical method based on historical statistics, adjusted for known or anticipated trends. In making its judgement to apply this recognition basis, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue in the context of linked transactions set out in IAS 18 Revenue, in particular, the considerations surrounding the length of service provision. Estimates made by management regarding the calculation of tenure or expected tenure are discussed below.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The valuation of the share based payments is performed by an independent third party and involves the use of some significant estimates. The key estimate which has a material impact on the resulting valuation of the share based payments is the underlying equity valuation of the Group. This has been estimated by management and leads to a total valuation of the shares issued during the year of £22,386,000 (2017: nil). The resulting charge in the income statement for the year ending 31 August 2018 was £14,793,000 (2017: £245,000). The valuation of the share based payments is extremely sensitive to changes in the equity valuation and a reasonably possible change in the EV/EBITDA multiple of +/- 0.5x would cause the share based payment valuation to range from £20,740,000 to £24,270,000. _Impairment of goodwill_ The Group is required to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually. This requires the Group to calculate the value in use of each CGU to which goodwill has been allocated by estimating its future cash flows and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Management’s estimation of the future cash flows of each CGU is based on the Group’s long term plan, adjusted to remove development capex and the positive results impact of this spend. Discount rates are specific to each country of operation. The total goodwill impairment charge for the year was £9,492,000 (2017: £107,000). F-65 ----- The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below. _Share based payments_ In accordance with IFRS 2, share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The valuation requires a number of assumptions to be made based on factors outside the Group’s control, such as vesting period and employee leavers. _Fair value of assets and liabilities attributable to business combinations_ All business acquisitions made following the transition to IFRS are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 which requires that all assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition. In addition the Group performs a purchase price allocation for each acquisition which identified the separable intangible assets acquired as part of each business combination. To establish the fair value of these separable intangible assets, the Group has to make assumptions in relation to the potential future cash flows relating to these assets which involved assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates and the useful life of such assets. _Impairment of goodwill_ The Group is required to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually. This requires the Group to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Management’s estimation of cash flows is based upon the current budgets and forecasts which are established using management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The estimation of discount rate is considered on a case by case basis and is achieved using a number of different methodologies which consider current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.

Consequently, Group Adjusted EBITDA (including 100% of joint venture Adjusted EBITDA) is considered the most relevant metric for information purposes. Student numbers increased (including the impact of acquisitions) by 5.0% in the year, with Europe growing by 4.3%, Asia by 5.9% and Latin America by 5.3%. The Europe student growth was partially offset by a decrease in student numbers in Chilton Cantelo, Cranbrook (closed in the year ended 31 August 2016) and Sackville (sold in the year ended 31 August 2017) schools in the United Kingdom. Asia student growth was mostly driven by the Dusit acquisition in Thailand in 2016 and continued growth in Stamford American School in Singapore and in ISHCMC in Vietnam. The growth of 5.3% in Latin America is largely due to the ongoing growth in the Chile schools with new capacity and the bilingual programme continuing to drive enrolments. Group revenue (including 100% of the St Nicholas joint venture) increased from £330.9m in 2016 to £389.7m in 2017, an increase of 17.8% or 8.6% on a constant currency basis. Revenue attributable to new acquisitions during the year ended 31 August 2017 represented 8.6% of the increase on a constant currency basis, with the remainder due to the organic increase in student numbers and annual fee inflation. Regional Group Adjusted EBITDA grew by 19.2% (8.0% on a constant currency basis) and represents a margin of 21.8% of revenue (2016: 21.5%). Much of this increase was derived from organic growth of 13.2% in the Asia region driven by a strong growth in all countries in the region utilising available capacity. The Asia Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew 29.9% (13.9% on a constant currency basis) on revenues that grew by 23.5% (9.3% on a constant currency basis) in the same period. The 17.7% organic growth rate in Latin America, on a constant currency basis, was driven by a 0.5ppt improvement in the utilisation rates from 76.4% to 76.9% in the year ended 31 August 2017. The improvement in EBITDA has been most notable in Chile where a new bilingual programme continues to grow and has led to improved margins. Europe Regional Adjusted EBITDA of £26.5m fell 1.2% (fell 18.3% on an organic basis) during the year, driven by lower EBITDA in the UK as a result of targeted investment in the educational provision and higher national insurance contributions. The EBITDA in Spain was impacted by two additional sites in Madrid for Hastings school which will drive growth in future years. Group central costs grew 12.4% to £11.0m in the year ended 31 August 2017. This increase was primarily due to the full year impact following the transition of the executive management team.

Whilst the timing and nature of the UK’s separation from the EU remain unclear, management have identified some areas of potential business impact which they will keep under review as events unfold. _Currency exposure: Fluctuations in exchange rates will impact Group results which are reported in pounds_ sterling. Approximately 64% of Group revenue, 80% of Group EBITDA and 92% of Group capital expenditure are denominated in foreign currency. The Group has entered into forward exchange contracts in respect of the Notes as disclosed in the final section of this report. _Student and staffing recruitment and retention: The potential impact on London’s status as a financial centre may_ affect demand for international schools. However, the weakening of the pound sterling against other major currencies may make Cognita’s UK independent schools more competitive internationally as tuition fees become more affordable for foreign families looking to educate their children in the UK. A further consideration is that attracting and retaining students and teachers from the EU may become more difficult if visa entry requirements become more stringent. _Regulatory changes: Cognita will be working closely with the National Association of British Schools in Spain,_ the Council of British International School and the British Council to review the impact of Brexit, if any, on the use of British qualifications for Spanish university entry and on Spanish students applying to British universities. Management’s view is that the Group’s diverse global portfolio and the robust nature of the education sector will provide resilience against the uncertainties faced during the Brexit transition period.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. The governance of a jointly controlled entity is established by contractual agreement which requires the venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. Therefore, the Group has joint control of the entities’ activities. The equity method is used to account for the jointly controlled entity. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.

The growth has been funded from operating cash flow and short and long term borrowings (see note 19). Future growth will be funded from suitable financing arrangements as well as cash flows generated from operations. The information disclosed in the Strategic Report explains the Directors’ assessment of risk within the Group. The Group is structured to enable sharing of resources where possible, including banking arrangements and liquid assets between Group companies. The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage these business risks in the current economic climate. The Directors have performed a review of the Group and have a reasonable expectation that the business has adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future.

For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Group. i) Foreign currency transactions In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. ii) Foreign operations For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency at foreign exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve, attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate. Exchange differences arising from monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.

A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. _Non-financial assets_ The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition and subsequently at each reporting date. Indications of impairment are identified by reviewing events or changes in circumstance which suggest that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is deemed to be the higher of net realisable value (fair value less costs to sell) and value in use. Value in use is calculated by discounting estimated future post-tax cash flows to their present value using a post-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The discount rate applied is based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group’s operations in the country the asset sits. Estimated future cash flows are based on Board approved budgets which represent our best estimate of future performance, supported by historical trends, known operating margins and achievable growth or cost saving targets. An inflationary growth rate of 2.25% was used to extrapolate beyond the most recent forecasts for all regions with the exclusion of Brazil where 4.95% was used, representing the inflation rate for the business based on latest economic information. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).

Therefore a CGU represents an individual school or group of schools purchased as one business acquisition transaction. No individual CGU’s are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying value of goodwill. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses in respect of a CGU are initially allocated against the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the units and then subsequently against the carrying amounts of other assets within the CGU. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are irreversible. Impairment losses recognised against other assets can be subsequently reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are therefore assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. _Multi-employer plans_ The Group participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (“the TPS”), in respect of certain teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan and it is not possible for the Group to use defined benefit accounting as sufficient information is not available. Accordingly, no provision can be made for any under or over provision of funding within the plan as required under IAS 19 and the scheme is therefore accounted for in the same way as if it were defined contribution. For further detail on the TPS see note 22. _Short-term benefits_ Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. _Share based payment transactions_ Share based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share based transactions are set out in note 9. The fair-value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with the corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Each year all CGU’s and their associated assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment. If identified as being impaired, an impairment charge will be made to the income statement. The impairment charge for an individual CGU, which does not result in a cash cost to the business, is generally one-off in nature and, therefore, is not considered to be a recurring item. In the event that an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the reversal is treated consistently with the initial write down and would be recognised within non-underlying items. During the year, the Group impaired two schools within the Europe operating segment. Acquisition and business exploration costs are expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or expansion opportunities including future business development into new countries and regions. These include any legal and due diligence fees relating to potential or actual acquisitions as well as losses incurred prior to the opening of new schools. Although costs relating to projects can span multiple financial years, key components of expenditure for specific projects are non-recurring, for example financial due diligence, legal due diligence, and market surveys. These costs have no relation to the operational results of existing schools and are split out to enable the reader of the financial statements to gain greater clarity of the underlying business performance. Restructuring costs mainly relate to employment cessation and associated legal costs. These costs are incurred annually but relate to different projects and by their nature will only occur once. During the year ended 31 August 2016, two schools were closed in the UK with costs of £2.2m relating to the closures disclosed within this category. Share based payment costs represent the income statement charge relating to the management incentive plan (MIP). This charge relates to the MIP put in place in June 2013, described in note 9. This charge does not result in a cash cost to the business and has therefore been shown as non-underlying. All accounting policies are applied consistently between periods unless disclosures are made in the financial statements to the effect that there has been an accounting policy change, in which case, the impact of such change on the comparative numbers will be disclosed. The tax effect of the non-underlying costs in 2017 was a credit of £449,000 (2016: £262,000).",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

As a result, the charge relating to these employees was accelerated such that the full remaining fair value had been recognised through the Consolidated Income Statement of the Group and was treated as non-underlying. In the year, the vesting period remained unchanged with an anticipated vesting date in 2020. A number of new participants were granted shares in the incentive plan in the year ended 31 August 2016. The nature and rewards attached to the C shares granted remain consistent with the initial issuance in the year ended 31 August 2013. New participants to the MIP scheme in the year ended 31 August 2016, were also eligible to acquire B shares in Cognita Topco Limited, these shares rank pari passu with one another and entitle the B shareholders to participate in the profits of the Company. The terms associated with these shares under the MIP are consistent with those relating to the C shares. Valuations were performed by an independent third party at each of the grant dates. Due to the complex features of the awards, the fair value of these shares at the grant date were derived using an approach called Quadrature. The following assumptions applied in determining the fair value: - An assumed equity value was estimated at grant date - A realisation event was assumed to occur at 31 August 2020 - A risk free rate of return ranging from 0.66% to 1.14%, depending on grant date was used for modelling purposes - A future volatility rate of 43% was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable public companies adjusted for unique or significant events not expected to affect future volatility - An annual employee exit rate of 0% has been factored into the assumptions, as shares are transferred to other participants",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are discount and growth rates. The Group considers that all CGU’s operate in a similar sector being education, but acknowledge that the countries in which the Group operates need to be considered in the calculation of discount rate. Therefore this year’s impairment reviews adopted discount rates ranging between 9.4% and 14.6%. For all CGU’s a growth rate of 2.25% is applied with the exclusion of those in Brazil where a rate of 4.95% was used. F-117 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Impairment calculations are, however, more sensitive to changes in the discount rate.

The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and by investing cash assets safely and profitably. The Group’s policy has been to ensure continuity of funding and where possible has relocated debt closer to operational activities in appropriate local currencies. During the year ended 31 August 2015, the Group refinanced all debt other than that held in Brazil and Chile. As part of this refinancing, on 21 July 2015 Cognita Bondco Parent Limited and Cognita Midco Limited were inserted between Cognita Topco Limited and Cognita Holdings Limited. Other new companies were also incorporated including Cognita Financing plc which issued Senior Secured Loan Notes of £280m. On 4 October 2016, an additional £45m of Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued via a private placement at a premium of £2.0m to par value. The Group issued an additional £50m of Senior Secured Loan Notes on 8 May 2017 via a private placement. These Notes, which carry the same maturity and fixed interest rate of 7.75% were issued under the same indenture as the initial issuance. A premium of £2.25m to par value was recognised upon the issuance of these instruments. The Senior Secured Loan Notes mature on 15 August 2021 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 7.75%. The issue has been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF (“Multilateral Trading Facility”). The Group secured a £60m Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility to fund future borrowing requirements which can be drawn down in a number of different currencies as required. During the year ended 31 August 2016 the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility was increased by £20m to £80m with a further increase of £20m in September 2016, bringing the total facility to £100m. The Group has a strong working capital position as student contracts require cash payment in advance of tuition services, generally on an annual, termly or monthly basis. Trade payables are settled on the basis of credit terms agreed with the respective suppliers. F-129 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

Note 28 describes the reinstatement clauses included in the lease contracts. Significant judgement is required in determining the likelihood that reinstatement of the land will be required upon expiry of the lease. In making its judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingent liabilities set out in IAS 37. Following this work, management are satisfied that reinstatement costs are not probable and therefore it is most appropriate to disclose a contingent liability in the financial statements. Consequently an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the building and restoring the site to its original state at the end of the lease term has been obtained. _Revenue recognition—Development/facility fees_ The Group recognises development and facility fees over the tenure or expected tenure of a student within a school. The Group’s management determines the estimated tenure of a student in order to recognise development and facility fee revenue over the period of service provision. The estimated tenure is calculated on a school by school basis using an analytical method based on historical statistics, adjusted for known or anticipated trends. In making its judgement to apply this recognition basis, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue in the context of linked transactions set out in IAS 18 Revenue, in particular, the considerations surrounding the length of service provision. Estimates made by management regarding the calculation of tenure or expected tenure are discussed below. _Provisions_ The Group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date. The amount of provision recognised is dependent upon management’s estimation of the likely outcome. At the balance sheet date, provisions included amounts for lease dilapidations, employee termination and other specific provisions. Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis, according to management’s best current estimates and are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent estimates and assumptions required upon the recognition of a provision, the amount required to settle a provision can be different to the provision recognised at the balance sheet date. _Recoverability of trade receivables_ An estimation is required to determine the recoverability of fees receivable when collection of the full amount is not considered virtually certain. At the balance sheet date, all schools assess the recoverability of trade receivables and record a provision for doubtful debts based on knowledge of individual circumstances as well as historic empirical evidence of recoverability based on relative ageing of fees receivable. Where there is evidence that a fee will not be recovered, the fee receivable asset will be derecognised and a bad debt charge will be recognised in the income statement. Due to the use of estimates, sometimes there will be a difference between amounts collected in future periods related to fees receivable recognised at the balance sheet date. The difference between the carrying amount of the fee receivable on the balance sheet and the amount actually collected in a future period is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Deferred tax assets_ In order to determine the recoverability and therefore recognition of deferred tax assets, the Group must estimate the probable future taxable profits, against which the temporary timing differences can be utilised. This estimate requires the use of current budgets and forecasts to determine future taxable profits and the timing of when these will be realised. Management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date and if it is considered probable that all, or a part of the deferred tax asset will not be utilised within 5 years, the asset is derecognised.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The Group’s current assessment of the agreement is that uncertainty remains around the timing of the crystallisation of the obligation and therefore the contractual commitment, currently estimated at £6.4m, and remains a contingent liability for accounting purposes.

An assessment was undertaken prior to the decision to begin a consultation process, which identified that the student numbers at each of the schools had reduced to a level whereby the breadth of education would be compromised from the next academic year. Student numbers at both schools have significantly reduced in recent years, due to changes in the market dynamics in each of the school catchments, despite the Group’s continued investment in improving facilities and expanding educational provision. After exploring all the available options, the consultation process concluded and the closure announcement was made in March 2016. At the beginning of the consultation process, the school had a combined total of c.390 students. The losses incurred by both schools in aggregate in the year to 31 August 2016 were £4.5m.

Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. The governance of a jointly controlled entity is established by contractual agreement which requires the venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. Therefore the Group has joint control of the entities activities. The equity method is used to account for the jointly controlled entity. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.

A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. _Non-financial assets_ The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition and subsequently at each reporting date. Indications of impairment are identified by reviewing events or changes in circumstance which suggest that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is deemed to be the higher of net realisable value (fair value less costs to sell) and value in use. Value in use is calculated by discounting estimated future post-tax cash flows to their present value using a post-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The discount rate applied is based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group’s operations in the country the asset sits. Estimated future cash flows are based on Board approved budgets which represent our best estimate of future performance, supported by historical trends, known operating margins and achievable growth or cost saving targets. An inflationary growth rate of 2.25% was used to extrapolate beyond the most recent forecasts, representing the inflation rate for the business based on latest economic information. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cashgenerating units (“CGU”). Impairment testing is performed at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Therefore a CGU represents an individual school or group of schools purchased as one business acquisition transaction. No individual CGU’s are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying value of goodwill. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss in recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses in respect of a CGU are initially allocated against the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the units and then subsequently against the carrying amounts of other assets within the CGU. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are irreversible. Impairment losses recognised against other assets can be subsequently reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are therefore assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

At the year end the Group operated 67 (2015: 66) schools across Europe, Asia and Latin America. The Directors consider these three segments as the Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8. This segmental analysis shows the results of these divisions. Revenue is income earned by the Group from third parties and is stated net of intersegmental revenue, in line with the reports reviewed by the chief decision makers. Intersegmental revenue mainly includes management charges. The Group analyses its results at Adjusted EBITDA level on an underlying basis with separate disclosure of non-underlying costs in arriving at its results before tax. Adjusted EBITDA is the performance measure observed by the chief decision makers and is defined as underlying operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges. Profit/loss before tax is not reviewed on an operating segment basis by the chief decision makers, therefore a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Profit/loss before tax is shown below for completeness.

The items of expenditure which management designate as being non-underlying include acquisition and business exploration costs, restructuring and exceptional advisory costs, impairments of assets, profit and losses on disposal of fixed assets and share based payment schemes. Impairment costs relate to the write down of assets identified as being impaired. Each year all CGU’s and their associated assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment, if identified as being impaired, an impairment charge will be made to the income statement. The impairment charge for an individual CGU, which does not result in a cash cost to the business, is generally one-off in nature and therefore is not considered to be a recurring item. In the event that an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the reversal is treated consistently with the initial write down and would be recognised within non-underlying items. Acquisition and business exploration costs are expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or expansion opportunities including future business development into new countries and regions. These include any legal and due diligence fees relating to potential or actual acquisitions. Although costs relating to projects can span multiple financial years, key components of expenditure for specific projects are non-recurring, for example financial due diligence, legal due diligence, market surveys. These costs have no relation to the operational results of existing schools and are split out to enable the reader of the financial statements to gain greater clarity of the underlying business performance. Restructuring costs mainly relate to employment cessation and associated legal costs. These costs are incurred annually but relate to different projects and by nature will only occur once. Exceptional advisory costs relate to advisory fees with respect to the review and assessment of the Group’s child safeguarding policies and procedures. During the year ended 31 August 2016, two schools were closed in the UK. Costs of £2.2m relating to the closures are disclosed within this category. Share based payment costs represent the income statement charge relating to the management incentive plan (MIP). This charge relates to the MIP put in place in June 2013, described in note 9. This charge does not result in a cash cost to the business and has therefore been shown as non-underlying. All accounting policies are applied consistently between periods unless disclosures are made in the financial statements to the effect that there has been an accounting policy change, in which case, the impact of such change on the comparative numbers will be disclosed. The tax effect of the non-underlying costs in 2016 was a credit of £262,400 (2015: £334,200). F-177 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The adjustment has no impact on the net book value and no impact in the consolidated income and other comprehensive statement of comprehensive income statement. Goodwill and other intangible assets are spread across the Group’s regions. The carrying value of intangible assets is monitored by reference to Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”). A CGU is typically a school or limited company for non-school business units. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are discount and growth rates. The Group considers that all CGU’s operate in a similar sector being education, but acknowledge that the countries in which the Group operates need to be considered in the calculation of discount rate. Therefore this year’s impairment reviews adopted discount rates ranging between 8.7% and 18.0%. For all CGU’s a growth rate of 2.25% is applied. The Group monitors its post-tax weighted average Cost of Capital and those of its competitors using market data. In considering the discount rates applied to the CGU’s, the Directors have considered the relative sizes and risks of its CGUs. The impairment reviews use a discount rate adjusted for pre-tax cash flows. As part of the review for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill in two schools in Brazil were identified as being impaired and an adjustment of £6,628,000 (period ended 31 August 2015: £nil) was made by the Group to write down the value of intangible consolidated goodwill.

Therefore, any adverse movement in a key assumption would lead to further impairment in the UK and Brazil CGU’s. The sensitivity of goodwill carrying values to possible changes in key assumptions has been performed on the remaining CGU’s in the UK and Brazil. In the UK, an increase in discount rate of 0.4% (2015: 1.5%) and a decrease in growth rate of 0.5 % (2015: 1.9%) would be required for the carrying value of further CGU’s to equal their recoverable amount.

The credit risk associated with bank balances is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

The Group’s policy has been to ensure continuity of funding and where possible has relocated debt closer to operational activities in appropriate local currencies. During the period ended 31 August 2015, the Group refinanced all debt other than that held in Brazil and Chile. As part of this refinancing, on 21 July 2015 Cognita Bondco Parent Limited and Cognita Midco Limited were inserted between Cognita Topco Limited and Cognita Holdings Limited. Other new companies were also incorporated including Cognita Financing plc which issued Senior Secured Loan Notes of £280m. The Group secured a £60m Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility to fund future borrowing requirements which can be drawn down in a number of different currencies as required. During the year ended 31 August 2016 the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility was increased by £20m to £80m. The Senior Secured Loan Notes mature on 15 August 2021 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 7.75%. The issue has been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF (“Multilateral Trading Facility”). The net proceeds were used to invest in equity of Cognita Holdings Limited and these funds were used to repay a number of outstanding external loans within the Group along with related accrued interest and break costs, to settle costs related to the termination of interest rate swaps and pay fees and expenses in connection with the transactions. The Group has a strong working capital position as student contracts require cash payment in advance of tuition services, generally on an annual, termly or monthly basis.

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. _Impairment of goodwill_ The Group is required to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually. This requires the Group to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Management’s estimation of cash flows is based upon the current budgets and forecasts which are established using management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The estimation of discount rate is considered on a case by case basis and is achieved using a number of different methodologies which consider current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU. _Provisions_ The Group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date. The amount of provision recognised is dependent upon management’s estimation of the likely outcome. At the balance sheet date, provisions included amounts for lease dilapidations and employee termination. Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis, according to management’s best current estimates and are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent estimates and assumptions required upon the recognition of a provision, the amount required to settle a provision can be different to the provision recognised at the balance sheet date. _Recoverability of trade receivables_ An estimation is required to determine the recoverability of fees receivable when collection of the full amount is not considered virtually certain. At the balance sheet date, all schools assess the recoverability of trade receivables and records a provision for doubtful debts based on knowledge of individual circumstances as well as historic empirical evidence of recoverability based on relative ageing of fees receivable. Where there is evidence that a fee will not be recovered, the fee receivable asset will be derecognised and a bad debt charge will be recognised in the income statement. Due to the use of estimates, sometimes there will be a difference between amounts collected in future periods related to fees receivable recognised at the balance sheet date. The difference between the carrying amount of the fee receivable on the balance sheet and the amount actually collected in a future period is recognised in the consolidated statement of income. _Deferred tax assets_ In order to determine the recoverability and therefore recognition of deferred tax assets, the Group must estimate the probable future taxable profits, against which the temporary timing differences can be utilised. This estimate requires the use of current budgets and forecasts to determine future taxable profits and the timing of when these will be realised. Management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date and if it is considered probable that all, or a part of the deferred tax asset will not be utilised within 5 years, the asset is derecognised.",N/A,as_expected,2018,496

The consideration, which was funded following a drawdown on the Revolving Credit Facility, was approximately €10.1m (c. £8.6m). The school is an independent British school offering education to students aged 3-18 years. The schools had c.790 students at the date of acquisition, with a current capacity of c.1,000.
