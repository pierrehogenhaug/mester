-----

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers
is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial
Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the Offering
Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these
securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for
distribution only to persons (i) who have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being
investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)
(“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) who are
outside the United Kingdom or (iv) to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within
the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of
any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must
not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to
which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons. No part of the Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received
by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us. The Offering Memorandum has been sent to
you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed
during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who
controls any of the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer, the Guarantors (each term, as defined in the Offering
Memorandum), any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or affiliates of any of the
foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference
between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and any version that will be provided to
you at a later date on request from the Initial Purchasers.

**Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of Barclays Bank PLC, Merrill Lynch International and
Goldman Sachs International (collectively, the “Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the
debt securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that (i) the target
market for such debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”), and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to, any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance
Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the
“Prospectus Directive”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the debt securities described in the attached
Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling such debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

You are reminded that this Preliminary Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you
are a person into whose possession this Preliminary Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in
accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to,


-----

deliver this Preliminary Offering Memorandum to any other person. If you receive this document by e-mail, you
should not reply by e-mail to this announcement. Any reply e-mail communications, including those you
generated by using the “Reply” function on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive this
document by e-mail, your use of this email is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to
ensure that it is free from viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

Under no circumstances shall this Preliminary Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, the notes, in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering and sale of the notes be made by
a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker
or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering of the notes shall be deemed to be made by them or such affiliate on
behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

This Preliminary Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that
documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission,
and consequently, none of the Initial Purchasers of the notes, any person who controls any of the Initial
Purchasers, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agent of theirs, respectively, or any affiliate
of any of the foregoing persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference
between the Preliminary Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version
available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED NOVEMBER 23, 2018**


**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**IN THE UNITED STATES**

## Lernen Bondco Plc


**€255,300,000** **% Senior Notes due 2026**

Lernen Bondco Plc (the “Issuer”), a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, is offering €255,300,000
aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on
each and, commencing on, 2019. The Notes will mature on, 2026. The Issuer will issue the Notes to
refinance indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facility (as defined herein) as part of the financing of the Acquisition by Lernen Bidco
Limited, the direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer, of all of the outstanding shares of Cognita Topco Limited (the “Target”), the
indirect parent of Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (the “Company” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”).


Prior to, 2021, some or all of the Notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date and a “make-whole” premium, as described in this
offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after, 2021,
at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In
addition, prior to, 2021, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, no more than 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with
the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings.

The Notes may also be redeemed at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable
tax law. Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined herein), the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of the repurchase.

The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness
of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank senior in right of payment to any and all existing and
future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment of the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated
basis (the “Notes Guarantees”) (a) on the Issue Date, by Lernen Bidco Limited (the “Issue Date Guarantor”) and (b) subject to the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined herein), no later than 120 days after the Acquisition Completion Date (as defined herein) by certain subsidiary
guarantors that are borrowers or guarantors under the Senior Facilities (as defined herein) (the “Post-Completion Date Guarantors,” and
together with the Issue Date Guarantor, the “Guarantors” and each a “Guarantor”). The Notes Guarantees will be subordinated in right of
payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor (including its guarantee of the Senior Facilities (as defined herein)) and
will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes Guarantees. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and obligations of any subsidiary
of the Issuer that does not guarantee the Notes, including obligations owed to trade creditors.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured on a second ranking basis, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), over the shares in Lernen Bidco Limited held by the Issuer and any
intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by Lernen Bidco Limited (together, the “Notes Collateral”). Pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the Notes Collateral, the holders of the Notes and all other indebtedness ranking pari passu with
the Notes will receive proceeds from the Notes Collateral only after creditors of certain existing and future senior indebtedness of the Target
Group (including, but not limited to, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined herein)). The validity and enforceability of
the Notes Guarantees and the security and liability of each Guarantor and security provider will be subject to certain limitations, for a
description of the terms of the Notes, the Notes Collateral and the Notes Guarantees, see “Description of the Notes.”

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
“Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List (the “Official List”) of The International Stock Exchange
(the “Exchange”). No application has been made for the Notes to be listed on any other stock exchange. There is no assurance that the Notes
will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be
maintained.

**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 30.**


**The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or**
**the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers**
**in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby**

**provided by Rule 144A. The Notes are not transferable except in accordance with the restrictions described under “Transfer**

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

THE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT AND MAY NOT BE

INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL
RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS

No dealer, salesperson or other person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation
not contained in this Offering Memorandum and, if given or made, any such information or representation must
not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Issuer, the Guarantors, Barclays Bank PLC, Merrill Lynch
International, Goldman Sachs International, KKR Capital Markets Limited, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft,
Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Standard Chartered Bank as initial purchasers of the Notes
(the “Initial Purchasers”). This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer of any securities other than
those to which it relates or an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, to any person in any jurisdiction
where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Neither the delivery of this Offering Memorandum nor
any sale made under it shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in the
affairs of the Issuer or the Guarantors since the date of this Offering Memorandum or that the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum is correct as of any time subsequent to that date.

By receiving this Offering Memorandum, investors acknowledge that they have had an opportunity to request for
review, and have received, all additional information they deem necessary to verify the accuracy and
completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Investors also acknowledge that they
have not relied on the Initial Purchasers in connection with their investigation of the accuracy of this information
or their decision whether to invest in the Notes. The contents of this Offering Memorandum are not to be
considered legal, business, financial, investment, tax or other advice. Prospective investors should consult their
own counsel, accountants and other advisors as to legal, business, financial, investment, tax and other aspects of
a purchase of the Notes. In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the
Issuer and the Group, the terms of the Offering and the merits and risks involved.

The Notes have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) or any other U.S. federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory
authority, nor has any such commission or regulatory authority reviewed or passed upon the accuracy or
adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw the Offering at any time and to reject any commitment to
subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers also reserve the right to allot less than the full
amount of Notes sought by investors. The Initial Purchasers and certain related entities may acquire a portion of
the Notes for their own account.

The laws of certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the offer and sale of
the Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum or any of the Notes come must inform
themselves about, and observe any such restrictions. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or their respective
representatives are making any representation to any offeree or any purchaser of the Notes regarding the legality of
any investment in the Notes by such offeree or purchaser under applicable investment or similar laws or regulations.
For a further description of certain restrictions on the Offering and sale of the Notes and the distribution of this
Offering Memorandum, see “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

To purchase the Notes, investors must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in
which investors purchase, offer or sell the Notes or possess or distribute this Offering Memorandum. Investors must
also obtain any consent, approval or permission required by such jurisdiction for investors to purchase, offer or sell
any of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which investors are subject. None of
the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will have any responsibility therefor.

No action has been taken by the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer or any other person that would permit an offering or
the circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any offering material in relation to the Issuer or
the Notes in any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.

The Notes will only be issued in fully registered form and in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). Notes sold to persons outside the U.S. in reliance on Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”) will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes,
the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the
accounts of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking SA (“Clearstream”) and registered in
the name of the nominee of the common depositary. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors accept responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Memorandum.
The Issuer and the Guarantors, and not the Initial Purchasers, have ultimate authority over the statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum, including the content of these statements and whether and how to
communicate them. To the best of the knowledge and belief of the Issuer and the Guarantors (having taken
reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this Offering Memorandum is in
accordance with the facts in all material respects and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such
information in any material respect.

Application will be made to the Authority for admission of the Notes to the Official List of the Exchange, and the
Issuer will submit this Offering Memorandum to the competent authority in connection with the listing
application. Comments by the competent authority may require significant modification or reformulation of
information contained in this offering memorandum or may require the inclusion of additional information. The
Issuer may also be required to update the information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in our
business, financial condition or results of operations and prospects. There is no assurance that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditional on obtaining this listing. Any investor or
potential investor in the European Economic Area should not base any investment decision relating to the Notes
on the information contained in this Offering Memorandum after publication of the listing particulars and should

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and, with effect from such date,
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(the “EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU as amended (“MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within

would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive. No key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them

**MIFID II product governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the type of clients to whom the Notes are targeted is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ type of clients
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**United States**

The Company and the Issuer are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. All our directors and
executive officers live outside the United States. Substantially all our and their assets are located outside the

v


-----

United States. As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Indenture, it may
be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained
in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

**England**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England is based
upon advice provided to us by U.S. and English legal advisers. The United States and England currently do not
have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such
U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England.
In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by
the U.S. court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on
such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by
an English court in such an action is conditional upon (amongst other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws
principles;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the court which pronounced it;

- the U.S. judgment being for a sum of money (whether debt or damages), but not being for payment of
money in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, a fine or other penalty;

- the U.S. court’s procedures not having breached the rules of natural justice;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment not being contrary to either public policy in England and Wales or the
United Kingdom Human Rights Act 1998;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed
as compensation for loss or damage sustained by the U.S. judgment creditor and not being otherwise in
breach of, or unenforceable under, Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not being inconsistent with a prior judgment of an English court or the court of another
jurisdiction on the same subject matter, and on the same issues in question between the same parties;

- the U.S. proceedings were brought in compliance with, or otherwise not contrary to, a jurisdiction or
arbitration agreement; and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the limitation period.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from
U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be
recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United
States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Singapore**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Singapore is based
upon advice provided to the Issuer and the Guarantors by their Singapore counsel. A U.S. Court Judgment may
not be enforced in Singapore pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act, or the
Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, or (as at the date of this Offering Memorandum), the Choice
of Court Agreements Act (as the U.S. is currently a signatory but not yet a party to the 2005 Hague Convention
on the Choice of Court Agreements). It has to be enforced by commencing a common law action for enforcement
of a foreign judgment in the Singapore courts. If and to the extent that the Singapore courts find that the U.S.
Court Judgment is an in personam final and conclusive judgment on the merits of the case against the Company,
it is for a fixed or ascertainable sum of money granted by a U.S. court which has jurisdiction over the Company
according to the conflict of laws rules determined to be applicable by the Singapore courts to determine the
subject matter of the dispute, and it has not been stayed or fully satisfied, the Singapore courts will, in principle,
grant a Singapore judgment for the sum under the foreign judgment, without substantive re-examination or
re-litigation on the merits of the judgment thereof, unless:

- the U.S. Court Judgment had been procured by fraud;

vi


-----

- the U.S. Court Judgment’s enforcement would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore;

- the U.S. Court Judgment was obtained in proceedings which were contrary to natural justice; or

- the U.S. Court Judgment was for the enforcement of foreign penal revenue, or public laws.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Information contained in this Offering Memorandum regarding markets, market size, market position, market
share, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to our business consists of estimates and data taken or
derived from various public and private sources, including a market research report (the “Market Report”)
commissioned by us and prepared by L.E.K. Consulting Pte. Ltd. (“L.E.K.”), which was produced by L.E.K.
based on publications comprising industry data, forecasts, market and customer surveys, other consultant strategy
reports and other information made available to L.E.K. by third-party data providers, industry associations,
competitors, published accounts, interviews with key market participants, primary interviews and field visits
conducted with industry experts and participants, secondary market research and internal financial and
operational information supplied by, or on behalf of, the Group, as well as information obtained from (i) third
party data providers, including Oxford Economics and Euromonitor, (ii) industry associations and (iii) publicly
available information from other sources, such as information publicly released by our competitors as well as
publicly available sources and certain operational information including a business plan supplied by or on behalf
of the Group. In certain cases, there is no readily available external information to validate market-related
analyses and estimates, necessitating reliance on internally developed estimates.

While the Issuer has compiled, extracted, reproduced or incorporated by reference market or other industry data
from external sources, including third parties, analysts or industry or general publications, the Issuer and the

viii


-----

Initial Purchasers have not independently verified that data. Subject to the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor the
Initial Purchasers can assure investors of the accuracy and completeness of, or take any responsibility for, such
data.

While the Issuer believes that its internal estimates are reasonable, such estimates have not been verified by any
independent sources, and the Issuer cannot assure potential investors as to the accuracy of such estimates or that
a third-party using different methods to assemble, analyse or compute market data would obtain the same result.
Neither the Issuer nor any third-party data provider cited in this Offering Memorandum intend to, and does not,
assume any obligations to update any data, including industry or market data, set forth in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, investors should be aware that such data in this Offering Memorandum and estimates
based on such data may not be reliable indicators of future results.

Given the high degree of fragmentation in the market and limited third party reporting upon which to base
quantitative growth assessments, there is an inherent degree of uncertainty in the Market Report and the
projections therein, and they are highly susceptible to changes. No warranties of any kind are provided in
connection with the Market Report and analyses contained therein, and parties should rely on their own due
diligence and market investigations with respect to the items discussed therein.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer was incorporated on August 28, 2018 for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer has
no material assets or liabilities (other than its shares in Lernen Bidco Limited and receivables under the
Intercompany Loan) and has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its incorporation and
participation in the Transactions. Consequently, we have not included any historical financial information
relating to the Issuer in this Offering Memorandum, other than certain limited financial data presented on a
consolidated basis “as adjusted” to reflect the Transactions. The consolidated capitalization of the Issuer is not
directly comparable to the consolidated capitalization of the Company. See “Capitalization.” See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—The Issuer is a holding company with_
_no independent operations and is dependent on payments from its operating subsidiaries in order to provide it_

facilitating the 2015 Refinancing Transactions. We have included in this Offering Memorandum and discuss
herein, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and
for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and, in each case, the related notes thereto. The use of
the term “Group,” “our,” “us” and “we” in this Offering Memorandum refers to the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended August 31,
2016, 2017 and 2018 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our consolidated financial information is
presented in Pound sterling.

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or
thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result,
the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set
forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are
calculated using the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, or the tabular
presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not
using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Average Revenue per FTE

2017 only. Following the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the joint venture on August 25, 2017, 100%
of the results of St Nicholas Preparatory School are fully consolidated in our results and are reflected in
Adjusted EBITDA.

- Group Adjusted EBITDA margin means Group Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, expressed as a

business exploration costs, restructuring costs, impairment of assets, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets,
school pre-opening expenditures and non-cash share-based payment expense.

x


-----

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain
investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.
The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have
limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios, such as Average Revenue per FTE
Student, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Regional Adjusted EBITDA, Regional
Adjusted EBITDA margin, Regional Group Adjusted EBITDA, Regional Group Adjusted EBITDA margin,
Group Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Development capital
expenditure, Operating capital expenditure, Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Conversion
Rate and non-underlying items are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not
be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the year or any other performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flows
from operating, investing or financing activities. See “—Financial Information.”

The non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the
Indenture. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements
that would be required for such replacements; and

- some of the Non-underlying items that we eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from
or developed by applying adjustments to our historical results as of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018
to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if it occurred on
August 31, 2018 with respect to balance sheet data and September 1, 2017 with respect to data derived from our
statement of comprehensive income. The unaudited adjustments are based upon available information and certain
assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and may differ materially from the actual
adjusted amounts, including available management financial statements of the entities that we intend to acquire.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not realize any or all of our anticipated pro forma
_adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA included in this Offering Memorandum.” The unaudited as adjusted financial_
information is presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited as adjusted financial information does
not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Offering
and the use of proceeds therefrom actually occurred at the beginning of the period or on the date indicated, and
they do not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any
future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in “Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto_
appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is not
intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements or IFRS.

**Certain Material Accounting Changes**

The material new standards and interpretations that are endorsed by the EU but not yet effective up to the date of
issuance our financial statements for periods covered in this Offering Memorandum are disclosed below and will
be adopted where applicable when they become effective. For a description of other accounting changes not yet
effective see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Critical Accounting Policies—Accounting standards issued but not yet effective.”_

**_IFRS 16, “Leases”_**

This standard considers the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and also deals with the
disclosure of useful information relating to leasing activities. The standard replaces IAS 17 “Leases” and a

xi


-----

key change is that most operating leases held by lessees will be accounted for on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 is
effective for the year ending August 31, 2020, with early adoption permitted, as long as the standard is not
adopted prior to IFRS 15. The full financial consequences of adopting IFRS 16 are being calculated by
management but are expected to be material. On transition to the new standard, the Group will derecognize
certain balances associated with IAS 17, including prepaid and accrued rent, onerous lease provisions and
recognize a new right of use asset offset by a lease liability. The net impact on equity is not expected to be
material. The adoption of the standard will increase Adjusted EBITDA by replacing rental charges in the income
statement with interest and depreciation charges.

**Operating Data**

Except as otherwise indicated, in this Offering Memorandum the amounts or percentages, as the case may be, of
our number of schools, full time equivalent (“FTE”) student numbers, FTE staff, capacity and utilization are
based on internal information and management estimates and are unaudited. Actual amounts and percentages
may differ from the amounts and percentages presented based on such management estimates.

- Average FTE Students mean the average of FTE students at each month’s-end during the relevant period.

- Average Revenue per FTE Student for a period is calculated by dividing the revenue from our schools for
the period (including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018) by
the average FTE students for the period.

- Average Student Capacity means the total number of students a particular school can accommodate at any
given time.

- Enrollments means average number of FTE students for any given period in a particular Cohort.

- Utilization is calculated as the average number of FTE students divided by total average capacity, expressed
as a percentage.

**Target and Future Guarantor Coverage**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain information with respect to the relative proportion of our
consolidated earnings and assets represented by the Company and the Guarantors on a combined basis (the
“Guarantor Coverage Information”). A consolidated total coverage ratio calculated on this basis does not
necessarily reflect the individual asset positions of corporate entities in the event of insolvency.

For purposes of this calculation, aggregate Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding depreciation, amortization,
impairment and non-underlying expenses back to the aggregate operating profit to the period. Aggregate
financial information differs from consolidated financial information in that aggregate financial information does
not reflect deductions for intercompany eliminations.

The Guarantor Coverage Information is subject to important limitations and investors should view the Guarantor
Coverage Information with caution. The Guarantor Coverage Information included in this Offering
Memorandum has not been audited or reviewed, has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospective Directive or any generally accepted accounting
standards and does not give effect to any normalization adjustments, annualizations or synergies such as those
applied in calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018. We cannot
assure you that the Guarantor Coverage Information will accurately reflect the relative earnings or assets of our
subsidiaries in the future.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

The Group owns or has rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that it uses in connection with
the operation of its business. We assert to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights under our
trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company
appearing in this Offering Memorandum belongs to its holder.

Solely for convenience, the trademarks, trade names and copyrights referred to in this Offering Memorandum are

**Overview**

We are a leading global operator of private-pay K-12 schools currently comprising 71 schools in 8 countries
across Asia, Europe and Latin America with a total Average Student Capacity of 50,659 places and a total
Average FTE Student Enrollment of 38,379 FTE students for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. Total
Average Student Capacity and total average enrollment increased by 17.4% and 14.2%, respectively, between the
fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2018. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, our revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA were £430.5 million and £80.3 million, respectively.

Each Cognita school has its own unique ethos, with curricula and programs tailored to the needs of the students
and parents in the market it serves. Our distinctive offerings are underpinned by our commitment to deliver on
the three primary aspects of a Cognita education: high academic standards, strong character development and a
global perspective. We offer a wide and diverse range of curricula across regions to appeal to both local and
expatriate populations, including: the British curriculum, which is based on the standardized national curriculum
for England and which, with respect to our Spain segment, is supplemented with the Spanish national curriculum;
the International Baccalaureate (“IB”), a prestigious and rigorous internationally recognized diploma program;
the American curriculum (American Education Reaches Out standard, Massachusetts state standards, the New
York state standards and the Texas state standards); the Australian national curriculum; the Brazilian national
curriculum and the Brazilian (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Brazilian national curriculum; and the
Chilean national curriculum and the Chilean (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Chilean national
curriculum. We believe that this multi-curriculum approach allows us to better serve a variety of attractive
market segments while still preserving our academic and institutional standards. All of our schools have an
English language offering. In addition, we believe that, throughout our organization, we benefit from our
established reputation for providing academic excellence, high quality teachers and appealing school facilities.

Our philosophy of providing an “Inspiring World of Education” lies at the core of each of our schools’ unique value
proposition and sets the standards by which we operate and further develop our schools. We place significant
emphasis on delivering individualized teaching and learning and providing exceptional student outcomes,
irrespective of students’ individual abilities. The majority of our schools follow a non-selective admissions policy
and we seek to support each student in achieving outcomes to the best of his or her ability through our commitment
to high standards in all aspects of teaching, care and school management. We strengthen this approach by setting
individualized learning goals which provide the right level of challenge and support for growing minds and by
implementing processes for regularly tracking and benchmarking student attainment.

We employ a systematic approach to student enrollment and retention across our platform and use our global
scale and diverse expertise to build best practice in all our school.

We operate in developed and developing markets and our success in increasing enrollment reflects the
underlying strength and favorable dynamics of these markets. The developed and many of the developing
markets in which we operate (such as Vietnam and Thailand) are characterized by stable market fundamentals,
including a large middle class and a strong and established private school presence. Our success in the
developing markets in which we operate is based, in part, on the sizeable pools of expatriate families in these
markets, the increasing wealth among local families, each of whom value and demand high quality education for
their children and the increasing demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours.

Substantially all of our revenues are from private-pay sources without exposure to changes in government
funding.

Our operations are backed by a large and attractive portfolio of well-invested and well-maintained campuses and
facilities. Our real estate portfolio comprises of 126 sites, of which 36 are owned on a freehold basis and the
remaining 90 are leasehold properties on lease terms that we believe are favorable for our operations. The

average remaining tenure with respect to our leasehold school properties is 23 years. The book value of our real
estate portfolio at cost as at August 31, 2018 was £559.6 million. See “Business—Properties” for more
information on our properties.

our operations have a strategic focus on high value, growing, gateway markets such as: Singapore, Ho Chi Minh
City (“HCMC”), Hong Kong, Bangkok, Madrid, Barcelona and London. According to the Market Report,
between academic years 2015-2018 (except for Hong Kong, which is measured from academic year 2014-2018),
Pre-K-12 revenue in these attractive segments grew at an annual CAGR as follows: Singapore (6%); HCMC
(14%); Hong Kong (10%); Bangkok (includes the Eastern Seaboard region) (8%); Madrid (7%); Barcelona
(11%) and London (6%). With existing facilities and experience in each of these gateway cities, we consider
ourselves well positioned to capture some of this market growth.

Revenue growth in the market is underpinned by high growth in private school enrollments compared to public
enrollments. According to UNESCO, in Europe there were approximately 16 million private K-12 students in
2016 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 8% from 2011 to 2017, in Latin America (including the Caribbean)
there were approximately 25 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 1%
from 2011 to 2017 and in Asia (including Central, Southern, Eastern and Southeast regions) there were
approximately 198 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 3% from 2011 to
2017. Research by Euromonitor and Oxford Economics suggests that the relevant school going population for the
private K-12 market (aged 3-17 year olds) grew by a CAGR of 0.9% across our key European and Asian markets
from 10.6 million in 2015 to 10.9 million in 2018 and is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 0.9%,
reaching 11.4 million by 2023.

Demand for our schools is driven by both local and expatriate demand. For the fiscal year ended August 31,
2018, we had approximately 75% of local students and 25% of expatriate students. The exact percentage of
expatriate students varies significantly country-by-country. Our schools in Hong Kong and Vietnam rely on
approximately 49% and 58% expatriate students, respectively, whereas our schools in Chile and Brazil entirely
rely on local demand.

_Local Demand_

The developing markets, in which our schools target local families, have seen both strong parental aspirations not
met by public education and an increase in household disposable income in recent years, which has made private
education both more affordable and more desirable for an increasing number of families. Furthermore, we
believe that demand for private education in these regions is supported by the importance that parents and
students living in non-English speaking countries place on English language fluency, which, in turn, supports

-----

demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours, most of which have an English-language
offering. Additionally, there is an increasing desire among parents for their children to study abroad at foreign
universities. This in turn drives demand for private-pay K-12 schools, such as ours, that are perceived to have a
strong record of student placements to reputed higher education institutions. Many of our schools offer college
counseling and pre-university programs. We believe that these increases in disposable income, combined with
the demand for high quality education, are key drivers of growth in student enrollment in private-pay K-12
schools in these markets.

_Expatriate Demand_
The international markets in which we serve expatriate families, including Singapore, HCMC, Hong Kong,
Bangkok, London, Barcelona and Madrid are located in countries that have experienced strong GDP growth, with
an associated increase in expatriate populations who, we believe, prioritize quality and continuity of education
for their children and seek schools that provide a similar curriculum and academic standards as schools in their
home countries.
The following table shows the annual growth in GDP between 2015 and 2018 and the estimated annual growth in
GDP between 2018 and 2023 in our key regions, according to the IMF:

Note:

(1) Includes the Eastern Seaboard region.

We expect this continued growth in GDP to result in growing expatriate populations in these countries and to
lead to increased enrollments.
In addition, many employers support expatriate education expenditure, which often takes the form of
reimbursements to parents for tuition fees, direct payment of fees to educational institutions or lump sum
payments that parents can use to pay tuition fees, if they so choose. Employer support influences demand for
high-quality education by affecting the affordability of private-pay K-12 education for expatriate families.

Enrolment Capacity

We continue to build on this platform of scale and to increase our capacity through targeted expansions in our
existing markets and deliberate entry into key strategic markets (including in new regions such as the Middle
East), including dense, high-growth emerging markets, to sustain our trajectory. This is underpinned by a datadriven approach analyzing catchment area dynamics, the supply/demand imbalance and country level macro
factors. We utilize a multi-faceted growth strategy which includes capacity expansion, acquisitions and
greenfield developments and focus on gateway cities within specific markets.

**_High quality education_**

In keeping with our philosophy of providing an “Inspiring World of Education,” we deliver a consistent,
principles-led framework for education which instils academic excellence, develops character and nurtures a
global perspective. In February 2017, we established an Education Advisory Board (“EAB”) to drive outstanding
educational practices across the Group and focus on evidence to improve academic outcomes. The EAB chaired
by Sir Kevan Collins, who is currently the Chief Executive of the Education Endowment Foundation (an
independent charity organization dedicated to the improvement of the educational attainment of underprivileged
students in English schools). The EAB’s mission is to accelerate academic improvement, build teacher capacity,
share effective best practices and establish external partnerships.

We have developed the “Cognita Way,” which is a framework we use to drive improvements at our schools and
maintain the high level of education valued by Parents through:

- _Energized Leadership: We believe that a key to driving improvement and academic success for our students_
is the academic vision of our Head Teachers. As such, we have a careful recruitment process for our school
Head Teachers. Once Head Teachers are hired, we endeavor to ensure stability over time by investing in our
leaders to inspire and share best practices they develop.

- _Personalized Learning: We focus on high quality learning in each classroom and on providing the right_
level of challenge and support for each student and we underpin this approach with data and predictive tools
to track student progress, benchmark individual student attainment and allow us to make informed decisions
based on the student’s particular situation.

- _People Growth: We view employing skilled and well-educated teachers at all of our schools as an important_
driver of the success of our product offering, and we have a professional and diligent approach to
recruitment and selection, with tailored practices specific to each region. We also invest in the professional
development of our teachers to help them to enhance their skills as well as to maintain high motivation
levels, for example, by providing career advancement prospects and the opportunity for teachers with high
potential to complete Masters programs in education. By operating as a global group, we also provide
internal opportunities to our teachers such as workplace shadowing and secondments, which may not be
available with single school operators. In addition, our global platform and Group central and regional
management teams free up school management and teachers from dealing with commercial and
administrative matters so that they have more time to focus on high quality teaching and learning.

- _Community: We actively seek to listen to and engage with the key people in each school community. We_
run a consistent system for gathering feedback across all regions through engagement with students (Voice
of Students, VoS), parents (Voice of Parents, VoP) and employees (Voice of Employees, VoE) and
utilization of CSAT tools such as Confirmit. Additionally, we work with a range of associations and
accreditation bodies and school inspectorates and engage with the global education sector through
participation in debates and conferences and partnerships with leading independent schools.

- _Innovation: We strive to maintain innovative curricula at our schools and constantly seek to implement new_
learning solutions and programs, both in the classroom, such as our full bilingual and English as an
Additional Language (EAL) programs, and outside of the classroom, such as our outdoor learning and
leadership development programs through our ALG division.

- _Brilliant Basics: We have developed systems and best-practices that are applied across our network to_
ensure that all of our schools are run according to the highest standards of safeguarding and health and
safety, allowing us to maintain accreditation and comply with local regulatory frameworks to help
streamline the operation of our schools. We have also implemented a global finance system and we are in
the process of implementing global solutions for HR, admissions and marketing.

- _International accreditations: We have received accreditations from the leading international educational_
organizations, such as Cambridge Assessment International Education, Council of International Schools,
COBIS, IB World School and NEASC. We are an outward looking organization, looking to learn from best
practices globally.

Our continued focus on high quality education has enabled our schools to achieve examination outcomes which
are generally well above the relevant national, regional or global averages for each curriculum despite the fact
that the majority of our schools are non-selective, for example:

- Over the past three years, our British curriculum schools in the United Kingdom and Spain consistently
achieved GCSE outcomes (in Math and English) significantly above the United Kingdom national average.

- Over the past five years, students at our IB curriculum schools achieved outcomes ahead of the “world
average” despite being non-selective schools, whilst the IB curriculum is, in many cases, offered by
selective schools.

- The Australian International School consistently achieves well on the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank
(“ATAR”) when compared to New South Wales. In 2017, the school had a mean ATAR score of 75.3
compared to a mean ATAR score of 70.0 for New South Wales. Additionally, 48% of AIS students gained
an ATAR score over 80 points.

- Over the past 10 years, our schools in Chile and Brazil have achieved PSU results (the standardized
university examination used in Chile) and ENEM results (the standardized university examination used in
Brazil) well above the respective national averages.

The following charts highlight our schools’ superior academic performance as compared to national and world
averages for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 with respect to the UK, Chile, Brazil and Australia and for the
last five fiscal years with respect to our IB program:

The high quality academics and student care delivered by our schools are also recognized by external school
inspections. As of August 31, 2018, every school inspected by the Independent School Inspectorate in the UK
was deemed fully compliant with regulations. In the period 2011-2017, inspections outcomes in the UK
improved significantly. In 2011, 20% of grades were outstanding, 76% good and 4% requiring improvement. In
2017, 87% of grades were outstanding and 13% good. Data following this date is not ranked in the same way as
current inspections are judging regulatory compliance. Every school inspection has been deemed fully compliant.

**_Resilient market and company performance through economic cycles_**

The private-pay K-12 education market has been resilient through the recent global economic downturn,
primarily due to the continuing demand from parents who view expenditure on their children’s education as
largely non-discretionary.

Benefiting from these market fundamentals, Cognita grew revenue consistently through and after the global
recession. Revenue increased in each in each year from £69 million in 2007 to £267 million in 2014, representing
a CAGR of 21%, with our pre-2007 portfolio (comprised of schools owned by us from the first day of the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2007 through the last day of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014) demonstrating
consistent organic annual growth with a CAGR of 5% over the period.

Our performance through downturns and negative macroeconomic events is further supported by a flexible
operating cost structure. A majority of our costs are variable and semi-variable (including staff costs) and can be
adjusted in the medium-term in the event of a downturn to preserve free cash flow and service debt. Teacher
salaries, the largest component of our cost base, typically grow in line with inflation but at a discount to fee
growth. In each of our markets our fees have grown at a premium to inflation during the last three fiscal years.

**_Significant requirements before a competitor can achieve our scale and experience_**

Our existing scale, financial resources, operational experience and deep institutional knowledge allows us to
better address certain structural hurdles in expanding in existing markets and entering new markets compared to
other operators. For instance, significant financial resources are required in order to invest in new school
facilities or to acquire existing schools. Our broad experience coupled with our strong understanding of the local
markets facilitates our ability to meet legal, financial and other requirements in securing government licenses and
regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions. Additionally, centralized expertise and local knowledge helps us
address the issue of the scarcity of real estate in key markets and the tendency of property developers and
landlords to prefer operators with a strong track record and financial resources. Our long and positive track
record and established reputation underpins our ability to recruit and retain high quality teachers, particularly in
expatriate markets. Finally, student retention driven by the preference of students to stay at the same school for
the tenure of their education is another important factor enhancing our leading position in this market as it
discourages existing students from switching to other schools.

**_Attractive financial profile with high revenue visibility and strong cash conversion/cash flow generation_**

Our business model offers exceptional near and medium-term visibility on revenues and cash flows as a result of
long admissions lead time, high retention, long average student tenure, consistent net positive churn and high
visibility on the competitive landscape. Tuition fees are prepaid and we have minimum notice periods for
students to withdraw without penalty, and we offer only limited refunds of tuition and other fees. The average
year-on-year Student Retention Rates for the last three fiscal years ended August 31, 2018, have been
approximately 74% in Asia, 85% in Europe and 90% in Latin America (84% average across our segments).
During the last three fiscal years, approximately 81% of our net tuition fee revenues were generated from
retained students. Additionally, we maintain good forward visibility on the revenue attributable to new joiners
through close monitoring of early confirmations and pipeline. Our revenue visibility enables us to make
operational adjustments, balance utilization, expand capacity and manage costs more effectively, which
facilitates an efficient use of resources.

Our revenue growth across all regions coupled with our disciplined approach to cost management has enabled us
to achieve consistent Regional Adjusted EBITDA growth from fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 to the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2018. Over this period, Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 14%. This was
achieved despite investment in regional resources to position the Group for future growth.

We had an operating cash conversion rate of 63.6% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (97.3% before
operating capital expenditure), which was driven by structurally negative working capital due to the advance
collection of tuition fees (and low levels of bad debt), which becomes increasingly favorable as enrollments
grow, and efficiently managed capital expenditure (operating capital expenditure has averaged 5.9% of Group
turnover for the three fiscal years ended August 31, 2018).

**_Strong Management Team_**

We have a highly experienced, dynamic and operationally focused management team, through the Group at both
the Group and regional level. Our management combines educational leadership with a proven track record
managing global development and expansions and integrating new acquisitions. Our senior management team
has significant experience in the education sector, and collectively, bring with them strong backgrounds in
management, marketing, human resources, real estate and finance. Our management team is supported by the
EAB in pursuing outstanding educational practices across the Group.

Our operating model is based on regionalization, whereby local school management teams, led by the Head
Teacher, focus on the provision of education and regionalized teams manage certain functions, such as human
resources, marketing and admissions, quality assurance, property and facilities management, IT systems and
some finance functions. Our central Group team is responsible for strategy, governance, finance, legal and IT and
general oversight of the Group. This allows the local school-based leadership teams, Head Teachers and
academic staff to focus on delivering academic excellence customized for the school and its catchment.

**Our Strategy**

We consistently focus on the following elements of our Group strategy to maintain our position as one of the
leading global operators of private-pay K-12 schools.

**_Continue to deliver high quality education to maintain and increase demand for our offering_**

Our aim is to become the best and most admired global schools group and to drive enrollments across our
portfolio by focusing on high quality educational outcomes and student and parent satisfaction. Academic rigor
and excellence are at the core of our value proposition to parents and students and influence all of our strategic
decisions. We intend to maintain our systematic and data-driven approach, using our global platform, systems
and experience to closely track student progress, develop individualized approaches to help students meet and
surpass expectations and ultimately obtain superior educational outcomes and improve the quality of the
provision of education in all of our schools. We continue to invest in our people who are integral to this mission
of delivering academic excellence and to develop processes that allow us to bring the benefits of our global scale
to the individual student.

We will also continue to develop a tailored educational offering, which appeals to the specific parent and student
demographic of each of our schools and focuses on personalized learning and will continue to implement
innovative approaches to education, including language development programs (such as daily Mandarin in our
Singapore schools), bilingual and English as second language curricula, unique educational experiences (such as
outdoor leadership programs and summer camps through our Active Learning Group (“ALG”) and direct
university partnerships offering college credits), high quality athletic programs and extensive co-curricular clubs
and activities.

**_Leveraging our global platform and reputation_**

We intend to continue to utilize our regionalized management approach to allow our regional and local school
management teams to focus on delivering educational excellence customized for their respective region and
school, while sharing academic and administrative best practices across all of our schools. At the same time, our
global scale provides operating leverage and economies of scale through consolidation of specialized functions
and know-how at the regional or Group level.

In addition, we intend to continue our strategy of attracting, retaining and investing in high-quality teaching
professionals by offering professional development opportunities and prospects of global mobility through our
network of schools. We will continue to support this through an active appraisal program and frequent
conversations with our teachers regarding career progression, skills, aspirations, delivery and impact. We believe
that maintaining our existing high levels of support staff, which allow our teachers to focus on the educational
needs of individual students, will enable us to maintain a high level of job satisfaction of our teachers and enable
us to recruit and retain “best-in-class” teachers.

**_Maximizing operating and financial performance_**

We continuously monitor and evaluate the operational performance of our schools and staff across our global
platform to identify opportunities for enhancement and to capitalize on embedded growth. An ongoing focus on
optimizing our marketing and admissions processes is a key feature of our strategy to increase student
enrollments and improve utilization of our platform. At the same time, we aim to place a strong emphasis on
student retention through processes designed to measure and understand churn at our schools and intervene to
ensure high levels of student and parent satisfaction.

We also seek to consistently generate fee growth above cost inflation, supported by the growing demand for
private-pay K-12 education in the markets in which we operate, our strong reputation and the quality of our
educational provision, in order to grow our revenue and increase our Adjusted EBITDA margins. We will
continue to place significant emphasis on optimizing resources to manage our costs efficiently, including
centralized or regional procurement of goods and services to benefit from economies of scale, improved
operating leverage and maintaining operational flexibility.

**_Continue to look for expansion and acquisition opportunities in existing and selected attractive and scalable_**
**_markets_**

Having successfully completed over 40 acquisitions since 2004, we are a natural consolidator and growth leader
in the sector. We added nearly 5,000 seats in premium markets over the past year. Our growth has been

-----

thoughtful and has been driven by targeted development (through acquisitions, greenfields and expansions),
based on data and insights, which has complemented embedded growth stemming from our ability to drive
enrollments and fill available capacity at our existing schools. Our track-record of acquisitions, greenfield
projects and expansions has demonstrated our ability to create and fill new additional capacity. For example,
enrollments grew at the Stamford American International School in Singapore (our first greenfield development)
from approximately 109 students in fiscal year 2010 to approximately 2,900 students in fiscal year 2017.
Likewise, following our acquisition of the British School of Barcelona, enrollments grew by 84% during the
same period. Successfully implemented transactions such as these, where we preserve and enhance the quality of
the acquired school in addition to growing enrollment, have further demonstrated our ability to transact in many
markets and have made us a buyer-of-choice for family and trusts.

Our data driven approach has resulted in us developing a proprietary pipeline of opportunities curated over more
than 10 years. We intend to continue to evaluate both strategic expansion, acquisition and greenfield
opportunities to develop capacity in markets in which we have experience or which we have identified as
attractive based on rigorous analysis of the relevant market dynamics. We have identified a number of additional
capacity expansion opportunities in certain regions. For example, we are in the process of developing the ELIS
school in Murcia, Spain and we are embarking on the second phase of expansion at the Stamford American
school in Hong Kong. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to enter new regions such as the Middle
East and expanding into new markets in Asia and Latin America.

**The Transactions**

_The Acquisition_

On September 3, 2018, Lernen Bidco Limited (“Bidco”) entered into a share purchase agreement (the
“Acquisition Agreement”) to purchase from the Sellers 100% of the share capital of Cognita Topco Limited, a
company incorporated under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey (the “Target”) and the indirect owner of 100% of
the share capital of the Company. As part of the Acquisition, certain management sellers elected to subscribe for
an indirect stake representing 25% of the voting rights attached to the Target’s shares in substitution for the cash
consideration attributable to the value of their shares in the Target (the “Management Investors”). See “Principal
_Shareholders.”_

_The Financing_

In connection with the Acquisition, (i) Bidco entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement, which provides for
(a) a facility with a GBP tranche in an aggregate principal amount equal to £200 million and an euro tranche in
an aggregate principal amount equal to €255,275,696 (together, the “B1 Facility”) and (b) a facility in an
aggregate principal amount equal to €52,551,816 made available for and conditional on the signing of the
Specified Acquisitions (as further described below) (the “B2 Facility” and, together with the B1 Facility, the
“Term Loan B Facilities”) and (ii) the Issuer entered into a Bridge Facility Agreement, which provides for an
aggregate principal amount equal to €255,275,696 (the “Bridge Facility”), the proceeds of which were lent to
Bidco under an intercompany loan (the “Intercompany Loan”). The Senior Facilities Agreement also provides for
a Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to £100,000,000. For a more detailed
description of the Senior Facilities and the Intercompany Loan, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercompany Loan.”_
Bidco used the proceeds of the Bridge Facility, the Term Loan B Facilities (including €2,618,278 drawn under
the B2 Facility, which was made available to complete the acquisition of the Santo Tomas school in Chile (the
“Santo Tomas Acquisition”)) and the Shareholder Contribution to finance the Acquisition, complete the Santo
Tomas Acquisition and to repay certain of the Group’s existing debt (such transactions, collectively referred to as
the “Financing”). The Acquisition and the Financing were completed on October 25, 2018 (the “Acquisition
Completion Date”).

**Recent Developments**

**The B2 Facility**

The Term Loan B Facilities include a committed €52,551,816 facility (the “B2 Facility”), which is available for
the direct or indirect financing or refinancing of certain Specified Acquisitions (as described below) that have
signed on or before March 31, 2019 in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Senior Facilities
Agreement. Commitments representing amounts not drawn under the B2 Facility by March 31, 2019 are
automatically cancelled. Amounts drawn under the B2 Facility in connection with Specified Acquisitions that

Offering Memorandum, €48,188,019 is outstanding under the B2 Facility and available for four additional
acquisition opportunities (see “—Acquisition Opportunities in Exclusivity”). See “Risk Factors—If we are unable
_to identify, complete and successfully integrate acquisitions, our ability to grow our business may be limited and_

_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Results of_
_Operations and Financial Condition—Acquisitions, Capacity Expansion, Greenfield Developments and_

**The Specified Acquisitions**

The Specified Acquisitions include acquisitions that have already completed as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum and the acquisition opportunities in exclusivity described below.

_The Santo Tomas Acquisition_

On August 31, 2018 we acquired the Santo Tomas school in Santiago, Chile. We drew €2,618,278 under the B2
Facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to fund a portion of the acquisition price.

_The CEM Acquisition_

On November 6, 2018, we acquired 90% of the share capital of Colegio Europeo de Madrid (“CEM”) in Madrid,
Spain, with an option to purchase the remaining 10% (the “CEM Acquisition”). We drew €1,745,519 under the
B2 Facility on November 12, 2018 to fund a portion of the acquisition price.

_Acquisition Opportunities in Exclusivity_

As part of our ongoing corporate strategy of continuing to look for expansion and acquisition opportunities in
existing and selected attractive and scalable markets (see “—Our Strategy—Continue to look for expansion and
_acquisition opportunities in existing and selected attractive and scalable markets”), we selectively consider_
strategic opportunities from time to time.

We have entered into non-binding memoranda of understanding with respect to four acquisition opportunities
and are in exclusivity. The first of these acquisition opportunities is in Chile and has Average Student Capacity
of 1,481, Average FTE Students of 1,304 and Average FTE Staff of 91 for the twelve months ended August 31,
2018. The second opportunity is also for a school in Chile that has Average Student Capacity of 1,980, Average
FTE Students of 1,717, Average FTE Staff of 181 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018. The third
opportunity is in Spain and has Average Student Capacity of 1,080, Average FTE Students of 853 and Average
FTE Staff of 120 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018. Finally, the fourth acquisition opportunity is for
a complimentary business in the UK offering extra-curricular language programs to students around the world,
which delivered approximately 15,000 student weeks of language programs globally during the twelve months
ended August 31, 2018.

Each of the specified acquisition opportunities is independent and the signing and closing of any one of the
specified acquisition opportunities is not conditional on the signing and closing of any of the others. There can be
no assurances that all or any of such acquisitions will take place. We expect that a combination of cash on
balance sheet, cash from operations and the B2 Facility, as well as new equity from our shareholders to the extent
necessary, will be sufficient to finance the purchase price of these acquisition opportunities. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to our Indebtedness—Commitments representing amounts not drawn under the B2 Facility by_
_March 31, 2019 will be automatically cancelled.”_

**Trading Update**

Total average student enrollment for the two months ended October 31, 2018 was 42,240 compared to 36,197 for
the two months ended October 31, 2017, an increase of 6,043 (or 17%). This includes total average student
enrollments of 10,437 in Asia compared to 9,081 for the two months ended October 31, 2017, an increase of
1,356 (or 15%), 14,446 in Europe compared to 14,296 for the two months ended October 31, 2017, an increase of
150 (or 1%) and 17,357 in Latin America compared to 12,820 for the two months ended October 31, 2017, an
increase of 4,537 (or 35%). This resulted in a utilization of 76% for the period, unchanged as compared to the
two months ended October 31, 2017.

Revenues for the two months ended October 31, 2018 were £78.6 million compared with £70.2 million for the
same period of the previous fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to £15.5 million for the two months ended
October 31, 2018, an increase of £0.9 million compared to the same period of the previous financial year. These
results are in line with management’s expectations and are based on our draft management accounts. These
results do not give effect to adoption of IFRS 15 or IFRS 16. For a description of the expected impact of the
adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies—Accounting standards issued but not yet effective.”_

The financial results for the two month period ended October 31, 2018 are derived from preliminary management
accounts and have not been audited, reviewed or verified by our independent auditors. During the course of our


11


-----

upcoming financial statement closing and review process for the three months ended November 30, 2018, we
could identify items that would require adjustments to be made and which could affect the results of operations
for the periods presented. Those procedures for such period have not been commenced and the operating results
for such period may be different than the performance and trends indicated by the financial results for the two
month period ended October 31, 2018 and such changes may be material. The information for the two months
ended October 31, 2018 should not be regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other
person regarding our financial performance for the three months ended November 30, 2018.

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OPERATING INFORMATION**

The Issuer was incorporated on August 28, 2018 for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer has
no material assets or liabilities (other than its shares in Lernen Bidco Limited and receivables under the
Intercompany Loan) and has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its incorporation and
participation in the Transactions. Consequently, we have not included any historical financial information
relating to the Issuer in this Offering Memorandum, other than certain limited financial data presented on a
consolidated basis “as adjusted” to reflect the Transactions. The consolidated capitalization of the Issuer is not
directly comparable to the consolidated capitalization of the Company. See “Capitalization.” See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—The Issuer is a holding company with_
_no independent operations and is dependent on payments from its operating subsidiaries in order to provide it_
_with funds to meet its obligations.”_

The Target was incorporated under the laws of Jersey on February 4, 2013 and is the indirect parent of the
Company and the holding Company for the Group. We have not included any historical financial data for the
Target in this Offering Memorandum.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on July 3, 2015 for the purposes of
facilitating the 2015 Refinancing Transactions. We have included in this Offering Memorandum and discuss
herein, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and
for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and, in each case, the related notes thereto. Unless the
context otherwise requires, the use of the term “Group,” “our,” “us” and “we” in this Offering Memorandum
refers to the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and
for the years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our
consolidated financial information is presented in Pound sterling.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries has been derived from or developed by applying adjustments to our historical results as
of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the
use of proceeds therefrom, as if it had occurred on August 31, 2018 with respect to balance sheet data and
September 1, 2017 with respect to data derived from our profit and loss account. The unaudited adjustments are
based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances
and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is
presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited as adjusted financial information does not purport to
represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Transactions, including
the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, actually occurred at the beginning of the period or on the date
indicated, and such information does not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition for any
future period or as of any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in
conjunction with the information contained in “Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial_
statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The unaudited as
adjusted financial information is not intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC
requirements or IFRS. We have included reconciliations of certain of the non-IFRS measures included in this
Offering Memorandum back to the relevant IFRS figures in “Appendix A—Certain Reconciliations.”

We present certain figures below on an organic basis in order to eliminate the impact of changes in our scope of
consolidation with divestments, acquisitions and new school openings excluded from the relevant period. We use
figures prepared on an organic basis, as we believe that they provide a means by which to analyze and explain
variations from one period to another on a more comparable basis than historical figures, since they eliminate the
effects of changes in our scope of consolidation, which do not directly impact our organic performance.
However, these figures provided on an organic basis are not measurements of performance under IFRS. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”

Notes:

(1) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other ratios derived therefrom are
non-IFRS measures. We define EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation, amortization of other intangibles and impairment. We
define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before Non-underlying costs. We define Group Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA
including 100% of joint venture (St Nicholas Preparatory School) Adjusted EBITDA. We define Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as
Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for the full-year effect of completed acquisitions, the incremental EBITDA from confirmed
September 2018 enrollment, the expected in-year net growth in Average FTE Students and the expected pro forma EBITDA
contributions of acquisitions currently in exclusivity. Investors should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted
EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an alternative to profit/(loss) before taxation as a measure of our operating performance,
(b) as an alternative to net cash outflows or inflows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet
cash needs or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. Because companies do not calculate EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA identically, our presentation of such measures may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors should also note that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Group
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented above are calculated differently from “Consolidated EBITDA” as
defined and used in the Indenture and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in our Financial Statements. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Definitions” for a definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Indenture. See our Financial Statements for a presentation of_
Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of profit/(loss) for the year to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and to Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA:

Notes:

(a) Impairment costs for (i) fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 relate to the write down of UK assets that were sold and leased back in
the period and the impairment of eight schools within the UK and two schools in Latin America and a reversal of impairment was
recognize relating to two schools in the UK, (ii) fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 relate to the impairment of two schools within
the UK and (iii) fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 relate to the impairment of assets in two UK schools and one school in Latin
America.

(b) Restructuring costs during the periods under review mainly relate to employment cessation, management restructuring and
associated legal costs (£4.7 million, £2.5 million, £2.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively), school closing costs
(£2.2 million, £3.6 million, in 2016 and 2017, respectively associated with Chilton Cantelo, Cranbrook, Sackville and Avondale
schools and a credit of £1.2 million in 2018 driven by the £1.9 million release of the Avondale provision originally made in 2017)
and £1.4 million charge associated with the acquisition accounting of the remaining 50% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture in 2017.

(c) Acquisition and business exploration costs include expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or expansion
opportunities (including legal and due diligence fees) as well as marketing and other expenses incurred prior to the opening of new
schools.

(d) Other non-recurring items includes non-cash charges relating to the management incentive plan (£3.95 million, £0.25 million and
£14.79 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively) and gains/(losses) on disposals of fixed
assets (£0.04 million, £0.28 million and £(0.37) million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively). In
2018, it also included £8.3 million of the costs associated with the Acquisition.

(e) Represents the portion of EBITDA derived from the St Nicholas Joint Venture to reflect 100% ownership of the joint venture.

(f) Gives effect to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of (i) three acquisitions which were completed during the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2018 (Woodland, ABS and Santo Tomas) and (ii) the acquisition of CEM, which completed in November 2018 after the
fiscal year end, as if each of them was completed on September 1, 2017. The adjustment is based on the historical EBITDA of the


24


-----

entities acquired derived from management accounts for the twelve-month period ended as close to August 31, 2018 as available
and adjusted in a manner consistent with the adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to the
extent applicable.

(g) Gives effect to the estimated incremental EBITDA from confirmed September 2018 enrollment (and confirmed enrollment for
ALG, Camp Asia and the Woodland Pre-Schools for fiscal year 2019). In estimating the incremental EBITDA, we have (i) applied
constant fiscal year 2019 prices and 2018 margin to the confirmed September 2018 enrollment student numbers, (ii) given effect to
certain expected operational efficiencies as a result of the higher utilization the confirmed September 2018 enrollment may bring
and (iii) forecasted a certain growth in central costs independent from the confirmed September 2018 enrollment.

(h) Gives effect to the estimated in-year net growth in Average FTE Students from October 1, 2018 (including estimated net growth in
Average FTE Students as a result of enrollments at our schools in Latin America and our Australian curriculum schools where the
academic year commences in January). The adjustment is based on historical rates of in-year net growth in Average FTE Students
per school plus any management adjustments to reflect relevant market conditions, competition and other factors for such school. In
arriving at the estimated incremental EBITDA from estimated in-year net growth in Average FTE Students, we have (i) applied
constant fiscal year 2019 prices and 2018 margin to the estimated in-year net growth numbers, (ii) given effect to certain expected
operational efficiencies as a result of the higher utilization the estimated in-year net growth may bring and (iii) forecasted a certain
growth in central costs independent from the estimated in-year net growth.

(i) Gives effect to the Adjusted EBITDA of four of the Specified Acquisitions as if each of them was completed on September 1, 2017.
The four acquisition opportunities are subject to non-binding memoranda of understanding and are in exclusivity: (i) the first is in
Chile and has Average Student Capacity of 1,481, Average FTE Students of 1,304, Average FTE Staff of 91 for the twelve months
ended August 31, 2018, (ii) the second is also in Chile and has Average Student Capacity of 1,980, Average FTE Students of 1,717,
Average FTE Staff of 181 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, (iii) the third is in Spain and has Average Student
Capacity of 1,080, Average FTE Students of 853, Average FTE Staff of 120 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 and
(iv) the fourth is in the UK and relates to a complimentary business offering extra-curricular language program to students around
the world, which administered approximately 15,000 student weeks of language programs globally during the twelve months
August 31, 2018. Each of the specified acquisition opportunities is independent and the signing and closing of any one of the
specified acquisition opportunities is not conditional on the signing and closing of any of the others. None of the acquisition
opportunities on a stand-alone basis represents more than 30% of the total adjustment. The adjustment is based on the historical
EBITDA of the entities acquired for the twelve month-period ended August 31, 2018 and adjusted in a manner consistent with the
adjustments applied to our Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to the extent applicable. We expect to finance the
Specified Acquisitions (in part) with drawings from the B2 Facility.

(j) The pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA presented above are for informational purposes only and do not purport to present
what either the newly acquired or existing schools’ results of operations and financial condition would have been, nor do they
purport to project such schools’ results of operations for any future period or financial condition at any future date. The assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA presented above are based on our current estimates, and they involve
risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such pro forma financial
information. Some of the factors that could result in the newly acquired or existing schools’ results of operations not achieving the
anticipated Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA include the failure to adequately integrate new acquisitions into our network or slower
integration than expected, adverse macroeconomic conditions in the regions where the new schools are located, increased
competition from local or other international school operators and the failure to retain existing students at the school and/or increase
enrollments to meet unfilled capacity. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— We may not realize any or all of our
_anticipated pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA included in this Offering Memorandum.”_

(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage and Group Adjusted EBITDA
margin is defined as Group Adjusted EBITDA divided by Group revenue, expressed as a percentage.

(3) Includes 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2017.

(4) We track the amount of capitalized operating capital expenditure and development capital expenditure in our management information
from a balance sheet perspective. We have used this information to present operating capital expenditure and development capital
expenditure in this Offering Memorandum. Our cash flow information only reflects our aggregate capital expenditure. As we do not track
the split of cash flows attributable to operating capital expenditure and development capital expenditure, we have used the amount of
operating capital expenditure based on management information from a balance sheet perspective for the purposes of calculating
Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow.

(5) Development capital expenditure represents investments made to expand capacity at our schools and/or for the construction and
development of other large investments in facilities which do not directly result in capacity expansion.

(6) Operating capital expenditure represents investments made to maintain our equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with applicable
regulations and to improve our teaching and learning infrastructure. This includes the ongoing replacement and upgrading of fixtures and
fittings and IT equipment, including computers and laptops.

(7) We define Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less operating capital expenditure less net change in working
capital and other operating cash flow items less Non-underlying costs (for a description of Non-underlying costs, please see items (a),
(b), (c) and (d) under footnote (1) above). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows—Net Cash Inflow from Operating Activities.” Operating cash conversion_
rate is defined as the ratio of Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow to Adjusted EBITDA. The table below shows the calculations of
Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow and operating cash conversion rate. Before operating capital expenditures and non-underlying costs,

operating cash conversion was 104.8%, 104.4% and 115.2% for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. For
a reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow to operating cash flow, see “Appendix A – Reconciliations.”

(8) The unaudited as adjusted financial information presented herein has been derived from or developed by applying adjustments to our
historical results as of and for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, to give effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom,
as if it had occurred on August 31, 2018 with respect to balance sheet data and September 1, 2017 with respect to data derived from our
profit and loss account. The unaudited adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is presented for informational purposes only. The
unaudited as adjusted financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have
been had the Refinancing Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom actually occurred at the beginning of
the period or on the date indicated, and such information does not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition for
any future period or as of any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in “Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Offering_
Memorandum. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is not intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements or IFRS.

(9) As adjusted cash at bank and in hand represents total cash at bank and in hand of the Issuer and its subsidiaries of £65.4 million as of
August 31, 2018, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if they had
occurred on August 31, 2018. See also “Capitalization.”

(10) As adjusted net total debt as of August 31, 2018, represents total debt of the Issuer, assuming the B2 Facility is fully drawn, and its
subsidiaries less as adjusted cash at bank and in hand, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of
proceeds therefrom and drawdowns and scheduled repayments of the Local Facilities prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, as if they
had occurred on August 31, 2018. In addition, as of August 31, 2018, we also had £1.8 million available under our Local Facilities and
£100 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, including overdraft facilities and working capital facilities,
which have not been included in adjusted total debt since they are undrawn commitments. See “Summary—The B2 Facility.”

(11) As adjusted net secured debt represents as adjusted net total debt less the Notes as of August 31, 2018.

(12) As adjusted interest expense represents interest payable for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if it had occurred on September 1, 2017, assuming the B2
Facility is fully drawn and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn for such period. Any hedging we may undertake in
respect of our obligations has not been reflected.

**RISK FACTORS**

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information contained
within this Offering Memorandum prior to making an investment decision. If any of the events described below
were to occur, or if other risks or uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we believe to be immaterial were
to occur, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely
affected. In such a case, the Issuer might not be able to satisfy its obligations under the Notes, and you could lose
all or a part of your investment. Prospective investors should note that the risks described below are not the only
risks we face. We have described only those risks relating to our operations of which we are aware and that we
believe to be material. There may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we
are unaware.

**Risks Relating to our Business**

**_Our financial performance depends on the level of student enrollment in our schools._**

The level of student enrollments and utilization rates in our schools are critical to our future financial
performance. A number of factors may contribute to a decline in student enrollment rates at our schools,
including competition from other providers, poor macroeconomic conditions in local markets, political instability
in the jurisdictions in which we operate, expatriate relocation, graduation, decline in student performance or
parent satisfaction, maintaining curricula that are attractive to students and parents or other disruptive events
which could cause the temporary or permanent closure of any of our schools. We may be unable to maintain and/
or increase enrollment rates in our schools if we are unable to secure new students through our recruitment
efforts. In addition, if we fail to maintain the quality of our educational offerings, parents may choose not to
re-enroll or may remove their children from our schools. If we are unable to recruit or retain students in our
schools, our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected.

**_If we are unable to enroll sufficient students in our new facilities, our business, financial condition and results_**
**_of operations may be adversely affected._**

We opened new facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong during 2017 and in London, Spain and Brazil during
2018. The opening of the Stamford American School in Hong Kong, represented an expansion into a new
country, where we may find challenges related to cultural differences and relationships with local education
authorities and other regulatory bodies. A second phase of the development is underway and as a result, the
school is only partially open. The school has had a strong opening with approximately 600 pupils currently
enrolled, however its success is dependent on continued evolved growth in future years.

Our development project in Singapore and the opening of the Early Learning Village increased our footprint in
the country, but also exposes us to macroeconomic risks should the Singapore economy and/or the number of
expatriate visitors decline. A decline in the Singapore economy could also have a negative adverse impact on the
existing business as well as the new development.

Our expansion project in London added a further site in the Southbank International School and in Spain a new
pre-university campus has been added to the British School of Barcelona.

Where we have ongoing construction projects funded from Group resources, as is the case in Hong Kong, there
could be currency exposure where the funds available to draw are different from the future liabilities of
constructing the asset. This could also create a currency exposure, as future cash flows generated will be in a
different currency to the debt drawn.

**_Our financial performance depends in part on our ability to increase the profitability of our schools._**

The tuition fee levels at some of our schools are among the highest in their respective markets. The factors that
could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our tuition fees include:

- negative perceptions of the quality of our educational offerings;

- resistance to tuition increases by tuition payers for reasons such as difficult economic conditions or previous
fee increases in recent academic years;

- the requirement for regulatory approval to increase tuition fees in some of the markets in which we operate;

- reductions or discounts of tuition by local education providers that seek to compete in our markets;

- competition from local education providers that may offer lower tuition fees or that may not increase tuition
fees in line with us; and

30


-----

- adverse reactions from parents at one or more of our schools, which may result in demands from parents for
increased services or subject us to parent scrutiny over staff pay awards.

In addition, market or regulatory factors may limit our ability to maintain or control staff costs, which could have
an adverse effect on our operational costs and profitability. For example, we may be required to offer additional
compensation or benefits to our staff to satisfy independent unions or other collective bargaining bodies or
agencies or to maintain competitive compensation packages in a particular market.

Our inability to maintain or increase our tuition fees or to maintain or control our staff costs could have a
material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_We may be adversely impacted by the British exit from the EU._**

As a UK based organisation with global operations, our business may be impacted by the implications of the
UK’s separation from the EU.

Although the timing and nature of the UK’s separation from the EU remains unclear, there are currently no
significant adverse implications to business operations and results to report. However, there are some potential
risks that could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial
condition:

- The Group has entered into and may in the future enter into forward exchange contracts in respect of the
Notes and the Senior Facilities, however fluctuations in exchange rates will impact Group results which are
reported in Pound sterling.

- London’s status as a financial centre could be compromised, which in turn could impact the demand for
international schools.

- We may find it harder to attract and retain students and teachers from the EU if visa entry requirements
become more stringent or if our UK Visas and Immigrations Tier 2 and/or Tier 4 licences are revoked or
cease to be renewed.

- The use of British qualifications for Spanish university entry and number of Spanish students applying to
British universities may be impacted.

- A significant adverse impact to the UK or European economy could lead to a decline in demand for
independent school places in the UK and Spain which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Any of these effects of Brexit, and others that we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_We may be adversely impacted by the macroeconomic environment._**

Our operations are affected by the general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we operate.
These macroeconomic conditions are monitored on an ongoing basis along with the impact on our current and
future financial performance. Risks identified during the year included the ongoing potential implications arising
from the British referendum on the EU, softening in the growth outlook for the Asia region driven by global
macroeconomic environment changes compared to mid-2015, the independence debate within the Catalonia
region of Spain and general economic pressure and potential political and regulatory changes in the Latin
America region.

Additionally, changes in the compensation and benefits packages of those expatriates whose employers pay for
their children’s tuition fees may negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our tuition fees. A change
from direct payment from the employer to a cost of living adjustment in the form of a lump sum payment in cash
to expatriate parents may cause such parents to become more price sensitive in respect of the tuition they are
willing to pay.

Even though to date these factors have had a limited impact on our financial performance due to the importance
of education for parents and the general stability of the markets in which we operate, as well as our focus on
controlling our costs, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations,
cash flow and financial condition in the future and as a result, we will continue to monitor developments and the
potential related risks.

**_If we are not able to attract, employ, train and retain sufficiently qualified teachers, principals, school_**
**_administrators and support staff, it may impact the quality of teaching at our schools, compromising academic_**
**_performance and overall reputation, and our ability to selectively expand our operations._**

Well trained and sufficiently qualified teachers are critical to maintaining the quality of teaching provided at our
schools. Our ability to deliver high quality education across a range of curricula is directly related to, and

31


-----

dependent on, the availability of qualified teachers and our ability to continue to recruit, employ, train and retain
such teachers. In addition, our ability to retain and, where necessary, attract teachers, principals, school
administrators and support staff is important for our operations in providing premium education. The process of
hiring staff with the combination of skills and attributes required to implement our business strategy can be
difficult and time-consuming. We face competition in attracting and retaining staff who possess the necessary
experience and accreditation to teach at our schools. Predicted growth in the number of international schools
across the world is likely to increase competition for qualified and experienced staff in the coming years making
it even more important for us to be competitive and promote a great place to work. We may experience particular
difficulty in recruiting staff who are willing to relocate from their home country to some of our international
locations and we must provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain qualified individuals to
join our schools. In addition, some of our teachers could choose to remain at the school only for a limited period
of time, which could affect our reputation in the market if we provide insufficient continuity. As we continue to
expand and add personnel, we may face additional difficulty in maintaining consistency in the quality of the
teaching staff that we recruit. A shortage of quality teaching personnel and a high turnover rate of staff could lead
to ineffective delivery of the curricula offered to students, impacting their academic performance and the
reputation and brand of our schools. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain
qualified and effective teachers, principals, school administrators and support staff at our schools, our business,
prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

**_We may face significant competition in each geographic market in which we operate, which could reduce_**
**_enrollments, increase our cost of recruiting and retaining students and teachers and put downward pressure_**
**_on our tuition fees and profitability._**

We face competition from numerous sources, including from other schools in the locations in which we operate
that target the children of expatriate and/or affluent local families. Some of our existing and potential competitors
may choose to devote more resources to the development of schools offering premium quality education and
respond more quickly to changes in parents’ and students’ demands, curriculum offerings, admissions standards,
market needs or new technologies. Moreover, our competitors may increase capacity to an extent which may lead
to an over-supply in certain of our markets.

If we are unable to differentiate our schools from those of our competitors and successfully market our schools to
parents and students, we could face competitive pressures that may result in a decrease in enrollments or an
increase in students switching to other schools. To the extent our school enrollment may decrease, we may be
required to reduce our tuition rates or increase spending in order to improve facilities in an effort to retain or to
attract students. This could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash
flow and financial condition.

**_Our operations in some countries may be affected by changes in the political, economic, social or regulatory_**
**_and legal environment._**

We conduct our business operations in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong,
Brazil, and Chile. As a result, our success depends in part upon our ability to adapt to and succeed in differing
economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions. In particular, financial risks associated with our
operations include risks of liquidity, inflation, devaluation, price volatility, currency convertibility and exchange
rates and actual or perceived risk of country default resulting from significant deficits.

In the twelve months ended August 31, 2018, we generated 31.2% of our Adjusted EBITDA from our operations
in Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil and Chile. Such emerging economies are more susceptible to global economic
trends and higher inflationary pressure, which could result in decrease in demand or a heightened sensitivity to
moderate pricing increases in tuition fees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results
of operations and financial condition. Some of these countries lack highly developed legal systems and are
susceptible to high levels of corruption. Our operations in emerging economies increase our exposure to anticorruption laws, or similar laws.

Furthermore, our operations in such economies are governed by local laws and regulations, including those
applicable to foreign investments and to foreign-owned enterprises. Such laws and regulations may be vague,
uncertain and difficult to interpret. Furthermore, implementation and enforcement of regulation is not always
consistent or predictable. For example, the rise of a populist government or new tax laws or regulations could
have a negative impact upon our business. We may experience difficulties or delays in obtaining permits or other
governmental authorizations required to operate our schools and restrictions as to the eligibility criteria of
students. Exposure to regulatory uncertainty could limit our legal protection and ability to comply with
regulations applicable to us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of
operations, cash flow and financial condition.

32


-----

In the United Kingdom, the Government-backed Teacher Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”) of which the majority
of our UK teaching staff are members, announced in October 2018 a proposal to increase employer pension
contributions to the Scheme from 16.4% to 23.6% of members gross salary. The proposal is currently in
consultation and would take effect from September 2019. If implemented in full, this could lead to an increase in
costs in the United Kingdom of approximately £2-£3 million per annum.

In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we generated 7% of our Adjusted EBITDA from our school in the
Catalonia region in Spain. The regional government of Catalonia held a non-binding referendum in October 2017
that backed independence by a large margin of those taking part in the vote. The Spanish government declared
the referendum illegal and maintains that Catalonia has no constitutional right to break away, and imposed direct
rule on the region after the regional government in Barcelona declared independence. Exposure to political
uncertainty could lead to changes in laws, regulations and the macro-economic environment in Catalonia. This
could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial
conditions in the region.

Unstable political conditions, civil unrest, student uprisings or other developments in the countries where we
operate could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and
financial condition. For example, a natural disaster in any country in which we operate could adversely impact
the performance of one or more of our schools in that region.

**_Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for our teachers and staff and other employee relation_**
**_issues may adversely affect our financial results._**

All of our teachers currently employed in Brazil, and certain of our teachers in Chile, Spain and Vietnam are
subject to collective bargaining agreements. We are required to consult and seek the advice of unions with
respect to a broad range of matters, which could prevent or delay new initiatives. At present, we have three
organized unions in Chile (Penalolen, ABS and Santo Tomas) and collective bargaining agreements in place for
all three unions. In Brazil, all employees are unionized by law. The collective bargaining agreements are
negotiated at a state or municipal level and they directly effect our employees’ contracts. For example, we are
required to consult unions in order to get approval for agreements varying individual employees’ working hours
and for requesting teachers to work on a winter or summer camp. If relationships with our teachers and other
staff or the unions that represent them become adverse, we could experience labor disruptions, such as strikes.
Labor disruptions, which are generally more likely to occur when collective bargaining agreements are being
renegotiated, could harm our relationship with our teachers and other staff or cause strained relationships with
parents and students and could result in temporary disruptions to our ability to operate schools where such labor
disruptions occur. For example, in Chile we have had strikes or threats of strikes in relation to the Penalolen
union. Additionally, in Brazil, there was a one-day teacher strike in 2018, which came amid a wave of strikes in
other industries in the country. Future labor disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Additionally, labor regulation or the settlement of labor disputes could lead to higher wage and benefit costs and
increased operating expenses and legal costs. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective
bargaining agreements when they expire. For example, the collective bargaining agreements for the three Chilean
unions will expire in 2021, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We may also be subject to or affected by labor
disruptions unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Due to our operation of several schools
within one group, we are also exposed to the risk that a labor dispute or settlement of such at any one school may
result in similar disputes or a requirement for similar settlements at other schools within our Group. Any such
labor disruptions or potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow,
financial condition and results of operations. Although management believes that its relationship with teachers
and other staff is generally good, there can be no assurance that there will not be labor disputes and/or adverse
employee relations in the future.

**_We may face restrictions on our ability to transfer and distribute funds, including as a result of exchange_**
**_controls in certain countries._**

We currently transfer and distribute funds between the jurisdictions in which we operate and we expect to
continue to do so in order to fund our cash and financing requirements. To transfer funds between jurisdictions,
we rely principally on intercompany loans, cash pooling arrangements, dividends and the payment of
management fees. If any of the transfers or arrangements described above were found to be invalid or not in
compliance with relevant laws and regulations, we may not be able to make distributions from these schools.

We may also be subject to exchange control risks, which include (i) availability risk, the risk that Pound sterling,
euro or U.S. dollar will not be available for conversion in a particular country; (ii) convertibility risk, the risk that
a local government will restrict, condition or terminate our legal right to convert the local currency into Pound

33


-----

sterling, euro or U.S. dollar; and (iii) transferability risk, the risk that a local government will allow us to convert
the local currency into Pound sterling, euro or U.S. dollar, but will place restrictions or prohibitions on those
Pound sterling, euro or U.S. dollar leaving the country. For example, our schools hold significant non-Pound
sterling cash balances in overseas operations which arise from tuition fee income and which represent a
combination of working capital and trading profits. These balances are held in operations which include countries
where exchange control restrictions, withholding taxes and other restrictions may prevent full repatriation of
funds to the United Kingdom. The imposition of exchange controls and restrictions on foreign currency
remittance could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial
condition. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk.”_

**_If our schools fail to comply with the policies, laws and regulations for school operations, we could incur_**
**_financial penalties, face restrictions on our operations, and/or lose our authorizations to operate our schools._**

Our business is subject to the policies, laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate. These
policies and regulations apply to many aspects of our business, including:

- applying for, obtaining and maintaining necessary authorizations to operate as an education provider from
the relevant government department for education in each jurisdiction in which we operate;

- monitoring of school standards by a third party, e.g. the Independent Schools Inspectorate in the UK;

- applying for, obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses, permits, visas, accreditations, certifications and
other authorizations for operating our schools and employing our teachers;

- our ability to recruit students;

- limits on acceptance of Singaporean national students after age five and Vietnamese national students in
primary school and high school. See “—We are subject to rules arising from our ownership structures in
_Thailand and Vietnam”;_

- employment conditions, including taxation rates, minimum or mandatory terms and conditions of
employment of staff and other factors related to teaching staff;

- the development of curricula that meet the requirements of local educational authorities;

- ownership structure, in particular policies and regulations that relate to foreign ownership; and

- the construction and maintenance of our buildings and other facilities in compliance with applicable
building codes, permits, zoning and other rules, regulations and ordinances affecting occupancy and use of
our facilities.

We may not be able to comply with such policies, laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we
operate or in which we would like to expand our operations, or we may incur significant costs to do so. Our
failure to comply with applicable policies, laws and regulations could result in financial penalties, restrictions on
our operations, loss or limitation of our authorizations to operate schools, loss of or restrictions on our ability to
use certain facilities, unfavorable ratings from the relevant regulatory authority, the imposition of significant
compliance costs or suspension orders which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,
results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_We may lose or fail to maintain accreditations, permission or certifications that we currently use to operate_**
**_our schools._**

In order to operate our schools, we have received and maintain various accreditations from curriculum providers
and permissions from examination bodies. To maintain these accreditations and permissions, we must meet
standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality,
staff, administrative capability, resources, including facility standards, and financial stability. Any failure to
satisfy such standards or maintain or renew the relevant accreditations, could result in the loss of such
accreditations or permissions, which could result in the suspension or loss of our ability to administer certain
curricular as well as the ability to award the relevant educational qualification or diplomas to our students at a
particular school. If we are unable to award the relevant educational qualification to our students, we may be
subject to litigation from parents and/or the relevant regulatory authority or other risks, including closure of a
school, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and
financial condition.

**_We may be liable for certain acts that affect the health and safety of the students and staff in our schools or_**
**_which breach our duty of care towards our students, which may harm our reputation and adversely affect our_**
**_business and financial results._**

As a provider of education for children, the activities in which we engage, both on school premises and during
school trips and activities outside of school, may inherently pose risks related to the health and safety of our
students and staff. In compliance with our established guidelines and policies, we rely on our teachers and staff to
provide adequate care and supervision for our students, and any failure to do so may result in complaints, claims
or investigations against us, our schools and our teachers and staff. In the event of personal injuries, accidents or
other events that adversely affect the well-being of our students, we do, from time-to-time, face claims alleging
that we were negligent, provided inadequate supervision, failed to respond appropriately to protect our students
or were otherwise responsible for causing injury or other harm. In addition, we may be responsible for the care of
students in circumstances that are out of our control, including during hurricanes, cyclones, floods or other
natural disasters. We may also face allegations that teachers, other personnel, or students behaved or were
perceived to have behaved inappropriately or illegally, committed unlawful acts or that we failed to conduct
proper background checks on our staff who came into contact with children or that such vetting procedures were
not adequate in determining potential risks with respect to our staff, contracted staff or service providers.

The occurrence, actual or alleged, of unlawful acts or events described above and others that may impact our
students or staff could expose us to financial liability and, potentially, administrative penalties. This would be
especially true if the potential liability exceeded our insurance coverage. Even if we are not at fault, such a claim
could also divert management attention from our operations, cause us to incur substantial costs in defending
against the claim and have an adverse effect on our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Further developments relating to the widely reported inappropriate conduct by a former teacher at the_**
**_Southbank International School could result in damage to our reputation, a decrease in enrollments, civil_**
**_liabilities and regulatory or other legal action, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition._**

A former teacher at the Southbank International School was engaged in criminal conduct with respect to a
number of students during the course of his career, including between 2009 and 2013, during which time he
taught at Southbank International School. Although Southbank International School conducted background
checks consistent with the legislative requirements at the time, and while independent inspections prior to the
discovery of such conduct had found the school to be compliant (either on initial inspection or on re-inspection
following the identification of compliance issues), we commissioned an independent review that concluded that
there were aspects of the school’s recruitment and other practices that could be improved. The findings from a
UK statutory Serious Case Review were published in January 2016 and the recommendations included therein
supported those made in the independent review. National and international police investigations, which have
been widely reported in the United Kingdom national media, were conducted with respect to the former teacher,
since deceased. These investigations have now ended. Our insurers have agreed to cover current and future
claims, subject to an agreed review process for each claim. To date only a small number of claims have been
made, though we may face further civil claims by such persons or by other affected students and their parents.
Such claims may be filed either individually or as a joint action. Although we maintain insurance coverage, and
believe such insurance will be adequate to cover the full amount of expected claims, we cannot provide any
assurance that claims will not exceed expected amounts or the level of insurance cover. While enrollment levels
at Southbank International School have not been affected, the consequences of any further reputational damage
could materially and adversely affect our enrollments, retention of students and parent satisfaction for all three
Southbank schools we operate as well as have an adverse impact on the Southbank International brand, all of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and
financial condition.

**_Any event that negatively affects the reputation of, or standards and quality associated with our schools could_**
**_adversely affect our business._**

Maintaining the reputation of, and value associated with, our schools are important factors in developing and
maintaining goodwill among our students, parents and staff. Our reputation could be adversely affected under
many circumstances, including if we do not maintain consistent quality in teaching, the curricula in our schools
are not perceived as being sufficiently high quality, allegations against our staff of inappropriate conduct, or our
school facilities do not meet the standards expected. If our value proposition deviates from our goal of delivering
an “Inspiring World of Education,” or if we lose a license, permit, accreditation or other authorization to operate
a school, receive unfavorable ratings from the relevant regulatory authority or close one or more of our schools

35


-----

due to compliance related issues, it could harm our reputation. Unfavorable publicity concerning us, our schools,
our academic approach, curriculum offerings, student and teaching staff experience, or faculty recruitment could
influence the way our schools are viewed not only by our customers, but also by other constituencies in the
education sector, the community in which our schools are located and the general public.

**_A public litigation event could negatively affect the reputation of our schools or groups which could adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

From time to time, we are party to litigation proceedings in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. In the
event of an adverse outcome, we could incur significant defense costs, be required to pay damages and interest to
the prevailing party and, depending on the jurisdiction of the litigation, be held responsible for paying the costs
of the prevailing party. See “Business—Litigation.” Even if such a claim is unsuccessful or unwarranted, it could
adversely affect our reputation, divert management attention from our operations or cause us to incur substantial
costs in connection with defending the claim. Our reputation or the reputation of one of our local schools may be
severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity.
There is a widespread use of social media platforms and similar devices, including weblogs (blogs), social media
websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of
interested persons. We believe students and prospective employers value readily available information about our
institutions and often act on such information without further investigation or authentication, and without regard
to its accuracy. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and
participants post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning
the Group and our institutions may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time and such information
may be materially adverse to our interests and reputation, which could adversely affect our business, prospects,
results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_High crime levels in certain countries and cities in which we operate may have an impact on our ability to_**
**_attract and retain students._**

Certain of our schools are located in countries or cities that have relatively high rates of violent crime. If we are
unable to maintain adequate security levels at our school campuses, and to work with local authorities to
maintain adequate security in the areas adjacent to our schools, we may not be able to continue to attract and
retain students. In addition, high crime rates may require us to make additional investments in security
infrastructure and personnel, which may cause us to increase our tuition fees in order to maintain operating
margins. For example, in the past we have increased security measures at certain of our schools in response to
local incidents. Any failure to attract and retain students because of our inability to provide a safe environment,
or any need to make substantial additional investments in security, could adversely affect enrollments and have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_If the pattern of payment of tuition fees in our schools changes, our cashflow could be adversely affected._**

We generally collect our tuition fees in advance of providing the education or services for the relevant term of
the academic year or period of service. The timing of our expenses, however, may not necessarily correspond to
this pattern. If we were required by regulation or as a result of market conditions to collect our fees after the
education has been provided, this may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and we may require additional
working capital or third-party funding to finance our operations.

We rely on the timely payment of the tuition fees charged with respect to our students. For the twelve months
ended August 31, 2018, our bad debts provisions were insignificant, representing 0.2% of Group turnover. Any
future increase in defaults or significant delays in the payment of tuition fees may impact our cash flow and our
ability to meet our obligations which may in turn have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability._**

We are exposed on a transactional and translational basis to movements in exchange rates against the Pound
sterling. The principal exposure relates to the Singapore dollar against the Pound sterling, and to a lesser extent
the euro, Vietnamese dong, Thai baht, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real and Chilean peso, respectively, against
the Pound sterling. We generally collect revenues and pay expenses in the local currency of each country in
which we operate. Our operations in the United Kingdom are conducted in Pound sterling. In Spain, our
operations are conducted in euro. In Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Thailand our operations are conducted
in the Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Vietnamese dong and Thai baht, respectively. In Brazil and Chile, our
operations are conducted in the Brazilian real and Chilean peso, respectively. Conducting business across

36


-----

multiple currencies subjects us to currency fluctuation risks. In particular, fluctuations in currency exchange rates
can have an impact on the translation of foreign currency-denominated amounts into Pound sterling, which is our
functional currency. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have an impact on our results of operations
when we transact between foreign currencies. Moreover, as the Notes are denominated in euro, if the Pound
sterling, Singapore dollar, Vietnamese dong, Thai baht, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real and Chilean peso
depreciate relative to the euro, our costs to service the Notes may increase. Any exchange rate fluctuations may
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_If we are unable to identify, complete and successfully integrate acquisitions, our ability to grow our business_**
**_may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In_**
**_addition, management’s attention may be diverted from existing operations to the integration of acquisitions._**

Historically, our growth has been, in part, attributable to acquisitions of other schools. Since our inception in
2004, we have acquired nearly all of our 71 schools across various countries. The success of our acquisition
strategy depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, to assess the value, strengths, weaknesses,
liabilities and potential profitability of such acquisition targets, the availability of sufficient financial or
operational resources to fund such acquisitions, to negotiate acceptable purchase terms and to integrate the
operations of such businesses, once acquired. Successful integration of acquired schools will depend on our
ability to effect any required changes in operations or personnel, and may require renovation or other capital
expenditure or the funding of unforeseen liabilities, especially if we discover non-compliance in circumstances
where recourse against the seller is either not advisable or not available. The integration and operation of any
future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including unanticipated costs, expenses and liabilities,
including latent or potential liabilities that relate to the time prior to our acquisition of a school but only becomes
apparent after we have taken control of such school, difficulties in integrating the acquired schools in a timely
and cost-effective manner or maintaining standard controls, policies and procedures across all our schools, the
establishment of effective management information and financial control systems, unforeseen legal, regulatory,
contractual, labor or other issues, such as defects in existing licenses arising out of the acquisitions.

As a result of our acquisitions of other schools, we may also become subject to regulatory, licensing, litigation
and other risks that arose prior to such acquisitions. The acquisition of new schools also involves other risks
including, incorrect evaluation of the school’s financial performance, cost overruns, incurring write-offs,
impairment charges, amortization expenses or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets we
record, reluctance or resistance from parents, teachers or administrators to approve of an acquisition or to stay at
the relevant school following the acquisition and an inability to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

These risks may increase when we expand into new countries or new cities in countries where we already
operate. Managing the growth of a geographically diverse business involves significant risks and challenges. We
may find it difficult to manage financial resources, implement uniform policies and standards and maintain our
operations, management, and technology systems across our global network. New markets also pose challenges
related to cultural differences and relationships with local education authorities.

We may not be able to identify, complete and successfully integrate acquisitions in the future, and our failure to
do so may limit our ability to grow our business. In addition, management’s attention may be diverted from
existing operations to focus on such newly acquired businesses and any failure to properly integrate acquired
schools could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial
condition. If we are unable to manage our current operations, our growth strategy or the risks that we may
encounter in expanding our operations into new markets, our business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

**_If we are unable to upgrade or expand the facilities of our existing schools, they may be less attractive to_**
**_students._**

When seeking to upgrade or expand the facilities of our existing schools, we could experience certain difficulties,
including the following:

- our properties may not have the capacity to accommodate the necessary or desired changes;

- suitable new land may not be available, especially in land constrained cities, such as Singapore, Hong Kong
and London;

- our existing facilities may not be configured to provide for such renovations;

- the costs of renovations and expansions may not be economical and we may not realize the anticipated
benefits of the new facilities;

37


-----

- we may be required to seek planning permits or zoning permission that may be costly and time consuming
to obtain or which may be denied;

- we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval from the licensing bodies;

- we may not be able to obtain approval for desired changes or to agree such changes on commercially
favorable terms with our landlords;

- we may not be able to secure any amendments to the terms of the lease from our landlord that would permit
us to make the investments necessary to upgrade or expand our schools;

- we may not have or be able to obtain adequate funds on commercially favorable terms or at all to finance
such upgrades and expansions of existing schools; and

- we may not be able to upgrade or expand the facilities within our anticipated timeframe, and allocated
budgets.

Our inability or failure to upgrade or expand the facilities of our existing schools could prevent us from
successfully implementing our growth strategy and may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,
results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_We may incur unanticipated costs if we choose to grow our business by building new schools or upgrading or_**
**_expanding the facilities at our existing schools._**

There are a number of financing, construction and operating risks associated with the construction of new schools
and the expansion of facilities at our existing schools. Usually, construction must be completed within a
designated timeframe. In addition, we require schools to operate from the beginning of an academic year in order
to secure enrollments and to collect fees prior to the commencement of the school term. Therefore, such
construction projects may be required to be completed on an expedited basis or may require additional
development efforts to meet predetermined deadlines that may result in significant additional costs. An
unanticipated increase in development costs may result in lower than expected returns on the investment we have
made in a new school or an existing school. In addition, it may take a significant period of time before school
buildings or new facilities become operational and start to generate additional revenue. The time taken and the
costs involved in completing construction can be adversely affected by many factors, which may include but are
not limited to the following:

- delays or refusals or limitations in obtaining the necessary land use building, planning consent, occupancy
and other required governmental permits, licenses, approvals and authorizations;

- landlord consent to any alterations;

- shortages of, or defective, materials and/or equipment, labor shortages or disputes and disputes with
subcontractors;

- increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; and

- construction accidents or adverse environmental conditions, including land contamination, some of which
are beyond our control.

The occurrence of any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_We may need additional capital in the future to fund growth initiatives or to operate our existing business._**

Significant investment is required, either by the issuance of debt or equity, to acquire, expand capacity at our
schools and build new schools. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we
may have to limit growth initiatives, alter our plans or take other actions, which may adversely affect our
business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_If we sell or close a school, we may remain subject to certain liabilities and may continue to bear reputational_**
**_risk with respect to such schools._**

Since our inception in 2004, we have sold three schools and closed two schools. After we sell a school, we could
be subject to claims by the new owner, parents and educational authorities for financial liabilities related to our
previous operation of the school and could also be subject to unforeseen liabilities. Our reputation may also
suffer in the event we sell one of our schools and parents react negatively to such disposal. In addition, if a new
owner does not operate the school in a way that is up to our established standard, our reputation could suffer by

38


-----

association, even though we no longer have any control over the operations of the institution. If this were to
occur, the attitude of parents or actual and potential students of our other schools could be adversely impacted,
which may damage our reputation.

We may incur costs if we are required to respond to such disputes, and any liabilities that emerge or continue
after the closure of a school could materially and adversely affect our current business, prospects, results of
operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_We may face termination of our leases or be unable to renew them on acceptable terms, and, if we wish to_**
**_relocate, may incur additional costs if we terminate a lease._**

As of August 31, 2018, we had over 90 leasehold properties (including playing fields) in connection with our
school operations. A number of our leases will expire within the next five years, none of which are governed by
the Landlord and Tenant Act, which restricts landlords’ ability not to renew such leases. If we are unable to
renew our leases for our school facilities on favorable terms or if our leases are terminated by the landlord:

- we may be unable to find a new property with the amenities and in the location we require, which may lead
to closure of the school;

- we may have to relocate to a property for the school in a less desirable location;

- we may face increased competition from other school operations in the new location in which we operate;

- we may have to relocate to a school with facilities that do not meet our requirements;

- we may incur significant costs in connection with identifying, securing and relocating to the replacement
location, including costs for occupying the property; and

- our schools may experience significant disruption in operations and, as a result, we may be unable to collect
tuition fees for the period of disruption or retain students at that school.

Certain of our leases are subject to periodic open market rent reviews and as a result, we are susceptible to
changes in the property rental market and regular increases in our rent costs. To the extent that the rental increase
based on current market rates for such leased properties outpaces the increase in our revenues, the renewal of
such lease may adversely affect the profitability of the relevant schools. In addition, if we are unable to renew
any of our leases for our school facilities on favorable terms or at all, or if these leases are terminated, this may
materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
Furthermore, terminating any of the leases for the properties in which our schools operate could be costly. Some
of our leases do not contain break provisions that permit us to terminate the lease prior to the expiration of the
contractual term, and if we wished to do so, we could be liable for the costs of defaulting under the lease. If we
are not able to negotiate satisfactory termination arrangements, we may not be able to relocate a school to a more
desirable location within the scheduled timeframe or we may incur significant costs in doing so, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

**_If one or more of the landlords of our school properties do not perform their obligations under the terms of_**
**_the lease or the landlord changes during the term of the lease, we could suffer disruptions in the operations of_**
**_our schools and our costs could increase._**

A good working relationship with the landlords of our school properties is fundamental to the successful
operation of our schools and can also generate additional property development opportunities that support our
growth. During the term of our leases, the landlord of one or more of our schools could change, for example due
to its insolvency or the sale of the underlying property, and we may need to develop and establish a relationship
with a new contracting party. The new landlord may have interests that conflict with ours, may be less willing to
expand the school’s capacity or improve its facilities or be a less reliable counterparty in fulfilling its obligations
under the terms of the lease.

We may not be able to renew our existing school leases on favorable terms or at all including, particularly in
jurisdictions where the leases do not have the benefit of statutory or contractual rights of renewal. For example,
in Singapore, the renewal of our leases is subject to Singapore Land Authority approval and we cannot assure
you that we will be able to renew the leases for the Australian International School or Stamford American
International School upon their expiry in 2031 and 2040, respectively.

In addition, if an existing landlord or a new landlord does not comply with their covenants as set out in the lease
for any reason, we could suffer disruptions in the operations of our schools and our costs could increase, which
could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

39


-----

**_Our insurance may be inadequate, and premiums may increase substantially._**

Our business involves an inherent risk of liability. We may also be required to obtain additional insurance to
comply with the relevant regulatory requirements in certain jurisdictions. The activities in which we engage pose
risks related to the health and safety of our students and other beneficiaries of our services. We believe that our
current insurance in each of our segments is consistent with industry practice within the relevant markets,
however claims in excess of our insurance coverage or claims not covered by our insurance could arise.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain liability insurance coverage in the future on
acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim against us which is not covered by or is in excess of our insurance
coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and
financial condition. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, may also have a material
adverse effect upon our reputation and our ability to attract or retain students. Any such claims may also increase
the premiums payable by us for our insurance coverage.

**_We may lose the services of members of our senior management team._**

Our success depends in part on the continued skills, efforts and motivation of our directors and senior
management team. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience changes in our senior management for
a variety of reasons. In addition, key personnel could leave us to join our competitors. Loss of the services of key
members of senior management or experienced personnel may be disruptive and cause uncertainty. If one or
more members of our senior management team or key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their
present positions, including for health, family or other personal reasons, we may not be able to replace them
easily or at all. An inability to attract and retain qualified senior managers or key personnel in a timely manner
could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial
condition.

**_We collect and retain personal data, and unauthorized disclosure of this personal data due to a systems failure_**
**_or otherwise could have a damaging effect on our business._**

We maintain records which include personal data, such as academic and medical records, addresses, family
information, credit card details and other information. If the security measures we use to protect personal data are
ineffective due to a systems failure or other reasons, including staff errors, we could be subject to liability,
including fines from local regulations, claims of invasion of privacy, impersonation, unauthorized purchases or
other claims. In addition, one of our employees, independent consultants or third-party contractors could,
fraudulently or otherwise, misuse personal data and we could be liable for such misuse.

We could incur significant expenses in connection with remedying any such security breaches, complying with
compulsory notification requirements, settling any resulting claims against us and providing additional protection
from the threat of these breaches.

In May 2018 the European General Data Protection Regulations came into force imposing stricter requirements
on data controllers handling the data of EU citizens and giving local regulators the ability to impose much higher
fines and penalties for breaches of the regulations. If we do not implement and maintain suitable controls and
processes that comply with the regulations it may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain students, cause
our reputation to deteriorate and materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations,
cash flow and financial condition.

**_We are dependent on our IT systems and any failure to maintain reliable and effective IT systems may_**
**_materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

We have multiple information technology (“IT”) systems in place across the jurisdictions in which we operate.
As a result, schools may have difficulty sharing information and curricula and we may have difficulties taking
advantage of synergies and growth opportunities across our different schools. These difficulties and related risks
are heightened by the growth of our business. We may incur greater costs and achieve fewer savings as a result of
maintaining multiple IT systems than we would if the number of IT systems in use across all our jurisdictions
were rationalized. These increased costs and lost opportunities for savings and synergies could materially
adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to invest in technology that differentiates our service or provides adequate protection against data loss
and inappropriate use of digital content could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition. We are currently implementing global finance, HR and CRM systems across
the entire Group and are continuing to evaluate the possibility of introducing new technology in order to:

- improve efficiencies, including the centralization of certain back office functions;

40


-----

- improve our ability to share information and leverage digital assets;

- improve the visibility of internal and external information required to monitor performance across our
schools; and

- differentiate our service through the use of technology and digitization.

The implementation of any new technology will be subject to various risks, including delays, cost overruns, lack
of participation by third-party suppliers once the technology is implemented, or failure to deliver expected cost
savings and operational efficiencies, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the
implementation of any new technology will require substantial management time and resources that otherwise
would be directed to managing our business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of our management,
if significant, could affect its ability to support our existing operations and implement our operational strategies.
To the extent that we decide to implement new technology and we are unable to achieve successful
implementation of such technology, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could
be materially adversely affected.

**_We are subject to rules arising from our ownership structures in Thailand and Vietnam._**

Thai law requires that all school permit holders must be at minimum majority owned by Thai persons, which
would include Thai corporations. British Education Management Systems Company Limited (Thailand)
(“BEMS”), which operates St. Andrews International School Sathorn, St. Andrews International School Green
Valley and St. Andrews International School Sukhumvit 107 in Thailand, is majority owned by a Thai national
nominee. Pursuant to other contractual arrangements that have been put in place with such Thai national
nominee, all rights and 95% of the economic benefits to the shares of BEMS have been unconditionally assigned
to Cognita Asia Holdings Pte. Ltd. St. Andrews Dusit Campus Company Limited (Thailand), which operates St.
Andrews International School Dusit, is majority owned by Thai nationals and Thai corporations, with an option
for Cognita Asia Holdings Pte. Ltd. to call for a further 20% of the shares held by Thai nationals. There can be no
assurance either that the relevant Thai regulator will not challenge or find that the ownership structure violates
current legislation or that the relevant regulations governing foreign ownership of schools in Thailand will not
change in the future. If the ownership structure of our schools in Thailand is found to be non-compliant with
current or future relevant regulations, we may be unable to operate our schools or we may have less control over
our schools that are subject to such ownership structures. In addition, we may experience disputes with our
nominees or ownership partners. As a result, our business related to these schools could be materially and
adversely affected.

Vietnam law allows up to 100% foreign ownership of an educational establishment. However, pursuant to Decree
86, which came into effect on August 1, 2018 foreign owned education institutions are subject to certain
restrictions, including a 50% cap on intake of Vietnamese national students in kindergarten, primary and
secondary schools, which are not applicable to non-foreign owned education institutions. International Education
Corporation Joint Stock Company, which owns and operates the International School of Ho Chi Minh City
(“ISHCMC”) and International School of Ho Chi Minh City American Academy (“AAVN”), is a foreign owned
entity incorporated under the laws of Vietnam. ISHCMC and AAVN are owned and operated under a 40 year
investment certificate which was granted in 1993, prior to the changes in Vietnam law, and have obtained a
“Certificate of Operation Registration” that had allowed the schools to enroll Vietnamese national students in
primary school and secondary school level without any cap on the total number of the Vietnamese national
students. ISHCMC and AAVN voluntarily limit the number of Vietnamese students enrolled, however if we were
to expand our operations to other schools in Vietnam which required a new investment certificate, International
Education Corporation Joint Stock Company could become subject to Decree 86, which would impact our ability
to enroll Vietnamese national students and may make ISHCMC and AAVN less competitive in the market. Lotus
Education and Training One Member Company Limited, which owns and operates International School Saigon
Pearl (“ISSP”), is owned by an entity incorporated under the laws of Vietnam. It is structured as a local entity
without foreign ownership and therefore is not subject to the cap on intake of Vietnamese national students.
There can be no assurance that the relevant regulator will not challenge our interpretation of the guidelines or that
the regulator will not amend the guidelines such that Decree 86 may be deemed to apply to us. Any such action
which limits our ability to enroll Vietnamese students in our schools in the future could adversely affect our
business prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition in Vietnam.

**_We may not have adequate protection for our intellectual property, and we may infringe the intellectual_**
**_property of others._**

Our individually branded schools, trademarks and other intellectual property rights distinguish our schools and
the services provided from those of our competitors and are critical to our ability to continue to develop and
enhance our reputation.

41


-----

We cannot assure you that the measures we have in place to protect our brands will be adequate, that we have
secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our brands or that third parties will not
infringe upon or misappropriate our brands, trademarks and other intellectual property. Policing the unauthorized
use of our brands can be difficult and expensive and litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our brands
or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of such potential litigation
may not be in our favor and any success in litigation may not be able to adequately protect our rights. Such
litigation may also be costly and divert management’s attention away from our business. Our intellectual
property is also vulnerable to unauthorized use in some countries in which we operate where local law may not
adequately protect it.

We may also be subject to claims by third parties that our brands or trademarks infringe their intellectual
property rights. If we are to be found liable for any such infringement, we could be required to pay substantial
damages, or comply with injunctions against us to prevent further infringement, which could affect our business,
prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, such infringement claims could harm the
perception of us by our students, parents and staff or otherwise harm our reputation.

**_We may be subject to investigations or challenges with respect to our tax liabilities or subject to changes in tax_**
**_legislation that may adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, negative public attention_**
**_regarding such investigations or challenges or our tax structure in general could damage our reputation._**

From time to time, we are involved in discussions or disputes with tax authorities regarding our tax liabilities,
which may lead to revisions to our tax liabilities, and therefore impact our financial position. In such a case we
may be subject to negative public attention, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation or relations
with our stakeholders including parents of students, employees or other third parties. The current political climate
and recent political and media focus on austerity increases the risk of such discussions or disputes with tax
authorities.

We have received assessments from HMRC in the aggregate amount of £1.57 million with respect to PAYE
amounts payable in connection with our operation of a Growth Securities Ownership Plan in the years ended
August 31, 2010 to 2013. We have challenged these assessments and are currently subject to an inquiry from
HMRC in respect of these periods. On the basis of the inquiries received to date, we estimate that the maximum
potential liability of the Group in relation to the operation of the GSOP in the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010
to August 31, 2013 would total £0.5 million, due to the indemnity to recover certain amounts from employee
participants. If this inquiry or other tax audits, investigations or challenges render decisions that are unfavorable
to us, we may be required to pay settlement amounts, and penalties, which may adversely impact our financial
position. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any such investigations or challenges, such proceedings could
result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial time and resources to defend ourselves.
Furthermore, tax legislation may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that adversely affects our
current or future tax structure and tax liability.

**_We may not realize any or all of our anticipated pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA included in this_**
**_Offering Memorandum._**

We have prepared Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions to present an
estimate of our Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 after giving pro forma effect to the
estimated EBITDA contribution of (i) the full year impact of the Woodland, ABS and Santo Tomas acquisitions
(completed during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018) and the CEM acquisition (completed in November
2018), (ii) confirmed September 2018 enrollment, (iii) estimated in year growth in Average FTE students from
October 1, 2018 and (iii) the Adjusted EBITDA from four acquisitions subject to non-binding memoranda of
understanding as if each were completed on September 1, 2017. See “Summary—Summary Financial and
_Operating Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial Information.”_

Each of the adjustments is based on our current estimates, and involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated
future results. In particular, the pro forma adjustments intended to give effect to the full year impact on our
Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 of acquisitions completed within the year or slightly
thereafter are inherently speculative. These pro forma adjustments are based upon financial information,
including budgeted data, that was made available to us in connection with the acquisitions together with our
management’s assumptions and estimates. Therefore, for periods prior to the acquisitions of these schools, we
have included in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information related to the schools on the basis of
estimated figures for such periods which have been prepared by their previous management together with
external advisors. Moreover, these businesses were previously operated by separate entities from which they

42


-----

have since separated and as such, their historical financial performance may not be indicative of their financial
performance both on a standalone basis and within our Group. The Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was prepared
without being reviewed by our auditors and the adjustments and assumptions used in preparing the metrics may
prove to be inaccurate or may be affected by other factors that have not been accounted for. The Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of the operating
results of our Group no undue reliance should be made in respect of such information.

Any pro forma adjustments related to acquisitions that have not yet been completed carry the risk that the
acquisition and the associated EBITDA contribution may never be realized. Such acquisitions are independent
and the signing and closing of any acquisition opportunity is not conditional on the signing and closing of any of
the other acquisition opportunities. There can be no assurances that all or any of such acquisitions will take place.
The acquisitions may not be completed for any number of reasons, including, among others, default by the sellers
under the purchase agreements or memoranda of understanding, as applicable, or failure by us or them to meet
the relevant conditions for any such acquisition. Furthermore, the EBITDA adjustments related to the potential
acquisitions are themselves inherently uncertain for similar reasons as those related to the adjustments for the
completed acquisitions, i.e. they are based on materials provided to us by the sellers’ management team and/or
financial advisors as part of the acquisition process.

Moreover, these businesses were previously operated by separate entities from which they have since separated
and as such, their historical financial performance may not be indicative of their financial performance both on a
standalone basis and within our Group. The Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was prepared without being reviewed
by our auditors, consultants or experts and the adjustments and assumptions used in preparing the metrics may
prove to be inaccurate or may be affected by other factors that have not been accounted for. The Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of the operating
results of our Group no undue reliance should be made in respect of such information.

We have also made further adjustments based on a number of assumptions related to the contribution to Adjusted
EBITDA from the enrollement confirmed for the beginning of the September 2018 year at constant fiscal year
2019 prices and an increase in Average FTE Students during the school year such as operational efficiencies
related to higher utilization which may not ever materialize.

**Risks Relating to our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees._**

After the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. As of August 31, 2018, on an as adjusted basis after
giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had
as adjusted net total debt of £705.4 million. The terms of the Indenture will permit the Company and its
subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including indebtedness in connection with any future
acquisition and borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes in the Offering, including:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt obligations;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal
of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development or other general
corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement will, among other things, restrict our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to,
and on the transfer of, assets to the Restricted Group;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- enter into unrelated businesses or engage in prohibited activities;

- consolidate or merge with other entities; and

- impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities_
_Agreement.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance future operations and_
capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interests.

Our Senior Facilities will in addition require us to comply with a springing leverage ratio with respect to the
Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities.” Our
ability to meet this financial covenant test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure
you that we will meet it. A breach of this test could result in an event of default under the Senior Facilities
Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under our Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to
applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel
the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities,
together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Senior Credit
Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross
default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under
our Senior Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and
the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of
our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or
in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce against any Collateral
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to sustain_**
**_our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior Credit
Facilities and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future
performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk
_Factors,” many of which are beyond our control._

The Notes will mature in 2026 (while the Term Loan B Facilities mature in 2025). At the maturity of the Notes
and any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital
resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or we are otherwise restricted from
doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance our indebtedness. The
type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the conditions prevailing in the
financial markets. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on
terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities or capital expenditures or sell
assets or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if
at all. In addition, the terms of our Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and any future debt may limit our
ability to pursue any of these measures.

-----

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future,_**
**_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate_**
**_our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be structurally
senior to the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. In addition to the
Revolving Credit Facility and the B2 Facility, certain operating facilities and certain hedging obligations, we
may incur additional indebtedness that is permitted to share in proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral.
Although the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions,
and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related
risks that we now face would increase. Increases in our total indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade of the
ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could negatively affect their trading price. In addition, the
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations or entering other
arrangements that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, such as non-recourse receivables
securitization financings and sale and lease-backs.

**_The loans under our Senior Facilities Agreement and certain of the Local Facilities bear interest at floating_**
**_rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cashflow._**

The loans under our Senior Facilities Agreement and certain of the Local Facilities bear interest at floating rates
of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR or LIBOR (as the case may be), as adjusted periodically, plus a margin.
These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest rates were to increase
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates,
there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging
itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate
any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are the
subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are
already effective while others are still to be implemented including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation
(EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the
absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of
regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017,
the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would
have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate
(“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary
sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key nearterm priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of
SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to
the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of
SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April
2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no
longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause
such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in
methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in
certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of
administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to
the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and
conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not
limited to the Senior Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as
well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported
EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at
floating rates of interest.

**_Commitments representing amounts not drawn under the B2 Facility by March 31, 2019 will be automatically_**
**_cancelled._**

The Term Loan B Facilities include a committed €52,551,816 facility (i.e. the B2 Facility), which is available for
the direct or indirect financing or refinancing of the Specified Acquisitions. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, €4,363,797 million is outstanding under the B2 Facility which was drawn in connection with the
Santo Tomas Acquisition and the CEM Acquisition. The B2 Facility is subject to certain conditions, including
that the Specified Acquisitions must be signed on or before March 31, 2019 and completed on or before
September 30, 2019. In the event that any of the Specified Acquisitions is not signed commitments representing
amounts not drawn under the B2 Facility by March 31, 2019 will be automatically cancelled and such source of
liquidity will not be available to us. If we fail to sign the Specified Acquisitions by March 31, 2019, we may not
be able to finance the Specified Acquisitions from other sources and, as a result, we may not be able to complete
the Specified Acquisitions and benefit from the incremental EBITDA contribution from the targets of the
Specified Acquisitions. In the event that we draw the B2 Facility but fail to complete any of the Specified
Acquisitions by September 30, 2019, such related drawn amounts will be subject to a mandatory prepayment.
The Specified Acquisitions may not be completed for a number of reasons, including, among others, default by
the sellers under the purchase agreements or memoranda of understanding, as applicable, or failure by us or them
to meet the relevant conditions for any such acquisition. See “—Our substantial leverage and debt service
_obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the_
_Notes and the Guarantees.”_

**_Our hedging and other derivative arrangements may not effectively or sufficiently offset the negative impact_**
**_of interest rate fluctuations._**

We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain
interest rate risks. Historically, we have made use of hedging arrangements to protect our business against
interest rate fluctuations on our local credit facilities. In addition, following the Refinancing Transactions, we
may enter into foreign currency swaps with respect to the Notes. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or
may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from foreign currency variations.
Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may negatively impact operating results.

**Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure**

**_The Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations and is dependent on payments from its_**
**_operating subsidiaries in order to provide it with funds to meet its obligations._**

The Issuer is a holding company and was formed in order to enter into the Transactions. The Issuer conducts no
business operations of its own, and has not engaged in, and will not engage in, any activities other than those
relating to its finance activities. As at the Issue Date, the Issuer has no material assets. Therefore, the Issuer will
be dependent upon payments from other members of the Group to meet its obligations, including its obligations
under the Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order for it to meet its obligations under the Notes,
including, through payments under the Intercompany Loan. The amounts available to the Issuer from the other
relevant members of the Group will depend on the profitability and cash flows of such members of the Group and
the ability of such members to make payments to them under applicable law or the terms of any financing
agreements or other contracts that may limit or restrict their ability to pay such amounts. Various agreements
governing our debt restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move
cash within the Restricted Group. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Local Facilities” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” Applicable_
tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. In addition, the members of the Group that do not
guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

**_The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum does not cover the Issuer or Bidco._**

We have not included any financial statements of the Issuer or Bidco either on a stand-alone basis or
consolidated with its subsidiaries in this Offering Memorandum. Although the Issuer and Bidco do not engage in
any activities other than those relating to holding the shares of their subsidiaries, these entities may have external
liabilities that are not subordinated to the Notes and have experienced losses in the past and may do so in the
future. The limited information that we have provided regarding these external liabilities and losses on an
unconsolidated basis is not based on IFRS accounts in all cases and thus may not be comparable to, and could
differ significantly from, such information prepared on the basis of IFRS. Since the financial information of the
Target that is presented in this Offering Memorandum does not include the results of the Issuer or Bidco, such
financial information may be of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Issuer.

**_Your right to receive payment under the Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior debt of the_**
**_Guarantors._**

The obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees will be contractually subordinated in right of
payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all existing and future obligations in respect of senior debt of such
Guarantor. This senior debt includes, in the case of Lernen Bidco Limited, its obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and certain hedging arrangements. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the
ability of the Issuer and the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial
and senior to the Guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of
senior debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any
payment may be made pursuant to the Guarantees. Until the senior debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any
distribution to which holders of the Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in the
Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior debt of such Guarantor as their interests may
appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor, holders of senior debt of such Guarantor may
recover more, ratably, than the holders of Notes, in respect of the Guarantees.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Guarantees provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Notes for the benefit of the holders of
senior debt of such Guarantor;

- that if a payment event of default on any senior debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, such
Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Guarantee until such event of default is remedied or
waived;

- that if any other event of default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that permits
the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such event of default, such
Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or pursuant to its Guarantee (subject, in each
case, to certain exceptions), until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such event of default
and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is delivered; and

- that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the the Majority
Second Lien Creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to the Guarantees, except in certain
circumstances.

The Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have
standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or
take legal actions against each of the Guarantors and by accepting any Note each such holder will be deemed to
have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies
and recourse under the Guarantees in the event of an event of default by the Issuer or a Guarantor.

**_Certain of our subsidiaries (including but not limited to those located in Spain, Chile, Brazil, Hong Kong,_**
**_Thailand and Vietnam) will not guarantee the Notes, and the Notes and each of the Guarantees will be_**
**_structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries_**
**_and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference
shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary
over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims under any intercompany loans and claims by
holders of the Notes under the Guarantees.

In the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, enters examinership, is liquidated,
reorganized, or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such company; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in
full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as a direct or
indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries for the Notes. Our subsidiaries

47


-----

organized in Spain, Chile, Brazil, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam and certain other subsidiaries in Singapore
will not guarantee the obligations under the Notes in line with the Agreed Security Principles. As of August 31,
2018, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, on a
consolidated basis, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €50.2 million in
outstanding debt. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Local Facilities.” Any of the debt that
our non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture will rank structurally senior to
the Notes and each Guarantee and any debt we incur that is secured on property or assets that do not form part of
the Collateral securing the Notes will be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the property
or assets securing such indebtedness, including indebtedness of the Senior Credit Facilities.

In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding-up, our assets that secure debt
ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only
after the secured debt has been repaid in full from those assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to
pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding.

**_The Notes will not be initially guaranteed by all the Guarantors._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantor. We will agree in the Indenture,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, to take such necessary actions so that the Post-Completion Date
Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
(or supplemental indentures) substantially in the form attached to the Indenture and accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement by no later than 120 days after the Acquisition Completion Date. We expect that the Post-Completion
Date Guarantors will be the following: (i) Australian International School Pte Ltd (Singapore); (ii) Stamford
American International School Pte Ltd (Singapore); and (iii) Cognita Schools Limited (UK). The Notes
Guarantees will be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor (including its guarantee of the Senior Facilities (as defined herein)). As of and for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2018, the Guarantors represented, based on their contribution in our consolidated financial
statements, 59% of revenue, 70% of Adjusted EBITDA and 52% of assets of the Group. See “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Target and Future Guarantor Coverage.” There can be no assurance that we_
will be successful in procuring such additional Guarantees within the time period specified. The initial Notes
Guarantees by the Issue Date Guarantor and the Notes Guarantees of the Post-Completion Date Guarantors will
be limited as set forth in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_**
**_by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Indenture will include language to the effect that each Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as
any other obligation under the Security Documents will be limited so as to ensure compliance with local law. The
Guarantees, security interests and other obligations will also be subject to applicable corporate and other laws. In
general, these laws prohibit companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for the purpose of acquiring
their shares and limit the circumstances in which companies can transfer economic benefits to their shareholders
outside the payment of properly declared dividends. They also provide for limitations that affect the rights of
creditors generally in case an entity becomes insolvent. See “Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law
_Limitations” for more details regarding limitations on Guarantees and security interests in England and Wales_
and Singapore.

Moreover, certain transaction documents are governed by U.S. law judgments rendered by a U.S. court will
generally not be directly enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which the majority of the assets by which the
Notes are secured are located. Instead, in many of these jurisdictions, as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S.
judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of the factors the court will
consider involve a considerable amount of discretion. And even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is
enforceable, the process may take a lengthy amount of time to complete. For all of these reasons, an investment
in the Notes involves unique risks that may not apply or apply differently in a more conventional secured bond
offering. If any of these risks materializes, your ability to collect payments of principal and interest under the
Notes may be materially adversely affected.

**_Claims of our senior secured creditors will have priority with respect to their security over the claims of_**
**_holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._**

The holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit
of the holders of the Notes because the lenders under the Term Loan B Facilities, creditors under the Revolving

48


-----

Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other senior debt or obligations permitted to be incurred
and secured over the Collateral on a senior basis to the Notes under the Indenture) will have a prior claim on all
proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Collateral and any enforcement sale with respect to such
Collateral and the Notes will need to share any remaining proceeds from such enforcement with any other
secured creditor. In addition, on the Issue Date, the Term Loan B Facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility and our
finance leases are, and the Indenture will permit future senior debt to be, secured by liens over property and
assets that do not secure the Notes. Therefore, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the Term Loan B
Facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility and future senior debt or obligations to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such indebtedness (other than the Collateral).

If the proceeds realized from the enforcement of Collateral exceed the amount owed under the Term Loan B
Facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility and such other senior debt or obligations, any excess amount of such
proceeds will be paid to the Trustee on behalf of itself and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes (as
beneficiary of junior-priority interests, in the case of Collateral, and as an unsecured creditor, in the case of all
other property and assets). If there are no excess proceeds, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is less than
the aggregate amount of the obligations under the Notes and any other indebtedness permitted under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to share in the Collateral with the Notes on a pari passu basis, the
holders of the Notes will not fully recover (if at all) under such Collateral. In addition, with respect to all property
and assets that are not part of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes would have only an unsecured claim against
the Issuer’s and the relevant Guarantors’ remaining assets.

As of August 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis and after giving effect to the Transactions, we had as adjusted net
secured debt of £480.4 million, which is secured by liens on assets that do not secure the Notes or secured by
liens which rank in priority to the liens securing the Notes. We have the ability to borrow up to £100 million
under our Revolving Credit Facility, which will be secured by collateral (including the Shared Collateral, as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). We may also issue further indebtedness which will be entitled to rank
pari passu with or senior to the Notes in right and priority of payment and which will be entitled to share in the
Collateral with the Notes on a pari passu or senior-priority basis. In the event that any such debt is issued, the
creditor voting rights in respect of the Notes will be diluted proportionately to the amount of indebtedness
incurred.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the_**
**_Notes, and in the event that the Collateral is enforced, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities, certain_**
**_operating facilities, counterparties of certain hedging obligations as creditors of senior indebtedness will be_**
**_paid with the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes._**

The Notes Collateral will consist of security over all of the issued capital stock of Lernen Bidco Limited and any
present and future receivables owed to the Issuer by Lernen Bidco Limited under any intercompany loan, in each
case, on a second ranking basis and, in each case, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and to any thin capitalization or tax issues, any legal or corporate benefit restrictions and the Agreed
Security Principles. Not all of our assets secure the Notes and we will not be obligated to take action to perfect all
liens on assets that do secure the Notes. If we default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only
to the extent of the value of the Collateral underlying their security interest. We may incur additional
indebtedness in the future, which may also be secured by the Collateral. Your rights to the Collateral may be
diluted by any increase in debt secured by the Collateral on a similar or more favorable basis to the Notes or a
reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. If the value of the Collateral is less than the value of the claims of
the holders of the Notes together with the claims of the other secured creditors, those claims may not be satisfied
in full.

No appraisals of any of the security have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the Offering.
The fair market value of the security is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, our
ability to implement our business strategy, the ability to sell the security in an orderly sale, general economic
conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of any security
would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the security
at such time, general, market and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of the sale. There also can
be no assurance that the security will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of any liquidation or
foreclosure is uncertain. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets
located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the
property subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability of the Security
Agent to realize or foreclose on the security. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that
entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. By the nature of our business, some or all of the
security may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event that a bankruptcy case
is commenced by or against us, if the value of the security is less than the amount of principal and accrued and

49


-----

unpaid interest on the Notes and other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from
and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the security will be sufficient
to pay the obligations due under the Notes.

In the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a
particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries,
the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and, in the case of the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security
Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to require granting of, or
payment or enforcement under, a guarantee or security in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed
Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any guarantee or security
provided by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets.
Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the Guarantees and Collateral provided by us
and our subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the guarantees and security may also be affected by local
law limitations. See “—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability.”_

Furthermore, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral will be
applied to repay claims of the lenders under the Senior Facility Agreement, c counterparties of certain hedging
obligations and creditors of other priority indebtedness in priority to the holders of the Notes and other secured
obligations. Holders of the Notes may therefore receive less from the proceeds of the Collateral in an
enforcement or insolvency scenario than if they were not required to share the proceeds.

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by certain of the Collateral securing the obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities,
certain operating facilities and certain hedging obligations. We can incur additional indebtedness and other
obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral under the terms of the Indenture.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the senior secured creditors and (until
the senior secured creditors are repaid in full) not the holders of the Notes, will be entitled to form an intstructing
group and direct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement also
provides that subject to certain exceptions the agent of the creditor class who wishes to deliver an enforcement
instruction must first consult with every agent or representative of the other creditor classes (only to the extent
that the Collateral is secured in favor of such creditors), certain creditors and the Security Agent for a period of
not less than 10 Business Days. After an initial consultation period, the Security Agent may act upon the
instructions of an instructing group, which, prior to the date that the Senior Facilities Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt any debt that ranks pari passu with such facilities) is discharged, shall be the holders of (i)
prior to the date on which any public securities which rank pari passu with such liabilities are issued, 66 [2]⁄3 of
such senior indebtedness and (ii) after such date, 50% of such senior indebtedness.

These arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Collateral in a manner that results in lower recoveries
by holders of the Notes. Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence
enforcement action against the Company or its subsidiaries during such period, the Company or one or more of
its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could
otherwise be impaired or reduced in value.

If the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an
enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Guarantees
and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release_
_of Liens.”_

**_The Company and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation of the_**
**_business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control
over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from certain of the Collateral. So long as no
default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among
other things, subject to the terms of the Security Documents, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the
Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral such as selling, modifying,

50


-----

factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments,
including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which
could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an
enforcement of the liens on the Notes.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_**
**_Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees,” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release
_of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or the Guarantors_
as a result of an enforcement action, then claims under the Notes and the Guarantees may be released or
transferred. Your ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral may be released and retaken in connection with the
refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Issuer has confirmed in writing to the Security
Agent that it has determined that it is either not possible or not desirable to implement any such refinancing on
terms satisfactory to it by instead granting additional Collateral and amending the terms of the existing
Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new
“hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency
administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such
Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral
and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the delay in or failure to grant or perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and the grantor of the security. The liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable
to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens or if it has been agreed that such perfection steps shall
not be taken on the basis that such steps have undesirable effects. For the avoidance of doubt, the Security Agent
will not have any obligation to take any steps or actions necessary to perfect any such liens.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the
Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider
until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the
security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the
debtor and there has occurred an event of default under the Indenture. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is
determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a
later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in
the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have limited obligations to assist the Security Agent in perfecting the security
interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will
monitor, or that the Issuer will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that
should constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly create and perfect the security
interest in such property and rights acquired post completion. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor
the acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute Collateral or the creation or perfection of
any security interest. The failure to create or perfect such additional security interests may adversely affect the
relevant security interest and/or the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes.

In the case of the laws of England and Wales, where the security is registerable, provided that such security is
registered, then the ranking of security interests granted by security providers incorporated in England and Wales
is, subject to certain exceptions, determined by the date on which they were created. Accordingly, a security
interest created on a later date over the same Collateral which has been duly registered will take priority over an
earlier created security interest which has not been registered within the appropriate timeframe. The ranking of
certain other security interests is determined by the date of registration or, as applicable, the date of notice.

51


-----

In the case of Singapore law, where the security is registerable, provided that such security is registered (and, if
necessary, stamp duty is paid in connection with the same), then the ranking of security interests granted by
security providers incorporated in Singapore is, subject to certain exceptions, determined by the date on which
they were created or in the case of registerable security over land, the date the mortgage is registered.
Accordingly, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral which has been duly registered
(and, if necessary, stamped) will take priority over an earlier created security interest which has not been
registered within the appropriate timeframe. The ranking of certain other security interests is generally
determined by the date of registration or, as applicable, the date of notice.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the
Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the
ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the assets comprising the Collateral is, or will be, free and clear
from third-party prior ranking security rights or other interests, such as security interests arising under standard
contract terms or by operation of law. Any such rights or interests would adversely affect the value of the
Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose the Collateral.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in Collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a thirdparty to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. As a result, the fair market value of such Collateral is
subject to, among other things, the availability of approved buyers. In addition, we cannot assure you that the
Security Agent will be able to obtain any consents required to enforce the Collateral or to realize the security
interests in the Collateral. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when
required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to
foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may decline significantly.

**_The security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees may be declared unenforceable against third parties_**
**_under fraudulent conveyance laws._**

In the case of the laws of England and Wales, section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986 applies in respect of
transactions entered into at an undervalue defrauding creditors. This provision can be used at any time and any
person prejudiced by the relevant transaction may apply to the court to have such transaction set aside or to have
their interests protected by other means. Remedies granted under this provision are not limited to transactions
entered into within set time limits and transactions can be avoided even if the company was solvent at the time of
the transaction.

In the case of Singapore law, section 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, Chapter 61 of
Singapore, applies in respect of transactions to defraud creditors. Any transaction that is impugned pursuant to
this section, upon proof of the intention to defraud creditors, is voidable at the instance of a person who has been
prejudiced by such transaction. This provision applies to “every conveyance of property,” and not only
transactions at an undervalue.

In addition, under Singapore insolvency law, if a Singapore company goes into liquidation, and has entered into
certain transactions at an undervalue within the last five years, or has entered into a transaction by way of unfair
preference in the past six months (note that a two year period applies in the case of a transaction with a connected
party), those transactions may be liable to be made void or voidable.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to you. The_**
**_ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but
will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide, and the Intercreditor Agreement
provides, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence,
holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in
respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

52


-----

**_Enforcement of the Collateral and the Guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws applicable to England and Wales. In the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the
Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively
enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial
uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various laws in multiple
jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the
ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees. See also “Certain
_Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.”_

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales and Singapore may not be as favorable to you as the U.S._**
**_bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and the Guarantors are incorporated under the
laws of various jurisdictions, including England and Wales and Singapore. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings
with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English or Singapore
insolvency law, as applicable. English or Singapore insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors as the
laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_and Local Law Limitations—England and Wales” and “Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations—_
_Singapore.”_

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency
and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other,
including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of
governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding and are
subject to change from time to time. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into
question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your
rights under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.
See “—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect their validity_**
**_and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by, and secured by certain assets of, the Guarantors or their
shares. The Guarantors are organized or incorporated under the laws of various jurisdictions, including England
and Wales and Singapore. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent
transfer and conveyance laws, equitable principles and insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of
judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantees and
the Collateral against a Guarantor or security provider. Courts may also in certain circumstances avoid the
Collateral or the Guarantees where the security provider is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following
discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally
applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and
insolvency statutes.

In insolvency proceedings, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors, the security providers or the appointed
insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and Collateral, and intercompany obligations generally,
as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes
certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Collateral
provided by the Issuer or such Guarantor;

- direct that the Issuer and/or the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any
Security Document to the relevant Guarantor or to the respective security provider or to a fund for the
benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or the security provider; and

- take other action that is detrimental to holders of the Notes.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Collateral is found to be a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure the holders of the Notes that we can ever repay

53


-----

in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee
and the liability of each security provider will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or
security not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.
The amount recoverable from a Guarantor or a security provider under the Security Documents will also be
limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court would apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or each security provider and whether a court would
give effect to such attempted limitation. Also, there is a possibility that the entire guarantee or security may be
set aside, in which case, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s entire liability may be extinguished.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct
that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for
the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court
found that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the
granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware
that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the
relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant
Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best
interests or for the corporate benefit of or to promote the success of the Guarantor; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted
under applicable law.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a security
provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or Collateral was created or that, regardless of
the method of valuation, a court would not determine that we or a Guarantor were insolvent on that date, or that a
court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or a security provider was insolvent on the
date the respective guarantee was issued or security was created, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such
Guarantee not constituting a preference, transaction at undervalue, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will
apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire
Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, transaction at undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance
and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in
respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other
Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid
or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the
Notes would be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy
our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, transaction at undervalue,
fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full
any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

The payment of dividends or principal or interest on the Intercompany Loan to the Issuer or to service our debt
obligations (including under the Notes) will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the
obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific
level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make
dividend payments or payments of principal and interest on the Intercompany Loan that reduce our distributable
profits and reserves to zero. We intend to make dividends and enter into the Intercompany Loan and other
intercompany loans to service indebtedness and for tax-planning purposes. We may not have distributable profits
and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we
distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. In addition, the payment under the Guarantees and the
enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate

54


-----

formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and
board resolutions.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States. Most
of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and
substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors
will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities
laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our directors and executive
officers located outside of the United States. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the
Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside
of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.
Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may
not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with England. There is,
therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in England of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action
to enforce a U.S. judgment in England. In addition, the enforcement in England of any judgment obtained in a
U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be
subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that an English court would have the requisite power or
authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in England on the basis of U.S. securities laws
violations. See “Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.”

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Singapore. There is,
therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Singapore of civil liability provisions based upon U.S. federal
securities laws. In addition, the enforcement in Singapore of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based
(whether in whole or in part) on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws will be subject to
certain conditions. There is also doubt that a Singapore court will enter judgments or grant remedies sought in an
original action brought in Singapore based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. See
_“Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.”_

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to
a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return
on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to
which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined
in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) may also have important tax
consequences as a result of foreign currency exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”_

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of a change of control as required by each Indenture and the change of control provision_**
**_contained in each Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important_**
**_corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer will be required to offer to
repurchase all the outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on
the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase. If a change of
control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that
we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that
the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then existing
contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an
event of default under, or acceleration of, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Local Facilities or other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such

55


-----

indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from the
Restricted Group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of
control may be limited by our then existing financial resources or the restrictions in the Senior Facilities
Agreement or other indebtedness. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing
funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such
indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to repay or refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from
repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes upon occurrence of a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to
obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture. To the
extent such default is not cured or waived within the applicable grace period, such default may, subject to the
provisions set out therein, result in a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other
indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in
voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in
the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not
contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer
and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem
the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain
outstanding. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and
its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the Notes or the
Guarantees under, the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may
not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have not
agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes or the Guarantees, and do not have any intention to
do so.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

56


-----

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected
by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which
the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no
active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes of such in the future which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and
other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the
future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by
one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financing
and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes.

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture that will govern the Notes will not apply to us if the notes are rated_**
**_investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P._**

Many of the covenants in the Indenture that will govern the Notes will cease to apply to the Notes during such
time, if any, as the Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, provided that at such time no
default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Although there can be no assurance that the Notes will
ever be rated investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain these ratings,
any suspension of the covenants under the Indenture that will govern the Notes would allow us to engage in
certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. Such transactions may
impair our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes. To the extent any suspended covenants are
subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event
of default under the Indenture that will govern the Notes on the basis that such actions would have been
prohibited by the covenants. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on
_Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive Notes (“Definitive Registered Notes”) are issued in exchange for book-entry interests
in the Global Notes (which will only occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the book-entry interests will
not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Notes. After payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream, we and the Paying Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest,
principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest,
you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in
Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise
any rights and obligations of a holder under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon
our solicitations for consents or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented
for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to

acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes._**

The interests of our shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of the
Notes. Investment funds or limited partnerships associated with or designated by JHAG control us. See
_“Principal Shareholders.” Our shareholders are able to appoint a majority of our Board of Directors and to_
determine our corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, our shareholders have control over our
decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the
approval of shareholders regardless of whether the holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in
their own best interests. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to
sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Senior Facility
Agreement, and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase
our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenue, each of
which could adversely affect holders of the Notes.

Additionally, certain of our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may from
time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Certain of our
shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as investment funds or limited
partnerships associated with or designated by JHAG collectively continue to own a significant amount of our
capital stock, JHAG will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. The
interests of JHAG may not coincide with your interests.

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent auditors._**

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements the independent auditor confirmed that
they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes) other than to us and our
members as a body with respect to the independent auditor’s report and to the independent auditor’s audit work
and opinions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would not permit such limiting language to be
included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered
under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the Securities Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other
court) were to give effect to the language quoted above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against
the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could
be limited. The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws
of many jurisdictions. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of the
holders of the Notes to bring any action against our auditors for damages arising out of an investment in the
Notes.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable_**
**_security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due_
to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at an effective
interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Offering are expected to be €255.3 million. The gross proceeds from the Offering
will be used to repay the amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility, together with the
Shareholder Contribution, the Term Loan B Facilities and cash on hand, was used to finance the Acquisition,
including repayment of debt and payment of costs and expenses for the Transactions. See “Summary—The
_Transactions.”_

The estimated sources and uses of the funds are shown in the table below. Actual amounts are subject to
adjustments and may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including accrued interest.
Actual sources, net of transaction expenses and fees for the Offering, may include other cash sources of the
Restricted Group.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and consolidated capitalization of:

- the Company, on an actual basis as of August 31, 2018; and

- the Issuer, as adjusted to give effect to (i) the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds
thereof, (ii) drawdowns and scheduled repayments of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and local
facilities prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, and (iii) the CEM Acquisition, in each case, as if they
had occurred on August 31, 2018. See “Summary—Recent Developments.”

The consolidated capitalization of the Company is not directly comparable to the consolidated capitalization of
the Issuer.

You should read this table together with the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Use of Proceeds,”
“Selected Historical Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum. The adjusted information below is illustrative only and does not purport to be indicative
of our capitalization following the completion of the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom.

Notes:

(1) Amounts in currencies other than Pound sterling are translated in this table at the relevant exchange rates as of August 31, 2018 in the
Actual column and at the relevant exchange rates as of the Acquisition Completion Date in the As Adjusted column.

(2) The as adjusted amount gives effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, £6.4 million cash used
on the Acquisition Completion Date for the repayment of existing local facilities and transaction costs as well as £0.6 million of cash and
cash equivalents at a holding company of the Company which was acquired as part of the Transactions. The as adjusted amount does not
reflect any cash that the Company has generated or used since August 31, 2018, other than to give effect to drawdowns and scheduled
repayments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (£12.8 million) and the Local Facilities (£2.5 million) through Acquisition
Completion Date, and a drawdown under the B2 facility of €1,745,519 (£1.5 million) and £4.2 million in cash used in connection with
the acquisition of CEM on November 6, 2018. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Bridge Facility will be paid from cash on hand.

(3) The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for a committed £100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. We currently expect no amounts to
be drawn in cash under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date.

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount loans outstanding under the Senior Facilities: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the B1
Facility, including the £200,000,000 GBP tranche and the €255,275,696 euro tranche, (ii) €2,618,278 under the B2 Facility drawn on the
Acquisition Completion Date in connection with the Santo Tomas Acquisition and (iii) an additional €1,745,519 under the B2 Facility
drawn on November 12, 2018 in connection with the CEM Acquisition. This does not include €48,188,019, available under the B2
Facility for Specified Acquisitions and which will be drawn in full to complete the acquisitions currently in exclusivity and given effect
in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. See “Summary Financial and Operating Information—Operating Data and Non-IFRS Financial
_Information” for the as adjusted net total debt and net secured debt leverage ratios and the adjusted interest expense coverage ratio, which_
assume the B2 Facility is fully drawn. See “Summary—The B2 Facility.”

(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.

(6) Represents the aggregate outstanding indebtedness under our local facilities which will remain outstanding following the Transactions,
giving effect to scheduled repayments under the local facilities prior to the Acquisition Completion Date (£2.5 million), repayment of
debt in connection with the Transactions (£70.0 million) and the effect of foreign exchange (£0.5 million). In addition, as of August 31,
2018, we also had combined £1.8 million in undrawn commitments under our Local Facilities. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Local Facilities”_

(7) Represents the present value of the minimum lease payments of finance leases in respect of property, plant and equipment of the Group
as of August 31, 2018, giving effect to foreign exchange (£0.3 million). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Finance
_Leases.”_

(8) All debt has been presented at its relevant aggregate principal amount, which excludes accrued interest and capitalized issue costs that
will be amortized over the life of the relevant debt. The as adjusted amount gives effect to drawdowns and scheduled repayments through
the Acquisition Completion Date.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**
**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

The Issuer was incorporated on August 28, 2018 for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer has
no material assets or liabilities (other than its shares in Lernen Bidco Limited and receivables under the
Intercompany Loan) and has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its incorporation and
participation in the Transactions. Consequently, we have not included any historical financial information
relating to the Issuer in this Offering Memorandum, other than certain limited financial data presented on a
consolidated basis “as adjusted” to reflect the Transactions. The consolidated capitalization of the Issuer is not
directly comparable to the consolidated capitalization of the Company. See “Capitalization.” See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—The Issuer is a holding company with_
_no independent operations and is dependent on payments from its operating subsidiaries in order to provide it_
_with funds to meet its obligations.”_

The Target was incorporated under the laws of Jersey on February 4, 2013 and is the indirect parent of the
Company and the holding Company for the Group. We have not included any historical financial data for the
Target in this Offering Memorandum.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on July 3, 2015 for the purposes of
facilitating the 2015 Refinancing Transactions. We have included in this Offering Memorandum and discuss
herein, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and
for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and, in each case, the related notes thereto. The use of
the term “Group,” “our,” “us” and “we” in this Offering Memorandum refers to the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended August 31,
2016, 2017 and 2018 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our consolidated financial information is
presented in Pound sterling.

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the related
notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum as well as the “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information” and the “Selected Historical Financial Information.”_

The statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future
performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion and analysis
are forward looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” and

Average Student Capacity and total average enrollment increased by 17.4% and 14.2%, respectively, between the
fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2018. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, our revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA were £430.5 million and £80.3 million, respectively.

Each Cognita school has its own unique ethos, with curricula and programs tailored to the needs of the students
and parents in the market it serves. Our distinctive offerings are underpinned by our commitment to deliver on
the three primary aspects of a Cognita education: high academic standards, strong character development and a
global perspective. We offer a wide and diverse range of curricula across regions to appeal to both local and
expatriate populations, including: the British curriculum, which is based on the standardized national curriculum
for England and which, with respect to our Spain segment, is supplemented with the Spanish national curriculum;
the International Baccalaureate (“IB”), a prestigious and rigorous internationally recognized diploma program;
the American curriculum (American Education Reaches Out standard, Massachusetts state standards, the
New York state standards and the Texas state standards); the Australian national curriculum; the Brazilian
national curriculum and the Brazilian (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Brazilian national curriculum;
and the Chilean national curriculum and the Chilean (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Chilean
national curriculum. We believe that this multi-curriculum approach allows us to better serve a variety of
attractive market segments while still preserving our academic and institutional standards. All of our schools
have an English language offering. In addition, we believe that, throughout our organization, we benefit from our
established reputation for providing academic excellence, high quality teachers and appealing school facilities.

Our philosophy of providing an “Inspiring World of Education” lies at the core of each of our schools’ unique
value proposition and sets the standards by which we operate and further develop our schools. We place

65


-----

significant emphasis on delivering individualized teaching and learning and providing exceptional student
outcomes, irrespective of students’ individual abilities. The majority of our schools follow a non-selective
admissions policy and we seek to support each student in achieving outcomes to the best of his or her ability
through our commitment to high standards in all aspects of teaching, care and school management. We
strengthen this approach by setting individualized learning goals which provide the right level of challenge and
support for growing minds and by implementing processes for regularly tracking and benchmarking student
attainment.

We employ a systematic approach to student enrollment and retention across our platform and use our global
scale and diverse expertise to build best practice in all our school.

We operate in developed and developing markets and our success in increasing enrollment reflects the
underlying strength and favorable dynamics of these markets. The developed and many of the developing
markets in which we operate (such as Vietnam and Thailand) are characterized by stable market fundamentals,
including a large middle class and a strong and established private school presence. Our success in the
developing markets in which we operate is based, in part, on the sizeable pools of expatriate families in these
markets, the increasing wealth among local families, each of whom value and demand high quality education for
their children and the increasing demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours.

Substantially all of our revenues are from private-pay sources without exposure to changes in government
funding.

Our operations are backed by a large and attractive portfolio of well-invested and well-maintained campuses and
facilities. Our real estate portfolio comprises of 126 sites, of which 36 are owned on a freehold basis and the
remaining 90 are leasehold properties on lease terms that we believe are favorable for our operations. The
average remaining tenure with respect to our leasehold school properties is 23 years. The book value of our real
estate portfolio at cost as at August 31, 2018 was £559.6 million. See “Business—Properties” for more
information on our properties.

**Operating Segments**

The Group is structured into the following operating segments:

**_Europe_**

We operate 46 schools in Europe, comprising 40 schools in the United Kingdom and six schools in Spain. The
segment accounted for £194.7 million or 45.2% of our revenue and £29.8 million or 32.9% of our Regional
Adjusted EBITDA and had a Regional Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.3% for the fiscal year ended August 31,
2018. For the same period, this segment had 14,459 average FTE students and an Average Revenue per FTE
Student of approximately £13,500.

**_Asia_**

We operate 11 schools in Asia, comprising four schools in Thailand, three schools in Vietnam, two schools in
Hong Kong and two schools in Singapore. The segment accounted for £181.2 million or 42.1% of our revenue
and £47.3 million or 52.1% of our Regional Adjusted EBITDA and had a Regional Adjusted EBITDA margin of
26.1% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. For the same period, this segment had 9,457 average FTE
students and an Average Revenue per FTE Student of approximately £19,200.

**_Latin America_**

We operate 14 schools in Latin America, comprising 12 schools in Chile and two schools in Brazil. This segment
accounted for £54.6 million or 12.7% of our revenue and £13.7 million or 15.0% of our Regional Adjusted
EBITDA and had a Regional Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.0% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. For
the same period, this segment had 14,464 average FTE students and an Average Revenue per FTE Student of
approximately £3,800.

**St Nicholas Joint Venture**

Before August 25, 2017, we owned a 50% stake in a joint venture, the St Nicholas Preparatory School (the “St
Nicholas Joint Venture”), which we have always managed as part of our day to day operations. On August 25,
2017, we acquired the remaining 50% of the joint venture company, which is fully consolidated in our results of
operations and financial position from the date of acquisition. However, in this discussion and analysis section,
we discuss certain figures that include 100% of the results of the St Nicholas Joint Venture for all of the periods

-----

under review, including prior to August 25, 2017. This presentation is not in accordance with the statutory
presentation in our audited consolidated financial statements or the consolidated interim management statements,
where we include only our 50% share of the St Nicholas Joint Venture’s results and financial position prior to the
date when we acquired full control.

**Information on a Constant Currency Basis**

Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations contains information comparing our performance
year-on-year on an actual historical basis and, in some instances, on a “constant currency” basis. Figures have
been given on a constant currency basis in order to eliminate the impact of changes in exchange rates, with both
previous year and current year figures calculated using the same exchange rates. We use figures prepared on a
constant currency basis both for our internal analysis and for our external communications, as we believe that
they provide means by which to analyze and explain variations from one period to another on a more comparable
basis than historical figures, since they eliminate the impact of exchange rates which do not directly impact our
organic performance. However, these figures provided on a constant currency basis are not measurements of
performance under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures.”_

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

**_Macroeconomic Conditions_**

Our operations are affected by general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we operate. As a
result of the importance of education spending for parents and the stability of the markets in which we operate, as
well as our focus on controlling our costs, we believe our revenue and profitability are relatively resilient to
fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions.

**_Enrollment and Average Revenue per FTE Student_**

Our results of operations are directly affected by our ability to maintain levels of enrollment and Average
Revenue per FTE Student. Our revenue grew during the periods under review principally as a result of increased
enrollment and fee increases above the rate of inflation due to our focus on quality and strong demand.

We have grown our average student numbers through filling pre-existing capacity as well as through greenfield
and expansion projects. During the periods under review, this growth resulted from (i) maturity of existing
schools as senior grades start to fill, (ii) capacity expansion at existing schools (which reduces short term
utilization and earnings but enhances longer term growth as schools fill over time), (iii) five acquisitions and two
greenfield expansions, and (iv) a reduction in student churn due to heightened focus on student retention.

Total enrollment in our schools has increased by a CAGR of 6.9% from 33,595 average FTE students as of
August 31, 2016 to 38,379 average FTE students as of August 31, 2018. Of this increase in enrollments, 2,415
Average FTE Student Enrollments were as a result of acquisitions. For a discussion of our historical Average
FTE Student Enrollment, see “—Key Operating Metrics—Enrollments.”

Average Revenue per FTE Student has increased from approximately £9,900 for the year ended August 31, 2016
to £11,200 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 primarily due to fee increases above consumer price
inflation and the impact of the portfolio mix of higher fee paying schools when considered on a Group basis, in
particular, the change in mix toward premium education offerings in Asia, including the recently opened
Stamford American School in Hong Kong. For a presentation of our historical Average Revenue per FTE
Student, see “—Key Operating Metrics—Average Revenue per FTE Student.”

**_Student Retention Rates_**

We monitor the proportion of students who are retained in our schools. Such data regarding Student Retention
Rates provides us with visibility of the number of students expected to attend our schools in future academic
years. We calculate Student Retention Rates as the number of students recorded in the opening roll for a period
less the number of students leaving during such period as a percentage of the total number of students in the
opening roll for a period.

Below are the Student Retention Rates for each of the periods indicated:

**Year ended August 31,**
**2016** **2017** **2018**

Student Retention Rates (in %):

Our Student Retention Rates are generally lower in our Asia segment due to the relocation of expatriate students.
In these markets, expatriate churn can have a positive effect on our financial results since application and
facilities fees are payable when new students enroll and take places vacated by outward bound expatriate
students.

**_Acquisitions, Capacity Expansion, Greenfield Developments and Disposals_**

We have a well-researched pipeline of acquisition and development projects. In the three fiscal years ended
August 31, 2018, the business has invested approximately £250 million in large development projects across the
three regions in which we operate. We have a disciplined approach to investments and look at compelling
opportunities for expansions at our existing schools as well as new schools to acquire. During the periods under
review, our most significant expansions and acquisitions were:

- the capacity expansion of our Early Learning Village in Singapore, which opened in July 2017 at a cost of
SGD 202.9 million (£109.8 million);

- the greenfield development of Stamford American School in Hong Kong in September 2017 at a cost of
HKD 1,042 million (£98.3 million), including HKD 751.4 (£67 million) for the acquisition of the building
and associated costs. A second phase of the development is currently underway and is expected to add
approximately 300 seats and be completed by August 2021, with an estimated cost of £16 million;

- the capacity expansion (construction of a new campus) of the International School Ho Chi Minh City
(“ISHCMC”), which completed in January 2018 at a cost of VND 370.4 million (£12.3 million) including
building prepayments and deposits of VND 247.9 million (£8.3 million);

- the acquisition of the remaining 49% interest in the Chile Schools Business (as defined below), previously
operated as a joint venture with Desarrollos Educacionales S.A. in September 2016;

- the acquisition of Bushcraft in May 2017 and the creation of the Active Learning Group (“ALG”);

- the capacity expansion of the GayLussac school in Brazil, which was completed in February 2018 at a cost
of BRL 12.4 million (£3.0 million);

- the acquisition of the American British School in Santiago, Chile in March 2018;

- the capacity expansion of the British School of Barcelona, which was completed in April 2018 at a cost of
EUR 6.4 million (£5.5 million);

- the acquisition of the Woodland Pre-Schools in Hong Kong in May 2018; and

- the capacity expansion of Southbank International School, which was completed in September 2018 at a
cost of £6.1 million.

**_Currency Translation_**

As a global business, we operate in multiple countries with different currencies. Each entity in the Group uses the
currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates as its functional currency for the purposes of
conducting its operations. Although we conduct our business in several major currencies, a significant proportion
of our business is conducted in Pounds sterling and Singapore dollars. Our consolidated financial statements are
presented in pounds sterling and, as a result, fluctuations in exchange rates between the Pound sterling and our
other operating currencies affect the translation of our results and the net assets and liabilities of our
non-United Kingdom entities. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising upon the translation of monetary assets
and liabilities from their operational currencies into pounds sterling are credited/charged to the income statement
of the Group. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities from their
operating currencies to pounds sterling are recognized as part of our income statement foreign exchange reserve
on our balance sheet. During the periods under review, the Pound sterling has generally weakened against the

68


-----

other currencies in which we operate. Future weakening of pounds sterling would be expected to positively
impact our operating results because 64.8% of revenues were generated in foreign currency for the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2018.

**_Cost Base_**

Our operating costs generally comprise costs incurred directly by our schools, regional offices and central office.
A number of our largest operating costs, including staff costs and rent, are largely incurred by our schools and
relate directly to the provision of our education services. These increase as we expand and have also gone up as
we have invested in the quality of teaching and education across our global platform to attract high caliber
teaching staff and improve student outcomes. Due to our fixed costs for rent, utilities and maintenance, we are
able to leverage our cost base as we increase enrollments and tuition revenue in our schools.

In addition, our regional offices incur costs to provide support services on a regional and local basis for education
management, finance, facilities, information technology (IT), human resources, legal and marketing functions, as
well as business development and mergers and acquisition activities within a region. Operating costs incurred on
a regional basis tend to be higher as a percentage of revenue in our newer regions due to the fact that we are
establishing our operations, and, initially, there are fewer schools that benefit from the provision of such services
in these new markets. We are able to increase cost efficiencies of these regional functions as we develop our
operations and increase the number of schools in each region.

**Key Operating Metrics**

In addition to financial performance, we use the following key operating metrics to manage our schools: Average
Student Capacity; Average FTE Student Enrollments; Average Revenue per FTE Student; utilization; and
Average FTE Staff. We monitor these operating metrics on a monthly basis as we believe that they are the most
reliable metrics for measuring and predicting the current and future profitability of our schools.

_Number of operational schools_

The total number of operational schools grew to 71, following the acquisition of CEM in November 2018.
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the number of schools grew to 70, with the acquisitions of the
American British School and Santo Tomas in Chile, the Woodland Pre-Schools in Hong Kong, along with the
opening of the Stamford American School in Hong Kong. The Avondale school in Singapore was also merged
with the Australian International School, Singapore during the year (and is now considered part of AIS for
purposes of the number of operation schools).

During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, the number of schools stayed at 67, with the acquisition of The
English Montessori School in Spain and the Avondale school in Singapore being offset by the sale of the

70


-----

Sackville school in the UK and the merger of the International School of Barcelona, Sitges with the British
School of Barcelona.

During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, the number of schools grew to 67. The closures of Chilton Cantelo
and Cranbrook schools in the UK were offset by the acquisition of the International School of Barcelona in Spain
and St. Andrews International School, Dusit in Thailand along with the opening of the Colegio Pumahue
Chicauma in Chile.

_Capacity_

We monitor our Average Student Capacity, which is the total number of students a particular school can
accommodate at any given time. We increased our Average Student Capacity by 17.4%, from 43,155 average
places in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 to 50,659 average places in the fiscal year ended August 31,
2018. This increase in capacity was primarily due to the acquisitions and openings of the schools described in
“—Number of operational schools” above.

Total Average Student Capacity increased by 13.3% in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. Of this increase, 8.1% was attributable to group expansion projects, most
notably in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Brazil, while the remainder of the increase represented the net
impact of acquisitions and divestments.

Total Average Student Capacity increased by 3.6% in the year ended August 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2016. The growth in capacity excluded the new Hong Kong school, which added a further
400 seats of capacity from September 2017, rising to 800 from January 2018. The growth is attributable to the
acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 financial years, along with the opening of the Colegio Pumahue Chicauma in Chile
and the new Hastings sites in Madrid Spain.

_Enrollments_

We monitor the average number of FTE students for any given year in a particular Cohort. For example, one
student in a school for half a year is 0.5 FTE, or one nursery student attending 50% of available sessions for a
year is 0.5 FTE. The number of FTE students fluctuates throughout the academic year as existing students flow
through to higher Cohorts from one year to the next, new students join at different Cohorts (both at the start of
and during the academic year) as well as due to student churn (including students who leave school either to go
to another school or expatriate churn).

As part of monitoring our student numbers, we focus particular attention on the number of inquiries and
applications by prospective families at each of our schools and the number of these that result in enrollments. In
our experience, the ratios of inquiries to applications and of inquiries to enrollments are useful indicators in
predicting the number of student enrollments. Thus, in our marketing and recruitment activities, we seek to
maximize the generation of inquiries and the conversion of these into enrollments.

The level of enrollments by region for the periods under review is shown below:

Average FTE Student Enrollments throughout the Group increased by 8.8% and Average FTE Staff numbers
increased by 9.7% in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to the prior comparable period. The staff
number increased at a faster rate than students due to the opening of new facilities.

Average FTE Student Enrollments throughout the Group grew by 5.0% and Average FTE Staff numbers grew by
4.7 % in the year ended August 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by acquisitions in 2016 and
2017 financial years, ongoing growth in Chile from the increasing popularity of the bilingual program, along
with strong growth in Spain following targeted development projects to increase capacity.

_Average Revenue per FTE Student_

We calculate Average Revenue per FTE Student for a period by dividing the revenue from our schools for the
period (including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018) by the

average FTE students for the period. Average Revenue per FTE Student is primarily affected by the tuition fees
we charge at each of our schools. Average Revenue per FTE Student, and therefore our revenue, is directly
affected by our ability to increase tuition fees year on year at each of our schools. We believe expatriates and
local families generally accept our price increases because of the importance they place on a quality education
for their children. As a result, we seek to increase Average Revenue per FTE Student at our schools at a rate in
excess of our cost inflation in the markets in which we operate. Our tuition fees are charged in the local
currencies of the countries where the schools are located. Therefore, our Average Revenue per FTE Student is
subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between these local currencies and our reported currency (which
is partially offset by a natural hedge resulting from the fact that our school operating costs are largely in the
relevant local currency).

The geographical mix of our students also affects our results of operations. During the periods under review, we
experienced higher student numbers in Chile (and to a lesser extent, Spain) where gross fees are lower than in
other countries (reflecting local market dynamics).

Within each of our segments, our Average Revenue per FTE Student is set out below:

_Utilization_

We measure utilization of total average capacity at any given time, which is calculated as the average number of
FTE students divided by total average capacity, expressed as a percentage. Utilization should be analysed over
time, as it is impacted by the opening of new sites and the expansion of existing sites, which adds capacity
immediately but typically takes time to mature. Utilization has remained relatively flat during the periods under
review, decreasing from 77.8% in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 to 75.8% for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2018. The small decrease was driven by the significant capacity expansion in the last two years,
particularly in Asia.

Utilization decreased by 3.2% to 75.8% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to the same period
last year due to the additional capacity opened in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Brazil. Utilization
increased by 1.1% to 78.9% during the year ended August 31, 2017, due to increased enrollments to fill existing
capacity.

_FTE Staff_

We monitor Average FTE Staff for any given year at a school as well as the average number of Group central
staff. Our total Average FTE Staff numbers have increased by 14.9%, from an average of 5,098 in the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2016 to an average of 5,858 in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. This increase in Average
FTE Staff has been primarily due to the acquisition of new schools, the opening of new facilities in Asia and
Brazil and an increase in staffing at our existing schools in line with increased enrollments. A discussion of the
evolution in the Average FTE Staff is included under “—Enrollments” above. We further monitor FTE staff
based on teachers and non-teaching staff. See “Business—Employees.”

**Principal Components of Our Results of Operations**

The following describes those line items that we consider key in understanding our results of operations.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is generated from the provision of educational services and the sale of related services and goods.
Principal components of revenue comprise amounts received from tuition fees and additional services, including
fees for enrollment, facility fees, technology, extracurricular activities, holiday camps, outdoor leadership and
development programs and catering. Although tuition fees are generally invoiced and collected in advance of the
education services being provided for such period, they are included on the balance sheet as deferred income or
fees in advance and recognized as revenue.

-----

With respect to facility fees that are paid when a student joins the relevant school and are generally
non-refundable under our policy, we recognize revenue over the average tenure of a student within the relevant
school.

**_Operating Costs_**

Our total operating costs include both underlying and non-underlying costs. Underlying costs represent the
expenses in connection with our day-to-day operations. Our key underlying operating costs comprise employee
benefit expense, other underlying operating costs and depreciation and amortization, all of which exclude the
costs in relation to the St Nicholas Joint Venture for the period until August 25, 2017 when we acquired the
remaining 50%.

_Underlying Costs_

_Employee benefit expense. Employee benefit expense comprises salaries, allowances, benefits, social security and_
pension costs in relation to our employees, including those based at our schools as well as staff based in our
central and regional offices.

_Depreciation and amortization of other intangibles. Depreciation represents the decrease in value of fixed assets_
as they are used in our business over time. The depreciation rate applied to fixed assets is determined based on
the estimated useful economic life of each fixed asset category. Fixed asset categories include freehold land and
buildings, short leasehold land and buildings, fixtures, fittings and equipment and motor vehicles. Goodwill and
intangibles with an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at each balance sheet
date.

_Other Operating Costs. These include:_

- _Property Costs. Property costs primarily relate to the cost of rent, running and maintaining our school_
property portfolio. The most significant components of our property costs include rent, business rates (i.e.
council tax), repairs and maintenance, utilities and cleaning. As of August 31, 2018, we leased 71% of our
properties (by number of properties), primarily in the UK, Spain, Hong Kong and Vietnam.

- _School Consumables. School consumables include the costs of learning aids and materials, including_
textbooks and library books, lesson equipment, information technology consumables and stationery. School
consumables also include catering costs for the provision of school meals to students.

- _Business Support Costs. Business support costs include legal and professional costs, as well as advertising_
and marketing costs.

_Non-underlying Costs_

Our non-underlying costs include acquisition and business exploration costs, restructuring costs, impairments of
assets, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets and non-cash share-based payment charges.

_Acquisition and Business Exploration Costs. Costs and expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or_
expansion opportunities including future business development into new countries and regions. These include
any legal and due diligence fees relating to potential or actual acquisitions as well as pre-opening expenses.
Pre-opening expenses include marketing and other expenses incurred prior to the opening of new schools or
facilities providing significant new capacity. Expenses incurred once the school or facility opens is treated as an
underlying cost.

_Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs mainly relate to employment cessation and associated legal costs, costs_
associated with the closing or selling of schools and exceptional advisory fees, for example, with respect to the
review and assessment of the Group’s child safeguarding policies and procedures.

_Impairment Costs. Impairment costs relate to the write-down of assets identified as being impaired._

_Share Based Payment Costs. Share based payment costs represent the income statement charge relating to the_
management incentive plan (MIP).

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income represents interest receivable, which during the periods under review, comprised mainly interest
receivable on cash balances. Finance income also includes unrealized exchange gains arising on the translation of
intragroup balances as well as gains on the fair value of forward contracts. It also included any dividends
receivable from the St Nicholas Joint Venture, for the period until August 25, 2017 when we acquired the
remaining 50% stake.

-----

**_Finance Expense_**

Finance expense represents interest payable, which during the periods under review, includes interest accrued
and paid on borrowings, including the Existing Notes, other bank borrowings, the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility and other loans. Finance expense also includes unrealized exchange losses arising on the translation of
intragroup balances as well as losses on the fair value of forward contracts and the amortization of capitalized
financing costs.

**_Share of Operating Profit of Joint Venture_**

For the period until August 25, 2017 when we acquired the remaining 50% stake, share of operating profit in
respect of joint venture consisted of our share of operating profit of the St Nicholas Joint Venture.

**_Taxation_**

Taxation on loss on ordinary activities consists of corporation tax, including our share of the tax charge of the St
Nicholas Joint Venture (where applicable), adjustments to taxes in respect of prior periods. In addition, our
taxation on loss on ordinary activities includes a charge or credit for deferred tax. Fluctuations in our effective
tax rate are primarily attributed to changes in the operating results of our subsidiaries, which are subject to
various tax rates and tax concessions in their respective jurisdictions.

**_Non-controlling Interest_**

Non-controlling interest represents profits attributable to minority shareholders of our majority-owned
subsidiaries. Minority interests in the period under review included the Chile Schools Business (prior to our
acquisition of the remaining 49% equity stake in September 2016) and the St. Andrews International School,
Dusit minority interest.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA (which we define as Operating Profit plus depreciation and amortization of
other intangibles and impairment) plus Non-underlying income and expenditure.

**_Regional Adjusted EBITDA_**

Regional Adjusted EBITDA means Adjusted EBITDA before central costs (relating to executive governance and
strategy, finance, compliance, mergers and acquisitions, legal, human resources, marketing and IT) and
excluding 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture Adjusted EBITDA (other than for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2018).

Group revenue increased by 11.8% (13.5% on a constant currency basis) from £385.2 million (£389.7 million
including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 to £430.5 million for
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 as a result of strong growth in student numbers and, to a lesser extent,
increased fee income.

Average student numbers increased (including the impact of acquisitions) by 8.8% between the two periods, with
an increase in Europe of 0.3%, Asia of 12.6% and Latin America of 15.9%.

Asia student growth was mostly driven by the opening of Stamford American School, Hong Kong, the
acquisition of Avondale Grammar School, Singapore, the opening of the ISHCMC secondary campus in Vietnam
and strong organic growth in Vietnam. Growth in student numbers in Latin America reflected strong organic
growth in Chile, supported by the success of the bilingual syllabus offered in five schools in Chile and the
GayLussac expansion.

_Operating Costs_

Underlying costs increased by 12.1% to £350.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from
£312.3 million (£315.8 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) in the comparable period of
2017. This reflects the impact of staff number and premises increases associated with the new capacity and
ongoing organic growth. We also incurred additional costs from further investments in educational capability,
leadership, technology and professional development across the Group.

Total FTE staff numbers increased by 518, or 9.7% to 5,858 in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from 5,340
in the comparable period of 2017. This increase included a net movement of 302 FTE related to acquisitions and
divestments, including the new Stamford American School, Hong Kong, the new ISHCMC campus in Vietnam
and the acquisitions of the American British School in Chile and the Woodland Pre-Schools in Hong Kong.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew by 10.2% (12.6% on a constant currency basis) to £90.8 million in the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2018 from £83.9 million (£84.9 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture)
in the comparable period of 2017 and represented a margin of 21.1% of revenue compared to 21.8% in the
comparable period of 2017. Much of this increase in Regional Adjusted EBITDA was derived from strong
growth in Spain and Chile associated with the infill of capacity and the growth in the bilingual education
programs in Chile. The decline in margin was due to the transitional impact of the lower utilization associated
with the opening of new capacity, particularly in Asia.

Group central costs decreased 4.1% to £10.5 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from £11.0 million
in the comparable period of 2017 due to £0.8 million of central costs being reallocated into Regional Adjusted
EBITDA.

_Non-Underlying Costs_

Non-underlying operating expenses of £8.7 million in the fiscal year-ended August 31, 2018 included costs
related to the Acquisition of £8.3 million along with a loss on disposal of £0.4 million, this compared to

75


-----

operating income of £0.3 million from a gain on disposal in the prior year. Restructuring costs of £0.9 million in
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (compared to a £7.1 million expense in the comparable period of 2017)
were due to a £2.9 million cost associated with restructuring programs, offset by the release of a provision
relating to the transfer of students from Avondale Grammar School to the Australian International School in
Singapore, which was no longer required. Non-underlying costs in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 also
included acquisition and business exploration costs of £5.9 million (compared to £7.8 million in the comparable
period of 2017), reflecting costs related to acquisitions completed in the period and £1.0 million of pre-opening
losses relating to unopened sites. There were also non-cash share-based payment charges of £14.8 million in the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to £0.2 million in the comparable period of 2017.

_Finance Income_

Finance income decreased by £4.3 million to £5.1 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from
£9.4 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to £7.3 million of
exchange gains on intercompany loans in the year ended August 31, 2017, being an exchange loss in the current
year (therefore recorded in finance expense), this decrease was offset by £4.2 million of derivative gains in the
year ended August 31, 2018.

_Finance Expense_

Finance expense decreased by £3.0 million to £47.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from
£50.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower expense
associated with a £15.2 million derivative loss recorded in the year ended August 31, 2017, offset by £7.0 million
of higher interest payable on bank borrowings associated with increasing debt levels and £7.4 million exchange
losses on intercompany loans in the current year.

_Profit/Loss for the Period Before Taxation_

The Group’s loss before tax was £56.5 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to a loss of
£17.8 million in the comparable period of 2017. The loss was primarily driven by a £16.9 million increase in
depreciation and amortization and a £12.8 million increase in impairment charges, partly offset by a £7.4 million
increase in Adjusted EBITDA.

_Taxation_

The Group’s tax charge increased by 6.4% to £6.8 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 from
£6.4 million in the comparable period of 2017. This was primarily due to the increase in profitability and higher
tax charges, particularly in Spain and Chile.

including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) in the year ended August 31, 2016. Revenue attributable to
new acquisitions during the year ended August 31, 2017 represented 2.8% of the increase on a constant currency
basis, with the remainder due to the organic increase in student numbers and annual fee inflation.

Student numbers increased by 5.0% in the year ended August 31, 2017, with Europe growing by 4.3%, Asia by
5.9% and Latin America by 5.3%. The Europe student growth was driven primarily by the schools in Spain,
partially offset by a decrease in student numbers in Chilton Cantelo and Cranbrook (closed in the year ended
August 31, 2016) and Sackville (sold in the year ended August 31, 2017) schools in the United Kingdom.

Asia student growth was mostly driven by the Dusit acquisition in Thailand in 2016 and continued growth in
Stamford American International School in Singapore and ISHCMC in Vietnam.

The growth of 5.3% in Latin America was largely due to the ongoing growth in the Chile schools with new
capacity and the bilingual program continuing to drive enrollment increases.

_Operating Costs_

Underlying costs increased 17.5% to £312.3 million (£315.8 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint
Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2017 from £265.8 million (£269.5 million including 100% of the
St Nicholas Joint Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2016. The increase reflected both organic and
acquisition growth in operations during the year.

Employee benefits expense are the main component of the Group’s operating costs. The underlying employee
benefits expense increased 16.8% to £205.0 million (£207.0 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint
Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2017 from £175.4 million (£176.9 million including 100% of the
St Nicholas Joint Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2016. The increase includes the impact of the
acquisitions made during the year, along with the growth associated the opening of the Early Learning Village in
Singapore and additional capacity in the Spanish schools. Additional employee costs were also incurred in the
Europe segment and Group central due to strategic investments in educational capability and obligatory costs
incurred from higher national insurance contributions in the UK.

Total FTE staff numbers increased by 242 or 4.7% to 5,340 in the year ended August 31, 2017 from 5,098 in the
year ended August 31, 2016.

Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew by 19.8% (9.0% on a constant currency basis) to £83.9 million (£84.9 million
including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2017 from £70.0 million
(£71.2 million including 100% of the St Nicholas Joint Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2016,
representing a margin of 21.8% of revenue in the year ended August 31, 2017 and 21.5% in the year ended
August 31, 2016. Much of this increase was driven by a strong growth in all countries in the Asia region utilizing
available capacity. The Asia Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew 29.9% (15.1% on a constant currency basis) on
revenues that grew by 23.5% (9.4% on a constant currency basis) in the same period.

The 16.2% growth in Latin America, on a constant currency basis, was driven by a 0.5 percentage points
improvement in the utilization rates from 76.4% to 76.9% in the year ended August 31, 2017. The improvement
in EBITDA was most notable in Chile, where a new bilingual program continued to grow and led to improved
margins.

Europe Regional Adjusted EBITDA fell 0.5% to £25.5 million (£26.5 million including 100% of the St Nicholas
Joint Venture) for the year ended August 31, 2017 from £25.6 million (£26.8 million including 100% of the
St Nicholas Joint Venture) in the year ended August 31, 2016, driven by lower EBITDA in the UK as a result of
targeted investment in the educational provision and higher national insurance contributions. The EBITDA in
Spain was impacted by new costs from two additional sites in Madrid for Hastings school, which we expect to
drive growth in future years.

Group central costs increased by 12.4% to £11.0 million in the year ended August 31, 2017 from £9.8 million in
the year ended August 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the full year impact following the transition
of our executive management team.

_Non-Underlying Costs_

Non-underlying costs for the year ended August 31, 2017 included one-off charges for non-cash impairments of
£2.6 million compared to £8.2 million for the year ended August 31, 2016, acquisition and business exploration
costs of £7.8 million (compared to £4.6 million for the year ended August 31, 2016) restructuring costs of
£7.1 million (compared to £7.1 million for the year ended August 31, 2016) and non-cash share based charges of
£0.2 million (compared to £4.0 million for the year ended August 31, 2016).

The impairment charge arose due to a reduction in the carrying value of fixed assets for two of the Group’s UK
schools following an impairment review in accordance with the Group accounting policy.

The acquisition and business exploration costs were higher in the year ended August 31, 2017 due to the increase
in M&A activity during the year.

The restructuring costs in the year ended August 31, 2017 included the costs associated with the sale of Sackville
School and the restructuring costs of closing the Avondale Grammar School property and moving the students to
the Australian International School, Singapore.

_Finance Income_

Finance income decreased from £29.5 million in the year ended August 31, 2016 to £9.4 million in the year
ended August 31, 2017, primarily associated with the lower exchange gains realized on intercompany loans
between Cognita Holdings Limited and subsidiaries. The intercompany loans were put in place to enable funding
to be passed into the Cognita Group from Cognita Financing plc (the issuer under the Existing Notes).

_Finance Expense_

Finance expense decreased by 31.7% to £50.2 million in the year ended August 31, 2017 from £73.5 million in
the year ended August 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by the lower fair value losses on foreign
exchange hedge instruments of £28.8 million partly offset by £4.8 million higher interest costs from the Existing
Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

_Profit/Loss for the Year Before Taxation_

The Group’s loss before tax decreased by 45.8% to £17.8 million for the year ended August 31, 2017 from
£32.9 million in the year ended August 31, 2016. The £15.1 million decrease in losses was primarily driven by
the £12.7 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA generated from organic and acquisitive growth, a £6.3 million
decrease in non-underlying costs driven by a smaller impairment charge and lower net finance expense partly
offset by £6.4 million of additional depreciation and amortization in the year ended August 31, 2017.

_Taxation_

The Group’s tax charge decreased by 4.5% to £6.4 million in the year ended August 31, 2017 from £6.7 million
in the year ended August 31, 2016. This was primarily due to an over-provision of current tax of £0.4 million in
Singapore in the prior year.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. The most significant components of our
working capital are cash and short-term deposits, deferred income and fees in advance, trade and other payables
and other current liabilities. Our ongoing operations require the availability of cash to service debt, fund capital
expenditure and to pay costs associated with the operation and acquisition of schools.

We believe that, based on our current level of operations, our operating cash flows and available amounts under
the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and debt service

-----

requirements for the next twelve months, subject to a variety of factors, including (i) our future ability to generate
cash flows from our operations, which is subject to certain general economic, financial, industry, legislative,
regulatory and other factors beyond our control, (ii) the level of our outstanding indebtedness and prevailing
interest, which affects our debt service requirements with respect to such indebtedness, (iii) our ability to
continue to borrow funds from financial institutions, (iv) our capital expenditure requirements and (v) contractual
and other legal restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to dividend cash. In particular, certain of our Local
Facilities restrict dividends or other distributions that can be made by the Group. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Local Facilities.”_

**Cash Flows and Working Capital**

The following table sets forth certain information relating to our historical cash flows. Please refer to the relevant
statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for more detailed information.

The table below summarizes the condensed consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated:

Notes:

(1) The restatement related to a reallocation of trade and other payables and acquisition of property plant and equipment in the 2017
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. As a result of the reallocation, cash flows relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment
decreased by £2.5 million and cash flows relating to movements in trade and other payables increased by the same amount. There was no
impact on the net increase in cash and cash equivalents.

The principal factors affecting our net cash inflows from operating activities in the periods presented are the
operating results of the Group along with the positive impact of changes in our working capital.

Our business benefits from structurally negative working capital, as fees are generally paid in advance of the
provision of services, with the highest cash inflow occurring prior to the commencement of the relevant
academic year. Our working capital cycles are also influenced by the geographical markets in which we operate.
School billing cycles differ from one jurisdiction to another and these billing cycles impact the negative working
capital position of the Group. Our working capital has become increasingly negative over time due to our
growing FTE student numbers and because of an increase in the proportion of Group revenue generated by our
schools in Asia that generally invoice further in advance compared to our other regions. Our net working capital
was £147.0 million as of August 31, 2016, £189.1 million as of August 31, 2017 and £190.2 million as of
August 31, 2018. The higher negative working capital at August 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was
principally due to £24.2 million of additional capital expenditures accrued in connection with the large
development projects concluding in Singapore, along with a £16.7 million increase in prepaid tuition fees. The
higher negative working capital as of August 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a growth
of £8.0 million in prepaid tuition and £6.5 million of transaction fees relating to the Acquisition being accrued as
at August 31, 2018, this has been largely offset by £18.8 million unwinding of capital expenditure accruals as of
August 31, 2017 relating to the completion of the Early Learning Village in Singapore and the Stamford
International School Hong Kong development.

Our operating cash outflows are also cyclical, but they do not necessarily track the seasonality of our billing
cycles. For example, we typically schedule maintenance of our facilities between academic years or school terms,
and this has an adverse effect on our working capital during such periods.

A significant proportion of our operating capital expenditure occurs in July and August of each year due to the
fact that most of our schools in the Europe and Asia have extended vacation periods during these months and we
can therefore undertake projects without disrupting the relevant schools during this time.

**_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_**

Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £4.4 million or 6.7%, to £70.9 million in the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2018 from £66.5 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, driven by improved
performance and growth in prepaid tuition.

79


-----

Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £13.9 million, or 26.4%, to £66.5 million in the year
ended August 31, 2017 from £52.6 million in the year ended August 31, 2016, due to the improvements in
operating performance from growing student numbers, higher prepaid tuition fees in net working capital and
management of operating costs. These positive increases were offset by cash outflows from prepaid rent and
deposits in Vietnam.

**_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_**

Net cash outflow from investing activities increased by £29.9 million, or 25.2%, to £148.8 million in the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2018 from £118.9 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. The increase was
primarily driven by the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of the American British School and
Santo Tomas in Chile and Woodland Pre-Schools, Hong Kong. Cash outflows due to acquisitions was
£71.0 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, compared to £19.0 million in the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2017.

Net cash outflow from investing activities decreased by £2.3 million, or 1.9%, to £118.9 million in the year
ended August 31, 2017 from £121.2 million in the year ended August 31, 2016. The cash outflow for acquisition
of property, plant and equipment in the year ended August 31, 2017 included £63.5 million related to the Early
Learning Village (Singapore) and the refurbishment of the new school property in Hong Kong. Cash outflow on
acquisitions was £19.0 million in the year ended August 31, 2017 compared to £6.7 million in the year ended
August 31, 2016.

**_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_**

Net cash inflow from financing activities increased by £13.1 million, or 18.0%, to £86.0 million in the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2018 from £72.9 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. In the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2018 the Group received proceeds for the issuance of the Existing Notes of £62.0 million (compared
to £99.3 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017), a net drawdown on the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility of £19.9 million, a net drawdown on a local debt facility in Hong Kong to acquire the Woodland
Pre-Schools of £14.0 million and £9.9 million (compared to £12.7 million in the fiscal year ended August 31,
2017) from the sale and leaseback of properties in the UK. This was partly offset by £38.6 million of interest
paid.

Net cash inflow from financing activities increased by £27.3 million, or 59.9%, to £72.9 million in the year
ended August 31, 2017 from £45.6 million in the year ended August 31, 2016. The increase was driven by the
£99.3 million proceeds of the two additional issues of the Existing Notes, £12.7 million proceeds from the sale
and leaseback of properties in the UK and the net £10.3 million drawdown on local debt facilities in Hong Kong
for the continued refurbishment of the Stamford American School property. This increase was partly offset by
the £32.2 million interest paid across the Group and the £11.6 million net repayment on the Revolving Credit
Facility in the year ended August 31, 2017.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Capital expenditure includes development capital expenditure and operating capital expenditures. Operating
capital expenditure represents investment that ensures the schools maintain their standards and compliance with
all regulations, as well as investment in IT infrastructure. Development capital expenditure represents investment
made to expand capacity at the Group’s schools and for the construction and development of other major
facilities that do not directly result in capacity expansion, but increase the property footprint.

The following table presents our capital expenditures during the periods indicated:

**Fiscal Year Ended August 31,**

We intend to fund capital expenditure to the extent possible with existing cash and operating cash flow. We
expect our capital expenditure in the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 to be in the range of £70 million to
£85 million. Such capital expenditure will be made primarily in relation to (i) the ongoing expansion of the
Stamford American School, Hong Kong, (ii) the refurbishment of the new St Nicholas Preparatory School
property, (iii) the refurbishment of the Pre-University facility in Madrid, (iv) the Long Close expansion in the
United Kingdom and (v) smaller investments at schools in the UK, Chile and Asia to enhance capacity and the
facilities available to the schools.

-----

Our other capital expenditures in the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 will relate to maintenance capital
expenditures and other development projects. These estimates are based on our projected capital expenditure
budget for the periods in question, which are subject to change in the event that additional acquisition, expansion
or other opportunities arise during the period or if existing projects are delayed or cancelled. Estimates of capital
expenditures for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 constitute forward-looking statements and speak only as
of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to change (see “Forward Looking Statements”). Our
development capital expenditures beyond the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 are discretionary, with
decisions being made on the basis of expected revenues and return on investment.

**_Fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and 2017_**

The Group had £78.9 million in capital expenditures in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (£102.5 million in
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017), a significant portion of which related to the completion of the Early
Learning Village, Singapore and the opening of the Stamford American School, Hong Kong. The capital
expenditure reported includes amounts spent on the regular renewal of the estate, along with amounts invested in
the expansion plans of our existing portfolio of schools. Amounts in currencies other than Pound sterling in this
section are translated at the exchange rate as of August 31, 2018, for the relevant currency.

_Operating capital expenditure_

In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, operating capital expenditure was £27.0 million (£22.6 million in the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2017). Expenditure during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 comprised
£16.0 million of facilities investment and £11.0 million on IT and computer equipment.

_Development capital expenditure_

As of August 31, 2018, we had development capital expenditures of SGD 196.7 million (£110.5 million) for land
and buildings for the Early Learning Village in Singapore, which opened in July 2017. We incurred completion
costs for the Early Learning Village of SGD 36.6 million (£20.6 million) in the fiscal year ended August 31,
2018.

We are investing approximately HKD 1,173 million (£114.9 million) to purchase and undertake a complete
refurbishment of the building now housing Stamford American School, Hong Kong. As of August 31, 2018, we
spent HKD 1,024.6 million (£100.3 million) on this project, with HKD 178.6 million (£17.5 million) incurred in
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The school opened in September 2017, with 345 students and now has
approximately 600 students at the start of its second year of operations.

**_Years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016_**

We had £102.5 million in capital expenditures in the year ended August 31, 2017 (£115.9 million in the year
ended August 31, 2016). The capital expenditure reported in the year represents amounts spent on the regular
renewal of the estate, along with amounts invested in the expansion plans of our existing portfolio of schools,
investment in the Early Learning Village (Singapore) and the refurbishment of the school property in
Hong Kong. Amounts in currencies other than Pound sterling in this section are translated at the relevant
exchange rate as of August 31, 2018.

_Operating Capital Expenditure_

In the year ended August 31, 2017, operating capital expenditure was £22.6 million (compared to £17.5 million
in the year ended August 31, 2016), an increase of 29.1% on the prior year.

_Development Capital Expenditure_

As of August 31, 2017, SGD 160 million (£89.9 million) in total had been invested in land and buildings to
develop the Early Learning Village in Singapore with SGD 97 million (£54.4 million) incurred in the year ended
August 31, 2017.

Development capital expenditure for the year ended August 31, 2017 included approximately HKD 93.3 million
(£9.1 million) associated with the ongoing refurbishment of the Hong Kong property. We invested approximately
HKD 845.7 million (£82.8 million) to acquire the property and undertake a complete refurbishment.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

We use various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, equity investments and various items, such as
trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from our operations. The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to raise finance for our operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes us to a number of financial risks, which are described in
more detail in note 25 to the financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2018. In order to manage our
exposure to those risks, in particular our exposure to interest rate risk, the Group enters into a number of
derivative transactions including, but not limited to, variable to fixed rate interest rate swaps. All transactions in
derivatives are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities and no transactions of
a speculative nature are undertaken.

The main risks arising from our financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, and
interest rate risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are
summarised in note 25 to the financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2018.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Critical accounting policies are those that require application of our management’s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments often as a need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain
and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their
significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate
may differ significantly from management’s current judgments.

The following are the critical judgements (other than those involving estimation uncertainty, which are discussed
below) that the management makes in the process of applying our accounting policies and that have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.

**_Classification of Singapore land lease—decommission liability_**

We entered into three land leases in Singapore, upon which school buildings have been constructed. The
contracts for two of these properties have reinstatement clauses whereby the landlord has the option of reinstating
the land to its original condition at our cost. Significant judgement is required in determining the likelihood that
reinstatement of the land will be required upon expiry of the lease. In making its judgement, management

82


-----

considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingent liabilities set out in IAS 37.
Following this work, management were satisfied that reinstatement costs are not probable and therefore that it is
most appropriate to disclose a contingent liability in the financial statements. Consequently an estimate of the
cost of dismantling and removing the buildings and restoring the sites to their original state at the end of the lease
term has been obtained.

**_Revenue recognition—Development/facility fees_**

We recognize development and facility fees over the tenure or expected tenure of a student within a school. In
order to do so, management determines the estimated tenure of a student in order to recognize development and
facility fee revenue over the period of service provision (i.e. the student’s tenure). The estimated tenure is
calculated on a school by school basis using an analytical method based on historical statistics, adjusted for
known or anticipated trends.

In making its judgement to apply this recognition basis, management considered the detailed criteria for the
recognition of revenue in the context of linked transactions set out in IAS 18 Revenue, in particular, the
considerations surrounding the length of service provision. Estimates made by management regarding the
calculation of tenure or expected tenure are discussed below.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty during the periods
under review that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities, are discussed below.

**_Share based payments_**

In accordance with IFRS 2, share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The valuation
requires a number of assumptions to be made based on factors outside our control, such as vesting period and
employee leavers.

**_Fair value of assets and liabilities attributable to business combinations_**

We account for all business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 which requires that all assets and liabilities
acquired are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition. In addition we perform a purchase
price allocation for each acquisition which identifies the separable intangible assets acquired as part of each
business combination. To establish the fair value of these separable intangible assets, we have to make
assumptions in relation to the potential future cash flows relating to these assets which involve assumptions
relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates and the useful life of such assets.

**_Impairment of goodwill_**

We are required to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually. This requires us to estimate the
value in use of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated. The value in use
calculation requires an estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU
and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate.

Management’s estimation of cash flows is based upon the current budgets and forecasts which are established
using management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The estimation of discount rate is considered on a case
by case basis and is achieved using a number of different methodologies which consider current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.

**_Provisions_**

We recognize a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date. The amount of
provision recognized is dependent upon management’s estimation of the likely outcome. At the balance sheet
date, provisions included amounts for onerous leases, lease dilapidations, employee termination and other
specific provisions.

Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis, according to management’s best current estimates and are adjusted
accordingly. Due to the inherent estimates and assumptions required upon the recognition of a provision, the
amount required to settle a provision can be different to the provision recognized at the balance sheet date.

**_Recoverability of trade receivables_**

An estimation is required to determine the recoverability of fees receivable when collection of the full amount is
not considered virtually certain. As of the balance sheet date, all schools assess the recoverability of trade

83


-----

receivables and record a provision for doubtful debts based on knowledge of individual circumstances as well as
historic empirical evidence of recoverability based on relative ageing of fees receivable.

Where there is evidence that a fee will not be recovered, the fee receivable asset will be derecognized and a bad
debt charge will be recognized in the income statement.

Due to the use of estimates, sometimes there will be a difference between amounts collected in future periods
related to fees receivable recognized at the balance sheet date. The difference between the carrying amount of the
fee receivable on the balance sheet and the amount actually collected in a future period is recognized in our
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

**_Deferred tax assets_**

In order to determine the recoverability and therefore recognition of deferred tax assets, we must estimate the
probable future taxable profits, against which the temporary timing differences can be utilized. This estimate
requires the use of current budgets and forecasts to determine future taxable profits and the timing of when these
will be realized.

Management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date and if it is considered
probable that all, or a part of the deferred tax asset will not be utilized within five years, the asset is
derecognized.

**Accounting standards issued but not yet effective**

The material new standards and interpretations that are endorsed by the EU but not yet effective up to the date of
issuance our financial statements for periods covered in this Offering Memorandum are disclosed below and will
be adopted where applicable when they become effective.

**_IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”_**

This standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities and
replaces the guidance provided by IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” with effect for
the year ending August 31, 2019. Early application is permitted. The key change for the Group arising from
IFRS 9 is in the requirement to use an expected loss model for recognition of bad debt provisions across the
whole Group, however, the impact on the Group is not expected to be material.

**_IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”_**

This standard deals with revenue recognition and focuses on the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenue and its related cash flows. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 “Revenue” and IAS 11 “Construction Contracts”
with effect for the year ending August 31, 2019. Early application is permitted. The adoption of IFRS 15 will
change the timing of revenue recognition with tuition and associated fees being recognized on a term time basis
instead of the current policy of being recognized evenly over the year. Management’s latest estimate of the
impact of adopting IFRS 15 in the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 is that it will decrease revenue by
approximately £1 million. The increase in opening deferred revenue as of September 1, 2018 and the
corresponding debit to equity reserve has not yet been finalized but is expected to be in the region of
£1-5 million.

**_IFRS 16, “Leases”_**

This standard considers the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and also deals with the
disclosure of useful information relating to leasing activities. The standard replaces IAS 17 “Leases” and a key
change is that most operating leases held by lessees will be accounted for on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 is
effective for the year ending August 31, 2020, with early adoption permitted, as long as the standard is not
adopted prior to IFRS 15. The full financial consequences of adopting IFRS 16 are being calculated by
management but are expected to be material. On transition to the new standard, the Group will derecognize
certain balances associated with IAS 17, including prepaid and accrued rent, onerous lease provisions and
recognize a new right of use asset offset by a lease liability. The net impact on equity is not expected to be
material. The adoption of the standard will increase Adjusted EBITDA by replacing rental charges in the income
statement with interest and depreciation charges.

**INDUSTRY**

**Large, Growing and Fragmented Global Private-Pay K-12 Education Market**

Private-pay K-12 education provides students and parents with an alternative to public education in an
environment where quality provision of public education in most jurisdictions continues to be strained by limited
public funding. The global market for private-pay K-12 education is large and fast growing. UNESCO estimates
that the global private-pay K-12 education enrollments grew from 288 million to 358 million at a CAGR of 4%
over the period from 2011 to 2017. Such growth is primarily attributable to an increase in student enrollment at a
CAGR of 7%, 4% and 1% in Europe, Asia and Latin America, respectively in the period from 2011 to 2017. In
addition to increased enrollments, in management’s experience, the growth in private-pay K-12 revenue is further
supported by the growth in tuition fees across most markets.

The private-pay K-12 education market is highly fragmented and is served by a large number of single-school
operators alongside a small number of global multi-school operators that have achieved significant scale[1], such as
Cognita, Nord Anglia and GEMS. We believe that multi-school operators enjoy a competitive advantage over
single-school operators not only in terms of the educational experience of students, parents, and teachers (in the
form of quality, standards, organizational structure, and training) but also in terms of better capabilities to pursue
expansion opportunities in-market and globally.

**Resilient and Stable through Economic Cycles**

The private-pay K-12 education market demonstrated strong resilience through the 2007 to 2009 global
economic downturn, primarily due to the inelastic nature of demand for quality education from parents, who
view education expenditures as largely non-discretionary.

For instance, Singapore has experienced consistent enrollment increases between academic year 2007 and
academic year 2018[2], despite the global financial crisis and a substantial decline in Foreign Direct Investment[3] in
2008 and 2009.

During the previous downturn in the UK, the decline in UK private enrollment was relatively muted vis-a-vis the
decline in UK real GDP growth. In management’s experience, the modest decline in enrollment was more than
offset by fee growth experienced over the same period.

**Demand and Supply Drivers**

We believe that the private-pay K-12 education market is supported by sustainable structural demand and supply
drivers, particularly given the highly fragmented nature of the industry and significant barriers to entry.

**_Demand Drivers_**

_Demand for English Language Education_

Due to the continued increase in importance of the English language in non-English speaking countries, we
believe that parents in these markets consider the quality of English teaching to be an important criterion when

choosing a school. Attending schools that teach in English better prepares children for post-secondary education
at universities that teach primarily in English. We believe parents increasingly emphasize the pursuit of education
in highly ranked universities, many of which are located in English-speaking countries, as a path to a successful
career. Obtaining quality primary and secondary education in English enhances the likelihood of admission to,
and success, at these top universities.

The growing demand for English language proficiency translates directly into increasing demand for private-pay
K-12 international and bilingual schools, where English is used extensively as the medium of instruction by
native English-speaking teachers. The English language learning environment distinguishes these schools from
other alternatives.

In addition to providing greater educational opportunities, we believe that proficiency in English provides
students with broader professional opportunities, particularly in English-speaking countries or in countries where
English is widely spoken, which provides the potential for higher earnings.

_Strong Academic and Career Outcomes_

Private-pay K-12 operators aim to provide an educational experience that tends to focus on stronger academic
outcomes relative to public school alternatives. Strong academics are among the highest ranked factors that
parents and students consider when choosing schools. Since most international private-pay K-12 schools focus on
internationally recognisable curricula, this focus drives demand from both local and expatriate students. For
example, for local students, curriculum preference tends to be driven by location of university aspirations abroad.
Similarly, for expatriates, the right curriculum options are critical for parents to ensure consistency of education
for their child, as well as portability of credits and ease of transfers to the next school.

_Local Student Population_

Across both developed and emerging markets, the local student population demand for private-pay K-12
education has seen consistent growth. For example, in many of our catchment markets, like Barcelona, Spain
where demand for English- and Spanish-based curricula exists, local students make up approximately 40% of the
student population in English based schools and 75% of the student population in Spanish based schools. Further,
in Sao Paulo, Brazil, approximately 93% of the student population is local. Similar trends are present in Asia and
the United Kingdom. Similarly, local students in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, make up over 70% of the student
population within the international and bilingual K-12 market segments. This growth has been driven by several
structural factors:

_Increases in Household Disposable Incomes_

Increases in household disposable income (especially in emerging markets) make private education more
affordable for an increasing number of families. In management’s experience, many of the markets in which we
operate have experienced significant growth in household disposable incomes.

_Greater Parental Aspirations_

In general, parents strive to provide the best possible educational opportunities for their children. In emerging
markets, with growing disposable income, parents realize the link between education and further advancement
and prioritize the education of their children accordingly.

_Expatriate Student Population_

_A Growing Global Expatriate Population_

Globalization has led to increasing FDI and an increasing number of expatriates. Studies indicate that expatriates
prioritize quality and continuity of education for their children, and seek schools that provide similar curricula
and academic standards as schools in their home country. We believe that an increasingly global and connected
economy coupled with continued FDI growth will drive continued demand for premium international K-12
education options.

_Employer Support for Education Spend_

To facilitate and encourage international assignments, employers of expatriates often reimburse parents for
tuition fees, make direct payment of fees to educational institutions or provide lump sum payments that parents
use to pay tuition, further supporting demand for quality private-pay K-12 education options.

87


-----

_Government Support for International Education_

In our end markets, governments have generally been supportive of and have encouraged the expansion of
private educational options. Governments support private education with international curricula, in part, because
high-quality international education supports expatriate families and FDI growth.

**_Supply Drivers_**

_Limited High Quality Public School Options_

Public investments in education tend to focus on access to education and prioritize national curricula. Parents
looking for a high quality education, especially one that offers international curricula, tend to focus on
private-pay opportunities for their children. As a result, parents who can afford private education generally turn
to that alternative across both developed and developing markets.

_Limited Investment in Capacity_

Investment in new or expanded capacity at public and single-operated private-pay K-12 schools in most of the
countries in which we operate has not kept pace with the increasing demand for quality education. In our end
markets, the majority of government funding is spent on teacher salaries, other current expenses, and
maintenance capital expenditures, with limited remaining funding available for capacity expansion.

Most single-school private-pay K-12 operators are resource constrained in terms of management’s ability to
expand capacity. Consequently, historically, many of these operators have not increased capacity even when
demand in their markets has exceeded supply, creating significant and attractive opportunities for multi-school
operators to expand capacity and deliver high-quality education and school options.

Additionally, when governments or regulators, such as in Singapore, plan capacity expansion for private-pay
K-12 international curriculum education, they generally expect operators to have a strong reputation and to be
able to demonstrate their scale and ability to finance such expansion as well as to have a proven track record of
meeting demand for private-pay K-12 international curriculum education. As we are one of very few multischool operators with global scale, we consider ourselves well-positioned to work with governments and
regulators to achieve desired capacity expansion.

**_High Barriers to Entry_**

The private-pay K-12 education industry has high barriers to entry, making it challenging for new entrants to take
market share from incumbents. Barriers generally include:

- Lead time required to build brand recognition and reputation, both on a local and global basis: due to the
intimate nature of education and its impact on lifelong trajectory, parents carefully consider the reputation of
schools for their children and tend to choose established schools;

- Challenges faced by inexperienced operators in securing government licenses and regulatory approval in
many jurisdictions; and

- Scarcity of real estate (especially in urban centres) in commercially viable areas that can accommodate a
sizeable campus with comprehensive high-quality facilities and the importance of a deep understanding of
the local real estate markets including relevant catchment dynamics and land acquisition process.

**_Revenue Visibility and Predictability of Cash Flows_**

The private-pay K-12 market is characterized by strong revenue visibility due to the nature of long student
tenures and yearly fee increases above inflation. In management’s experience, the market enjoys long average
student tenure: 8-10 years for local students and 4-6 years for expatriate students. School tuition is considered by
parents as “non-discretionary” spending. This visibility is further enhanced by competition among students to
gain a spot in prestigious private-pay K-12 institutions. This allows operators to effectively plan for the future,
and increase capacity knowing where future demand is likely to come from. Considering the inherent operating
leverage in the model, at high utilization levels, the market is able to achieve strong cash flows with a high
degree of certainty.

Our strategy and offerings are tailored to local market conditions. This enables us to target the most relevant and
attractive growth opportunities, while retaining consistent focus on delivery of academic quality and outcomes.
We summarize some of the key characteristics in our markets below.

**United Kingdom**

The United Kingdom has a long history of private-pay K-12 schools. Private-pay K-12 education provides
parents an alternative to state schools, which have been affected by austerity and limited capacity expansion.

_London_

The London private-pay K-12 education market accounted for approximately £3 billion in revenue and
enrollments of approximately 220,000 students in academic year 2018 according to the Market Report. Our
addressable market, defined by premium pricing strategies[11], represents approximately £2.7 billion in revenues
and enrollments of approximately 163,000 students. The Market Report estimates enrollments in this premium
private schools segment to grow at a compounded annual rate of 2.0% between academic year 2018 and
academic year 2023, and projected number of students to increase to approximately to 179,000 by the end of
such period.

According to the Market Report, the London private school market is highly capacity constrained, with an
average capacity utilization of approximately 90%. Adding additional capacity is difficult due to constraints on
school site availability, and enrollment growth has historically exceeded capacity growth across the market. The
Market Report indicates that fees in this competitive market have grown at an approximately 2.0-2.5% premium
to inflation over the last 5-6 years. This has allowed premium private-pay K-12 operators, like us, to compete
across the British and IB curricula spectrums with annual fees ranging from £12,000-28,000.

**_Spain_**

According to the Spanish Ministry of Education, the majority of the private-pay K-12 schools in Spain operated
on a “concerted” basis in the academic year 2016-2017, where a large portion of the fees and expenses were

subsidized by the government and offer Spanish curriculum, while the remaining private-pay K-12 schools
operate on a “fully private-pay” basis where fees are paid solely by parents and offer Spanish, International and
bilingual curricula.

Our schools in Spain operate solely on a “fully private-pay” basis and offer the British curriculum, which is
supplemented with the Spanish national curriculum and therefore are not dependent on government.

**_Barcelona_**

The Barcelona premium private-pay K-12 education market[12] accounted for £170 million in revenue and
enrollments of approximately 24,000 students in academic year 2018 according to the Market Report. The market
is comprized of English language-based International, Spanish bilingual and other language-based international
schools. We compete within the fast-growing English language-based segment[13], which encompasses £55 million
of revenue and is expected to deliver an approximate compound annual revenue growth rate of 11% between
2018 and 2023.

The premium private-pay K-12 market has historically grown at 11% annually since 2015. This premium private
market in Barcelona has been driven by enrollment growth of 6% annually and fee growth of approximately 5%
during academic year 2015-2018. Despite the recent capacity expansion of approximately 700 seats in the last
three years, the Market Report reveals that demand growth has outpaced supply growth, resulting in a segment
capacity utilization of approximately 87%. Per the Market Report, the market enrolls approximately 5,000 pupils
across 11 schools in 2018, which is expected to increase to approximately 6,000 students by academic year 2023,
implying a compound annual growth rate of 5% over the period.

_Madrid_

The Madrid premium private-pay K-12 market[14] is expected to account for £305 million in revenue and
enrollments of approximately 45,000 students in academic year 2018 according to the Market Report. Englishbased international, Spanish bilingual and other language international schools are the main segments in this
market. We compete in the English-based international segment[15] which is £125 million in revenue and enrolls
approximately 12,000 students. Revenue from this segment[16] accounts for approximately 41% of the overall
market revenue. The Market Report estimates enrollment in this segment of the market to grow at an annual rate
of 2.5% between academic year 2018 and 2023 to reach approximately 14,000 pupils by the end of the period.

According to the Market Report, Madrid’s premium private-pay K-12 market revenue annual growth rate of 7%
has been driven by enrollment growth of 4% and fee growth of 2.6% between 2015 and 2018. According to the
Market Report, the market has added approximately 2,000 seats over the last three years, but despite this
increase, capacity utilization remains at approximately 90%.

**_Hong Kong_**

The most common school type in Hong Kong K-12 market falls in the government aided segment; such schools
are run by charitable or religious organizations and are either fully or partially funded by the government. We
compete in the premium private segment of the market, which includes international schools, private independent
schools and English Schools Foundation. The premium international segment is comprized of schools typically
catering to a mix of both local and expatriate students as the international curricula offerings include British, IB,
American, Australian, Canadian and Montessori.

The overall Hong Kong Market is capacity constrained due to land scarcity with utilization levels consistently
exceeding 90%.

The premium private Hong Kong K-12 market[17] accounted for approximately £680 million in revenue and
enrollments of approximately 45,000 students in academic year 2018 according to the Market Report. The market
has shown consistent enrollment growth of 4 to 5% per year since 2011. The Market Report estimates market
enrollment to grow at 5.7% annually between academic year 2018 and academic year 2024 to reach 56,000
pupils by the end of the period.

12 Annual tuition fees above €3,000.

13 Annual tuition fees above €8,800.

14 Annual tuition fees above €3,000.

15 Annual tuition fees above €8,800.

16 Annual tuition fees in this segment range from £8,000 to £14,000.

17 Annual tuition fees above approximately £11,500 (HKD 125,000).

Current regulations are favorable for schools already operating in the region given limited site availability, long
lead time to gain licenses, approvals needed to build and expand campuses and rules around percentage of seats
allocated to non-local students and type of curricula that can be offered by international schools.

Due to historical capacity constraints and long waitlists, some premium schools in Hong Kong require an upfront
payment (debenture system) to secure their child’s admission to the school. These upfront payments help parents
gain priority admissions for their children and help schools raise funds for operating costs and other capital
outlays.

**Singapore**

The international K-12 education market in Singapore accounts for £900 million in revenue and enrolls
approximately 50,000 students and has the highest number of large scale[18] assets relative to other global
K-12 markets.

Our schools in Singapore cater exclusively to expatriate families and offer Australian, IB and American curricula
as regulations prohibit most Singaporean nationals from attending international schools. We compete within the
premium segment of this market[19], which is the largest segment and accounts for approximately £595 million in
revenue and enrollments of approximately 28,000 students according to the Market Report.

According to the Market Report, enrollment is estimated to grow at approximately 3% annually between
academic year 2018 and academic year 2023, reaching approximately 33,000 students by the end of such period.

Over the past decade, market revenue has grown at approximately 10-12% annually, driven by enrollment growth
of approximately 6% and a fee growth at a premium of 2-4% over inflation. The market has consistently operated
at capacity utilization levels of approximately 80-90% as new school sites are difficult to establish due to the
Economic Development Board’s control over supply and scarcity of potential sites. According to the Market
Report, the international K-12 market mainly caters to high-income expatriates; expatriates attending schools in
Singapore typically spend three to four years in the country, which leads to an approximate annual turnover of
25-30% of students.

**_Vietnam_**

Within the Vietnamese market, Ho Chi Minh City is the largest and most important sub-market for private-pay
K-12 education. Vietnamese nationals are only permitted to attend international curriculum schools subject to
certain limitations. The market for international curricula education is driven by a mix of expatriates and local
families. Demand for private-pay K-12 education in Vietnam is supported by the growing importance of English
language proficiency and the rising middle class. Our schools in this market cater to a combination of local and

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading global operator of private-pay K-12 schools currently comprising 71 schools in 8 countries
across Asia, Europe and Latin America with a total Average Student Capacity of 50,659 places and a total
Average FTE Student Enrollment of 38,379 FTE students for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. Total
Average Student Capacity and total average enrollment increased by 17.4% and 14.2%, respectively, between the
fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2018. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, our revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA were £430.5 million and £80.3 million, respectively.

Each Cognita school has its own unique ethos, with curricula and programs tailored to the needs of the students
and parents in the market it serves. Our distinctive offerings are underpinned by our commitment to deliver on
the three primary aspects of a Cognita education: high academic standards, strong character development and a
global perspective. We offer a wide and diverse range of curricula across regions to appeal to both local and
expatriate populations, including: the British curriculum, which is based on the standardized national curriculum
for England and which, with respect to our Spain segment, is supplemented with the Spanish national curriculum;
the International Baccalaureate (“IB”), a prestigious and rigorous internationally recognized diploma program;
the American curriculum (American Education Reaches Out standard, Massachusetts state standards, the New
York state standards and the Texas state standards); the Australian national curriculum; the Brazilian national
curriculum and the Brazilian (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Brazilian national curriculum; and the
Chilean national curriculum and the Chilean (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Chilean national
curriculum. We believe that this multi-curriculum approach allows us to better serve a variety of attractive
market segments while still preserving our academic and institutional standards. All of our schools have an
English language offering. In addition, we believe that, throughout our organization, we benefit from our
established reputation for providing academic excellence, high quality teachers and appealing school facilities.

Our philosophy of providing an “Inspiring World of Education” lies at the core of each of our schools’ unique
value proposition and sets the standards by which we operate and further develop our schools. We place
significant emphasis on delivering individualized teaching and learning and providing exceptional student
outcomes, irrespective of students’ individual abilities. The majority of our schools follow a non-selective
admissions policy and we seek to support each student in achieving outcomes to the best of his or her ability
through our commitment to high standards in all aspects of teaching, care and school management. We
strengthen this approach by setting individualized learning goals which provide the right level of challenge and
support for growing minds and by implementing processes for regularly tracking and benchmarking student
attainment.

We employ a systematic approach to student enrollment and retention across our platform and use our global
scale and diverse expertise to build best practice in all our school.

We operate in developed and developing markets and our success in increasing enrollment reflects the
underlying strength and favorable dynamics of these markets. The developed and many of the developing
markets in which we operate (such as Vietnam and Thailand) are characterized by stable market fundamentals,
including a large middle class and a strong and established private school presence. Our success in the
developing markets in which we operate is based, in part, on the sizeable pools of expatriate families in these
markets, the increasing wealth among local families, each of whom value and demand high quality education for
their children and the increasing demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours.

Substantially all of our revenues are from private-pay sources without exposure to changes in government
funding.

Our operations are backed by a large and attractive portfolio of well-invested and well-maintained campuses and
facilities. Our real estate portfolio comprises of 126 sites, of which 36 are owned on a freehold basis and the
remaining 90 are leasehold properties on lease terms that we believe are favorable for our operations. The
average remaining tenure with respect to our leasehold school properties is 23 years. The book value of our real
estate portfolio at cost as at August 31, 2018 was £559.6 million. See “Business—Properties” for more
information on our properties.

**Our Strengths**

**_Structurally growing market_**

We operate in the large and growing global private-pay K-12 education market. Although we operate globally,
our operations have a strategic focus on high value, growing, gateway markets such as: Singapore, Ho Chi Minh

-----

City (“HCMC”), Hong Kong, Bangkok, Madrid, Barcelona and London. According to the Market Report,
between academic years 2015-2018 (except for Hong Kong, which is measured from academic year 2014-2018),
Pre-K-12 revenue in these attractive segments grew at an annual CAGR as follows: Singapore (6%); HCMC
(14%); Hong Kong (10%); Bangkok (includes the Eastern Seaboard region) (8%); Madrid (7%); Barcelona
(11%) and London (6%). With existing facilities and experience in each of these gateway cities, we consider
ourselves well positioned to capture some of this market growth.

Revenue growth in the market is underpinned by high growth in private school enrollments compared to public
enrollments. According to UNESCO, in Europe there were approximately 16 million private K-12 students in
2016 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 8% from 2011 to 2017, in Latin America (including the Caribbean)
there were approximately 25 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 1%
from 2011 to 2017 and in Asia (including Central, Southern, Eastern and Southeast regions) there were
approximately 198 million private K-12 students in 2017 and their numbers grew at a CAGR of 3% from 2011 to
2017. Research by Euromonitor and Oxford Economics suggests that the relevant school going population for the
private K-12 market (aged 3-17 year olds) grew by a CAGR of 0.9% across our key European and Asian markets
from 10.6 million in 2015 to 10.9 million in 2018 and is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 0.9%,
reaching 11.4 million by 2023.

Demand for our schools is driven by both local and expatriate demand. For the fiscal year ended August 31,
2018, we had approximately 75% of local students and 25% of expatriate students. The exact percentage of
expatriate students varies significantly country-by-country. Our schools in Hong Kong and Vietnam rely on
approximately 49% and 58% expatriate students, respectively, whereas our schools in Chile and Brazil entirely
rely on local demand.

_Local Demand_

The developing markets, in which our schools target local families, have seen both strong parental aspirations not
met by public education and an increase in household disposable income in recent years, which has made private
education both more affordable and more desirable for an increasing number of families. Furthermore, we
believe that demand for private education in these regions is supported by the importance that parents and
students living in non-English speaking countries place on English language fluency, which, in turn, supports
demand for English language or bilingual schools such as ours, most of which have an English-language
offering. Additionally, there is an increasing desire among parents for their children to study abroad at foreign
universities. This in turn drives demand for private-pay K-12 schools, such as ours, that are perceived to have a
strong record of student placements to reputed higher education institutions. Many of our schools offer college
counseling and pre-university programs. We believe that these increases in disposable income, combined with
the demand for high quality education, are key drivers of growth in student enrollment in private-pay K-12
schools in these markets.

_Expatriate Demand_

The international markets in which we serve expatriate families, including Singapore, HCMC, Hong Kong,
Bangkok, London, Barcelona and Madrid are located in countries that have experienced strong GDP growth, with
an associated increase in expatriate populations who, we believe, prioritize quality and continuity of education
for their children and seek schools that provide a similar curriculum and academic standards as schools in their
home countries.

The following table shows the annual growth in GDP between 2015 and 2018 and the estimated annual growth in
GDP between 2018 and 2023 in our key regions, according to the IMF:

Note:

We expect this continued growth in GDP to result in growing expatriate populations in these countries and to
lead to increased enrollments.

In addition, many employers support expatriate education expenditure, which often takes the form of
reimbursements to parents for tuition fees, direct payment of fees to educational institutions or lump sum
payments that parents can use to pay tuition fees, if they so choose. Employer support influences demand for
high-quality education by affecting the affordability of private-pay K-12 education for expatriate families.

**_High quality education_**

In keeping with our philosophy of providing an “Inspiring World of Education,” we deliver a consistent,
principles-led framework for education which instils academic excellence, develops character and nurtures a
global perspective. In February 2017, we established an Education Advisory Board (“EAB”) to drive outstanding
educational practices across the Group and focus on evidence to improve academic outcomes. The EAB chaired
by Sir Kevan Collins, who is currently the Chief Executive of the Education Endowment Foundation (an
independent charity organization dedicated to the improvement of the educational attainment of underprivileged
students in English schools). The EAB’s mission is to accelerate academic improvement, build teacher capacity,
share effective best practices and establish external partnerships.

We have developed the “Cognita Way,” which is a framework we use to drive improvements at our schools and
maintain the high level of education valued by Parents through:

- _Energized Leadership: We believe that a key to driving improvement and academic success for our students_
is the academic vision of our Head Teachers. As such, we have a careful recruitment process for our school
Head Teachers. Once Head Teachers are hired, we endeavor to ensure stability over time by investing in our
leaders to inspire and share best practices they develop.

- _Personalized Learning: We focus on high quality learning in each classroom and on providing the right_
level of challenge and support for each student and we underpin this approach with data and predictive tools
to track student progress, benchmark individual student attainment and allow us to make informed decisions
based on the student’s particular situation.

- _People Growth: We view employing skilled and well-educated teachers at all of our schools as an important_
driver of the success of our product offering, and we have a professional and diligent approach to
recruitment and selection, with tailored practices specific to each region. We also invest in the professional
development of our teachers to help them to enhance their skills as well as to maintain high motivation

levels, for example, by providing career advancement prospects and the opportunity for teachers with high
potential to complete Masters programs in education. By operating as a global group, we also provide
internal opportunities to our teachers such as workplace shadowing and secondments, which may not be
available with single school operators. In addition, our global platform and Group central and regional
management teams free up school management and teachers from dealing with commercial and
administrative matters so that they have more time to focus on high quality teaching and learning.

- _Community: We actively seek to listen to and engage with the key people in each school community. We_
run a consistent system for gathering feedback across all regions through engagement with students (Voice
of Students, VoS), parents (Voice of Parents, VoP) and employees (Voice of Employees, VoE) and
utilization of CSAT tools such as Confirmit. Additionally, we work with a range of associations and
accreditation bodies and school inspectorates and engage with the global education sector through
participation in debates and conferences and partnerships with leading independent schools.

- _Innovation: We strive to maintain innovative curricula at our schools and constantly seek to implement new_
learning solutions and programs, both in the classroom, such as our full bilingual and English as an
Additional Language (EAL) programs, and outside of the classroom, such as our outdoor learning and
leadership development programs through our ALG division.

- _Brilliant Basics: We have developed systems and best-practices that are applied across our network to_
ensure that all of our schools are run according to the highest standards of safeguarding and health and
safety, allowing us to maintain accreditation and comply with local regulatory frameworks to help
streamline the operation of our schools. We have also implemented a global finance system and we are in
the process of implementing global solutions for HR, admissions and marketing.

- _International accreditations: We have received accreditations from the leading international educational_
organizations, such as Cambridge Assessment International Education, Council of International Schools,
COBIS, IB World School and NEASC. We are an outward looking organization, looking to learn from best
practices globally.

Our continued focus on high quality education has enabled our schools to achieve examination outcomes which
are generally well above the relevant national, regional or global averages for each curriculum despite the fact
that the majority of our schools are non-selective, for example:

- Over the past three years, our British curriculum schools in the United Kingdom and Spain consistently
achieved GCSE outcomes (in Math and English) significantly above the United Kingdom national average.

- Over the past five years, students at our IB curriculum schools achieved outcomes ahead of the “world
average” despite being non-selective schools, whilst the IB curriculum is, in many cases, offered by
selective schools.

- The Australian International School consistently achieves well on the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank
(“ATAR”) when compared to New South Wales. In 2017, the school had a mean ATAR score of 75.3
compared to a mean ATAR score of 70.0 for New South Wales. Additionally, 48% of AIS students gained
an ATAR score over 80 points.

- Over the past 10 years, our schools in Chile and Brazil have achieved PSU results (the standardized
university examination used in Chile) and ENEM results (the standardized university examination used in
Brazil) well above the respective national averages.

The high quality academics and student care delivered by our schools are also recognized by external school
inspections. As of August 31, 2018, every school inspected by the Independent School Inspectorate in the UK
was deemed fully compliant with regulations. In the period 2011-2017, inspections outcomes in the UK
improved significantly. In 2011, 20% of grades were outstanding, 76% good and 4% requiring improvement. In
2017, 87% of grades were outstanding and 13% good. Data following this date is not ranked in the same way as
current inspections are judging regulatory compliance. Every school inspection has been deemed fully compliant.

**_Resilient market and company performance through economic cycles_**

The private-pay K-12 education market has been resilient through the recent global economic downturn,
primarily due to the continuing demand from parents who view expenditure on their children’s education as
largely non-discretionary.

Benefiting from these market fundamentals, Cognita grew revenue consistently through and after the global
recession. Revenue increased in each in each year from £69 million in 2007 to £267 million in 2014, representing
a CAGR of 21%, with our pre-2007 portfolio (comprised of schools owned by us from the first day of the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2007 through the last day of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014) demonstrating
consistent organic annual growth with a CAGR of 5% over the period.

Our performance through downturns and negative macroeconomic events is further supported by a flexible
operating cost structure. A majority of our costs are variable and semi-variable (including staff costs) and can be
adjusted in the medium-term in the event of a downturn to preserve free cash flow and service debt. Teacher
salaries, the largest component of our cost base, typically grow in line with inflation but at a discount to fee
growth. In each of our markets our fees have grown at a premium to inflation during the last three fiscal years.

**_Significant requirements before a competitor can achieve our scale and experience_**

Our existing scale, financial resources, operational experience and deep institutional knowledge allows us to
better address certain structural hurdles in expanding in existing markets and entering new markets compared to
other operators. For instance, significant financial resources are required in order to invest in new school
facilities or to acquire existing schools. Our broad experience coupled with our strong understanding of the local
markets facilitates our ability to meet legal, financial and other requirements in securing government licenses and
regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions. Additionally, centralized expertise and local knowledge helps us
address the issue of the scarcity of real estate in key markets and the tendency of property developers and
landlords to prefer operators with a strong track record and financial resources. Our long and positive track
record and established reputation underpins our ability to recruit and retain high quality teachers, particularly in
expatriate markets. Finally, student retention driven by the preference of students to stay at the same school for
the tenure of their education is another important factor enhancing our leading position in this market as it
discourages existing students from switching to other schools.

**_Attractive financial profile with high revenue visibility and strong cash conversion/cash flow generation_**

Our business model offers exceptional near and medium-term visibility on revenues and cash flows as a result of
long admissions lead time, high retention, long average student tenure, consistent net positive churn and high
visibility on the competitive landscape. Tuition fees are prepaid and we have minimum notice periods for
students to withdraw without penalty, and we offer only limited refunds of tuition and other fees. The average
year-on-year Student Retention Rates for the last three fiscal years ended August 31, 2018, have been
approximately 74% in Asia, 85% in Europe and 90% in Latin America (84% average across our segments).
During the last three fiscal years, approximately 81% of our net tuition fee revenues were generated from
retained students. Additionally, we maintain good forward visibility on the revenue attributable to new joiners
through close monitoring of early confirmations and pipeline. Our revenue visibility enables us to make
operational adjustments, balance utilization, expand capacity and manage costs more effectively, which
facilitates an efficient use of resources.

Our revenue growth across all regions coupled with our disciplined approach to cost management has enabled us
to achieve consistent Regional Adjusted EBITDA growth from fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 to the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2018. Over this period, Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 14%. This was
achieved despite investment in regional resources to position the Group for future growth.

We had an operating cash conversion rate of 63.6% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (97.3% before
operating capital expenditure), which was driven by structurally negative working capital due to the advance
collection of tuition fees (and low levels of bad debt), which becomes increasingly favorable as enrollments
grow, and efficiently managed capital expenditure (operating capital expenditure has averaged 5.9% of Group
turnover for the three fiscal years ended August 31, 2018).

**_Strong Management Team_**

We have a highly experienced, dynamic and operationally focused management team, through the Group at both
the Group and regional level. Our management combines educational leadership with a proven track record
managing global development and expansions and integrating new acquisitions. Our senior management team
has significant experience in the education sector, and collectively, bring with them strong backgrounds in
management, marketing, human resources, real estate and finance. Our management team is supported by the
EAB in pursuing outstanding educational practices across the Group.

Our operating model is based on regionalization, whereby local school management teams, led by the Head
Teacher, focus on the provision of education and regionalized teams manage certain functions, such as human
resources, marketing and admissions, quality assurance, property and facilities management, IT systems and
some finance functions. Our central Group team is responsible for strategy, governance, finance, legal and IT and
general oversight of the Group. This allows the local school-based leadership teams, Head Teachers and
academic staff to focus on delivering academic excellence customized for the school and its catchment.

**Our Strategy**

We consistently focus on the following elements of our Group strategy to maintain our position as one of the
leading global operators of private-pay K-12 schools.

**_Continue to deliver high quality education to maintain and increase demand for our offering_**

Our aim is to become the best and most admired global schools group and to drive enrollments across our
portfolio by focusing on high quality educational outcomes and student and parent satisfaction. Academic rigor
and excellence are at the core of our value proposition to parents and students and influence all of our strategic
decisions. We intend to maintain our systematic and data-driven approach, using our global platform, systems
and experience to closely track student progress, develop individualized approaches to help students meet and
surpass expectations and ultimately obtain superior educational outcomes and improve the quality of the
provision of education in all of our schools. We continue to invest in our people who are integral to this mission
of delivering academic excellence and to develop processes that allow us to bring the benefits of our global scale
to the individual student.

We will also continue to develop a tailored educational offering, which appeals to the specific parent and student
demographic of each of our schools and focuses on personalized learning and will continue to implement
innovative approaches to education, including language development programs (such as daily Mandarin in our
Singapore schools), bilingual and English as second language curricula, unique educational experiences (such as
outdoor leadership programs and summer camps through our Active Learning Group (“ALG”) and direct
university partnerships offering college credits), high quality athletic programs and extensive co-curricular clubs
and activities.

**_Leveraging our global platform and reputation_**

We intend to continue to utilize our regionalized management approach to allow our regional and local school
management teams to focus on delivering educational excellence customized for their respective region and
school, while sharing academic and administrative best practices across all of our schools. At the same time, our
global scale provides operating leverage and economies of scale through consolidation of specialized functions
and know-how at the regional or Group level.

In addition, we intend to continue our strategy of attracting, retaining and investing in high-quality teaching
professionals by offering professional development opportunities and prospects of global mobility through our
network of schools. We will continue to support this through an active appraisal program and frequent
conversations with our teachers regarding career progression, skills, aspirations, delivery and impact. We believe
that maintaining our existing high levels of support staff, which allow our teachers to focus on the educational
needs of individual students, will enable us to maintain a high level of job satisfaction of our teachers and enable
us to recruit and retain “best-in-class” teachers.

**_Maximizing operating and financial performance_**

We continuously monitor and evaluate the operational performance of our schools and staff across our global
platform to identify opportunities for enhancement and to capitalize on embedded growth. An ongoing focus on
optimizing our marketing and admissions processes is a key feature of our strategy to increase student
enrollments and improve utilization of our platform. At the same time, we aim to place a strong emphasis on
student retention through processes designed to measure and understand churn at our schools and intervene to
ensure high levels of student and parent satisfaction.

We also seek to consistently generate fee growth above cost inflation, supported by the growing demand for
private-pay K-12 education in the markets in which we operate, our strong reputation and the quality of our
educational provision, in order to grow our revenue and increase our Adjusted EBITDA margins. We will
continue to place significant emphasis on optimizing resources to manage our costs efficiently, including
centralized or regional procurement of goods and services to benefit from economies of scale, improved
operating leverage and maintaining operational flexibility.

**_Continue to look for expansion and acquisition opportunities in existing and selected attractive and scalable_**
**_markets_**

Having successfully completed over 40 acquisitions since 2004, we are a natural consolidator and growth leader
in the sector. We added nearly 5,000 seats in premium markets over the past year. Our growth has been
thoughtful and has been driven by targeted development (through acquisitions, greenfields and expansions),
based on data and insights, which has complemented embedded growth stemming from our ability to drive
enrollments and fill available capacity at our existing schools. Our track-record of acquisitions, greenfield
projects and expansions has demonstrated our ability to create and fill new additional capacity. For example,
enrollments grew at the Stamford American International School in Singapore (our first greenfield development)
from approximately 109 students in fiscal year 2010 to approximately 2,900 students in fiscal year 2017.
Likewise, following our acquisition of the British School of Barcelona, enrollments grew by 84% during the
same period. Successfully implemented transactions such as these, where we preserve and enhance the quality of
the acquired school in addition to growing enrollment, have further demonstrated our ability to transact in many
markets and have made us a buyer-of-choice for family and trusts.

Our data driven approach has resulted in us developing a proprietary pipeline of opportunities curated over more
than 10 years. We intend to continue to evaluate both strategic expansion, acquisition and greenfield
opportunities to develop capacity in markets in which we have experience or which we have identified as
attractive based on rigorous analysis of the relevant market dynamics. We have identified a number of additional
capacity expansion opportunities in certain regions. For example, we are in the process of developing the ELIS
school in Murcia, Spain and we are embarking on the second phase of expansion at the Stamford American
school in Hong Kong. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to enter new regions such as the Middle
East and expanding into new markets in Asia and Latin America.

**History**

We commenced our operations through the acquisition of our frst school, Quinton House, in the United Kingdom
in 2004 followed by the acquisition of the Asquith Court Group which comprised of 17 schools in the United
Kingdom.

By the end of the 2008 fiscal year, we had expanded and diversified our operations to a total of 46 schools,
including the acquisition of four international curriculum schools, including Southbank International School in

103


-----

London and the Australian International School in Singapore. In addition, during this year we also embarked on
our first greenfield project to build the Stamford American International School in Singapore.

In October 2009, we expanded our portfolio into Thailand through the acquisition of an 80% interest in BEMS,
through which we operate three St. Andrews schools. In May 2011, we acquired an 80% interest in International
Education Corporation Joint Stock Company (Vietnam), which operates ISHCMC and AAVN and which is
controlled by a third-party nominee who has assigned his rights to us under a deed of assignment. In September
2011, we acquired the Royal School Hampstead in the United Kingdom which we later incorporated into the
North Bridge House group of schools.

In October 2012, we expanded into Latin America with the acquisition of Playpen in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in
June 2013 we acquired a majority interest in a Chilean school group consisting of nine schools in Santiago,
Colina, Valparaiso, Puerto Montt and Temuco (the “Chile Schools Business”).

In August 2013, our third-party nominee acquired the remaining 20% minority interest in International Education
Corporation Joint Stock Company (Vietnam), such that we effectively control 100% of our Vietnam schools
through the nominee structure.

We acquired a 75% interest in the International School Saigon Pearl in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in January
2014 and we acquired the remaining 25% interest in August 2014. In December 2014, we acquired the
GayLussac School in Niteroi, Brazil. In addition to the new acquisitions, in September 2014 we opened the North
Bridge House Senior School and Sixth Form—Canonbury in London, enhancing the offering provided by the
North Bridge House group of schools. In February 2015, we acquired the remaining 20% minority interest in
BEMS.

In 2016, we acquired three additional schools: the International School of Barcelona in Sitges, Spain, which was
merged into our British School of Barcelona, The English Montessori School in Madrid, Spain and Dusit, our
fourth school in Bangkok, Thailand. In addition to the new acquisitions, we also opened Chicauma, a new school
in Santiago, Chile, which teaches a Chilean national curriculum.

In 2017, we acquired the Avondale Grammar School in Singapore, which later merged into our Australian
International School. We also opened the Stamford American School, our first school in Hong Kong, and a new
Early Learning Village (for students up to 6 years old) which provides separately branded facilities for the
Australian International School and Stamford American International school in Singapore.

In May 2017, we acquired the Bushcraft Company, which provides outdoor adventure trips for students aged 7 to
18 into woodland environments for practical and teambuilding experiences. We subsequently merged the
Bushcraft business into our Super Camps business to form the Active Learning Group (“ALG”).

In 2018, we acquired the American British School in Santiago, our eleventh school in Chile, and Woodland
Pre-Schools in Hong Kong. On August 31, 2018 we acquired Santo Tomas adding a further school in Santiago,
Chile. Finally, on November 6, 2018, we acquired Colegio Europeo de Madrid (“CEM”) in Madrid, Spain.

In addition, we may acquire additional schools in the future which would impact our results of operations going
forward.

Between 2011 and 2012, we merged two of our schools with other existing schools and sold the freehold
properties left vacant following these mergers. Furthermore, we transferred Ffynone House School in April 2012
and Ferndale Preparatory School in April 2014 to parent groups. In 2016, we closed our Chilton Cantelo and
Cranbrook schools and in 2017, we sold Sackville school to another school operator.

**Our Operations**

We own and operate a diverse range of schools that include nursery, preparatory/junior schools (for K-6), senior
schools (for 7-12) and schools for juniors through to seniors (K-12). The majority of our schools are operated
under an individual brand name, with some schools operating a number of campuses under the same brand name.
We also operate a mix of local and international schools covering various curricula. As of August 31, 2018, we
operated 54 predominantly local curriculum schools and 17 predominantly international curriculum schools,
however, some of our schools offer dual curricula. Our students include local and expatriate students and tuition
fees are typically paid by local and expatriate parents and, to a lesser extent, by employers of expatriate parents.

We believe that our ability to deliver quality education is supported by operational excellence underpinned by
our global platform. Day to day operations in our schools are supervised by an academic leader of the school (the
“Head”) and a senior leadership team. Each local school management team oversees the provision of education
and is responsible for delivering education in line with our mission of providing an “Inspiring World of
Education.” In order to enable local school management teams to focus on educational quality, we have

104


-----

centralized certain core functions, such as property and facilities management, information technology systems
and finance functions. Each centralized team oversees these functions on a regional and/or global basis. This
centralized approach also enables us to deploy our resources and capital to achieve the best outcomes for our
business by making operational and investment decisions based on areas where we are mostly likely to derive
benefits and maximize our returns. See “—Centralized Functions.”

In addition to our schools, we also operate holiday activity camps for children and other extra-curricular and
outdoor activities through our ALG and Camp Asia divisions. We operate holiday activity camps in the United
Kingdom, and in various other locations. Our camps are primarily intended for children aged four to 15 and
include students from within our own schools as well as the wider community. We provide a range of sports and
other activities as well as supervision for children attending our camps during the summer holiday vacation
period. For the purposes of carrying out its activities, ALG uses both existing Cognita schools as well as other
schools’ sites. Following the acquisition of the Bushcraft Company in 2017, we also provide outdoor adventure
trips for students aged 7 to 18 into woodland environments for practical and teambuilding experiences through
our ALG division. In Singapore, we established Camp Asia in the summer of 2012 at Stamford American
International School and it has now grown to operate from both of our schools in Singapore and is the largest
camps provider in Singapore.

We use our holiday activity camps and outdoor adventure trips to attract prospective students to our schools.
Furthermore, the operation of these holiday activity camps on school premises during school vacation periods
enables us to optimize the use of our facilities. In addition to our camps, we operate exchange programs across
certain of our schools, strengthening our value proposition through academic, cultural and sports exchange
programs that are tailored to each school.

**Academic Design and Delivery**

We place a significant emphasis on delivering academic excellence and exceptional student outcomes. The
majority of our schools follow a non-selective admissions policy and our schools seek to support each student in
achieving outcomes to the best of his or her ability. The key elements that we focus on to promote a high level of
academic quality are:

**_Curricula Offerings_**

We offer a wide range of internationally recognized curricula to appeal to both local and expatriate populations
and to facilitate the entry into a broad range of international tertiary educational institutions. We offer more than
one curriculum in certain of our schools. We currently offer the following curricula:

- the British curriculum, which is based on the standardized national curriculum for England and which with
respect to our Spain segment is supplemented with the Spanish national curriculum;

- the International Baccalaureate (“IB”), incorporating the Primary Years Program, Middle Years Program
and culminating in the prestigious and rigorous internationally recognized diploma program;

- the American curriculum (American Education Reaches Out standard, Massachusetts state standards, New
York state standards and Texas state standards);

- the Australian national curriculum;

- the Brazilian curriculum and the Brazilian (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Brazilian national
curriculum; and

- the Chilean curriculum and the Chilean (bilingual) curriculum, which is based on the Chilean national
curriculum.

**_Academic Assessment_**

Our approach to academic achievement is based on monitoring measurable outcomes for each student over time.
We measure examination results by the examination grade achieved and we focus on the value added for each
student, through initiatives such as measuring the difference between a student’s actual grade and their predicted
grade based on progress achieved over the course of the academic year.

We use a number of innovative, nationally recognized and accredited testing systems (such as MAP, GL and
CEM Durham) for various age groups to establish a baseline for anticipated performance. This baseline is then
benchmarked against data from other schools with students in an equivalent grade and serves as a basis for
measuring value added progress. We apply similar methodologies across all of our schools globally.

105


-----

**_Academic Outcomes and Parental Satisfaction_**

Our academic approach is designed to deliver consistently high quality education to ensure strong student
outcomes. Strong academic performance contributes to improved parent satisfaction, student retention and builds
school reputation, which in turn supports continued enrollment and fee generation. In particular, we assess and
track multiple aspects of parent satisfaction, the results of which inform our decision-making process. For
example, we measure and track parent satisfaction with respect to teaching and learning, extra-curricular
activities, communication, services and amenities and management of the school. We use professionally designed
and administered surveys in order to gather comprehensive feedback from parents. This data is then used to guide
school improvements and to provide quantitative data to support school governance and allocation of resources.

Our continued focus on excellence has enabled our schools to achieve examination outcomes which are generally
well above the relevant national, regional or global averages for each curriculum, even though we operate
non-selective schools, for example:

- Over the past three years, our British curriculum schools in our Europe segment consistently achieved
GCSE (math and English) outcomes significantly above the United Kingdom national average. In 2018,
94% of all graded awarded at GCSE were G4+ compared to 69% nationally. The newly reformed
qualification introduced Grade 9 as even higher than the previous A*. In 2018, we had 10% of students
awarded at this level compared to 4% nationally.

- Over the past five years, students at our IB curriculum schools achieved outcomes ahead of the “world
points average” despite being non-selective schools (whilst the IB curriculum is, in many cases, offered by
selective schools). In 2018, Southbank International School, St. Andrews International School, ISHCMC
and Stamford American School had average points scores of 37.6, 34.7, 33.5 and 32.3, respectively,
compared to the world points average of 29.8.

- The Australian International School consistently achieves well on the ATAR when compared to New South
Wales. In 2017, the school had a mean ATAR score of 75.3 compared to a mean ATAR score of 70.0 for
New South Wales. Additionally, 46% of AIS students gained an ATAR score over 80 points.

- Over the past three years, our schools in Chile and Brazil have achieved PSU results (the standardized
university examination used in Chile) and ENEM results (the standardized university examination used in
Brazil) well above the respective national averages.

The following charts highlight our schools’ superior academic performance as compared to national and world
averages for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 with respect to the UK, Chile, Brazil and Australia and for the

**_Academic Oversight and School Inspections_**

We believe that the key to academic success for our students is the academic vision of our Head Teachers,
supported by the quality of our teachers. We have established a disciplined approach to raising educational and
academic standards in our schools, both through rigorous governance by an experienced educational team as well

106


-----

as through standardized performance management processes. We are also subject to mandatory school
inspections by external regulators and accredited bodies in certain regions. We devote considerable attention to
such school inspections, as favorable ratings enhance our school’s reputation and local demand and we have
generally been successful in improving the academic performance and regulatory ratings from the time we
acquire a new school.

We have a Group Director of Education who works collaboratively with the leadership in each of our regions. In
the United Kingdom, where we have the largest number of schools, we have four Assistant Directors of
Education who are responsible for the educational performance of our schools and for ensuring a culture of
teaching excellence and high quality of standards in our schools. The Assistant Directors of Education work
directly with the Group Director of Education, each of whom provides leadership and school governance support
to the Head Teachers. We also have an Education Adviser in Spain who is part of the European team and who is
responsible for overseeing educational performance in that market. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom and
Spain, a quality assurance officer leads the internal school review process and works with the Head Teachers to
continually raise school standards and a compliance officer provides support and guidance on compliance
matters. In Asia, we have a Director of Education who was previously the Deputy Superintendent at Stamford
American School. In Chile, education standards and quality assurance is overseen by a Director of Education and
a team of education coordinators, who, as a group, have extensive experience with respect to Chilean curriculum,
bilingual education and teaching English as a foreign language. In Brazil, our two schools are overseen by a
Director of Education.

To further support academic quality, we regularly assess the quality of teaching within the classroom according
to standardized performance management methods. We have put in place a performance management system,
which we use to conduct a comprehensive review of our teachers including appraisals every four to six months,
lesson observations every four to six months and external assessment processes to track student progress and
teacher impact.

In 2017, we launched the Education Advisory Board (“EAB”), whose mission is to utilize evidence to support
outstanding educational practice across all of our schools. The EAB is chaired by Sir Kevan Collins, who is
currently chief executive officer of the Education Endowment Foundation. Among the EAB’s objectives are to
accelerate improvement at our schools, build teacher capacity, help prioritize and share effective practices and
establish external academic partnerships.

**_Student Experience and Extra-curricular Activities_**

We strive to enhance overall student experience by providing an environment with high quality facilities and a
broad range of extra-curricular activities. Facilities at our individual schools vary depending on the type of
school and fee range. We offer state-of-the-art facilities in certain of our schools, such as Stamford American
International School, which has iLearn centers (an online learning system), media center, climbing wall, golf
facilities, swimming pools, theatre, tennis courts and athletics facilities. Some of our schools, such as Quinton
House, offer over 100 different activities each week, ranging from sports to creative and performing arts to
foreign languages and community services. Many of our schools also offer before and after school care, sport,
music and arts and challenge programs, such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award, which promotes personal
development through a range of community service initiatives and fitness activities.

We believe that our global platform differentiates our schools through offerings, such as inter-school sports and
musical events, as well as academic student exchange programs. For example, we operate an exchange program
that enables students from our schools in Chile and Brazil to study for short periods of time at our schools in the
United Kingdom. As part of this program visiting students are fully integrated in both classroom study and
boarding accommodation, which allows them to improve their command of the English language and experience
British culture.

Our schools also provide activities and services that seek to encourage greater parental involvement, with
teachers placing a strong emphasis on positive interactions with parents. For example, our schools in Spain offer
a “Saturday Family Club,” which provides a range of activities for parents and students together.

Furthermore, we use technology to enhance student learning and support pedagogical innovations. For example,
Stamford American International School provides tablets to every student in its primary grades and laptops for
every student in its secondary grades. In addition to being a powerful educational tool to deliver digital content
for unique learning methodologies, this program also enhances the overall quality of the student experience.

**Summary of Our Schools**

In the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 we operated 70 schools in 8 countries. For the fiscal year ended August
31, 2018, our top ten schools by EBITDA contribution generated 56% of our EBITDA. During the same period,
our two schools in Singapore generated 36% of our EBITDA globally and 49% of our EBITDA generated in
Asia.

**Recruitment of Teachers and Human Resources**
A large part of our ability to deliver high quality education is dependent on the caliber of our teachers. Given the
importance of academic results to our mission to create “An Inspiring World of Education”, recruiting and

110


-----

retaining high quality teachers and Heads is a priority for us. We believe that our global platform offers attractive
professional development and career opportunities for our staff. In addition, we believe that we offer appropriate
compensation packages, which are based on the local markets in which we operate. Depending on the local
market, such packages may include housing allowances and other benefits, such as healthcare and pensions. Our
teachers and other staff are appropriately trained and qualified for their relevant positions.

We invest substantial resources into the professional development of our teachers to continually enhance their
skills. Our teachers are required to comply with the relevant continuing education requirements in each local
market. For example, teachers in certain jurisdictions are required to complete on-going professional training
programs in the form of classroom based training and other development activities to help them to keep abreast
of curriculum changes. We offer a program to enable selected teachers to complete a post graduate certificate in
education as well as a master of education program in the United Kingdom, Spain and certain countries in Asia
for current and aspiring leaders. We also host professional development conferences for leaders, business
managers and admissions personnel regularly throughout the academic year.

We have developed our own policy for safer recruitment. This policy applies to the recruitment and selection of
all of our staff, including non-employees. The policy provides guidelines regarding background checks on
prospective teachers and other staff in their country of origin and any country in which they have lived or worked
for at least three months since the age of 16.

In the United Kingdom, we follow the U.K. Guidance from the Department for Education safer recruitment
guidelines, the Independent Schools Inspectorate Handbook for the Inspection of Schools (2014), which ensures
consistent and compliant recruitment in the United Kingdom education sector. In Asia, we apply the United
Kingdom standards and also conduct additional non-mandatory compliance procedures, such as background
checks on new teachers where possible. Additionally, in Asia, we use Control Risks, an external risk consultancy
firm, to perform international integrity and background checks on prospective Heads and candidates for key
executive roles where such persons have worked in two or more countries. In Latin America, we conduct
background checks on new teachers and are in the process of expanding these to overseas checks as part of our
own policy for safer recruitment.

**Investment Opportunities**

Historically, we have pursued a combination of acquisitions, capacity expansions, investments in existing
operations, and greenfield projects to deliver growth. When considering an investment opportunity, we employ
an analytical, research and data-driven strategy to carefully evaluate both the market and catchment dynamics in
connection with the proposed acquisition, expansion or greenfield project. Our investment strategy has allowed
us to build an extensive global operating platform, as demonstrated below.

**_Market Selection_**

We target markets that exhibit favorable characteristics using a number of specific criteria, including
(i) underlying demand dynamics that support sustainable growth, (ii) increasing economic activity, which drives
affordability among local parents and expatriates, (iii) a limited supply of alternative private school operators in
the local catchment and (iv) a favorable regulatory environment. We further evaluate shortlisted markets to
ensure that other considerations such as cost structure, macroeconomic conditions and related risks are reflected
in our risk-return analysis.

Once we have identified an attractive market, we undertake a detailed analysis of catchment dynamics to
evaluate market potential. Analysis of a catchment involves estimating affordability and concentration of the
customer base, which is an important factor in determining if there are a sufficient number of parents within
driving distance of a potential school who have the requisite income levels to support our desired pricing models.
In addition, we analyze competitors within the catchment and frequently conduct parent surveys to understand
the optimum market positioning and educational offering for the area. While the nature of the analysis varies
based upon the type of opportunity being evaluated, we apply our selection process rigorously across all
opportunities.

**_Capacity Expansion at Existing Schools_**

We consider schools for expansion only if there is strong underlying unmet demand, if our existing school has
high current utilization rates and the school has an established reputation in the catchment area. Investments in
expansions at existing schools often yield strong returns within a shorter period than greenfield developments or
new acquisitions since much of the necessary academic and central resources are already in place.

Expansions of capacity in our existing schools are only possible where we have land available to undertake an
expansion of the existing facility. Therefore, the potential for future expansions are often considered at the time

111


-----

of acquiring or developing a new school. When acquiring or building a school, we undertake a detailed and
rigorous assessment that includes market analysis to ascertain existing and projected supply and demand trends at
a catchment level and options to obtain land that is optimally located and allows flexibility for expansion over
time. The planning regulatory framework is also taken into consideration. The costs involved in expanding the
capacity of an existing school primarily relate to development costs.

We have continued to expand in Singapore to meet high demand. In 2017, we opened a dedicated Early Learning
Village in Singapore, focused on infant care and Pre-K education. This expansion of the existing facilities shared
by the Stamford American International School and the Australian International School includes state of the art
facilities and provides over 2,100 additional places (increasing existing combined capacity at the two schools to
over 8,600). We believe this is an attractive expansion opportunity where we can leverage our local market
knowledge and experience, development expertise and the reputation of our current Singapore schools, in a
market where the supply of private-pay education for expatriate families is limited by land constraints and the
need for regulatory approvals.

In January 2018, we opened a new secondary campus (grades 6-12) for the International School of Ho Chi Minh
City (“ISHCMC”) in Vietnam. This added 900 additional seats (bringing total capacity to 1,950) in one of our
most high growth markets at one of the most prestigious schools in Ho Chi Minh City, which had been capacity
constrained for some years (104% Utilization in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017).

Strong demand in our Latin America segment has also driven expansions in the region. In 2018, we completed
the expansion of the GayLussac school in Niteroi, Brazil. The project provided enhanced facilities and created
incremental capacity of approximately 260 students (bringing total capacity to 1,700).

In the United Kingdom, we recently opened a new site for our Southbank International School, the most reputed
IB school in London, which has increased capacity by approximately 280 students (to 1,090) and includes a new
pre-university program, new facilities for the music department and specialist teaching and tutorial rooms.

Finally, in Spain, in April 2018, we completed a new pre-university center for the British School of Barcelona
which operates from nursery to year 13 and offers the British and IB curriculum, further increasing capacity by
approximately 400 students (to 2,200).

**_Acquisition and Integration of Newly Acquired Schools_**

We have both Group and regional in-house acquisition teams that evaluate and execute strategic acquisitions and
integrate acquired schools. Our acquisition teams work with the regional management teams who bring a deep
understanding of their local market and provide insight into cultural or regional variations.

During the closing stages of an acquisition, we set up an integration team to begin the process of early
engagement with the target school across all key functions. The level of engagement and timelines in connection
with integration activity vary according to the size and complexity of the acquired schools. Our integration
processes are structured to minimize operational disruptions at the acquired school.

Upon acquiring a new school, we implement our operational and strategic programs to improve educational
outcomes, student and parent satisfaction and operational and financial efficiency. For example, certain
management responsibilities with respect to IT, finance, facilities management and real estate may be transferred
to our regional and group teams, while the Heads and their senior management team will continue to retain
responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the school.

Following an acquisition of a new school, we seek to maximize student retention during the integration process
as well as desired retention of the Head Teacher and teachers. A key part of the integration process involves
acquiring an in-depth understanding of parental preferences and current levels of parent satisfaction. We also
engage in new marketing activities aimed at increasing student enrollment and parental satisfaction. As part of
our integration process, we also review existing teaching practices and implement any required changes to drive
academic excellence and we may recruit new teachers and train existing teachers to ensure a high quality of
teachers and support staff. We also seek to improve teacher and class utilization levels to optimize our
operational and financial performance.

**_Greenfield Projects_**

From time to time, we may participate in tender processes operated by governments, regulators or residential
developers to build new schools. Such tender processes are customary in certain countries in Asia to meet the
increasing demand for education. As part of our strategy to optimize our operations by participating in markets
which meet our selection criteria, we evaluate these greenfield investments on an opportunistic basis. If
successful, we would be required to develop and operate such new schools within a specified timeframe.

112


-----

Greenfield investments may be an attractive option to enter a market where there is very substantial unmet
demand and likely future demand growth.

To date, we have completed two greenfield projects. In 2009, we opened the Stamford American International
School in Singapore, which was initially built as a foundation campus on a temporary site. The school
subsequently moved to a “state-of-the-art” campus in 2012, which currently has a capacity of 3,300 students,
excluding the Early Learning Village. The number of FTE students enrolled at Stamford American International
School increased by 230 FTE students or 8.8% to 2,846 FTE students as of August 31, 2018 from 2,616 FTE
students as of August 31, 2016.

In September 2017, we opened the Stamford American School located in Kowloon, Hong Kong with 350 FTE
students in its first full academic year and which has capacity for over 800 FTE students (not including a planned
annex, which would bring total capacity up to 1,100 FTE students). The school began its second year with an
enrollment of approximately 600 students and has demonstrated strong re-enrollment rates reflecting the quality
of education.

In addition, in December 2014 we entered into an agreement with a real estate developer in Chile for the
construction of a school in Lampa, a suburb located to the northwest of Santiago. The school opened in February
2016 as Colegio Pamahue Chicauma. As of August 31, 2018, it had capacity for 474 students and an enrollment
of 360 students. We are required to purchase the school and pay for the construction costs only when we achieve
enrollment of 650 students. If we have not reached enrollment of 650 students by December 2025, we have the
option to terminate this agreement without any further obligations to operate or purchase the school or to pay the
construction costs. If we reach enrollment of 650 students at any time prior to December 2025, we will be
required to pay the developer the purchase price of the school and construction costs in an amount representing a
fixed sum for the land plus a variable component for the construction, the aggregate of which we currently
estimate to be approximately of £9.9 million.

**Student Recruitment**

To facilitate effective student recruitment and retention, each school has a team of marketing and admissions
professionals who are responsible for implementing activities to stimulate inquiries and to maximize conversions
of inquiries into enrollments. We place strong emphasis on admissions management and each school follows a
structured admissions process which reflects our best practices framework. Within this framework, particular
emphasis is placed on standardized and comprehensive customer data gathering and proactive inquiry
management through customer relationship management systems, including Salesforce in Singapore, interaction
with school academic staff and a personalized service, in order to create a positive experience for each individual
family.

While our student recruitment process consists of several stages, the key metrics in relation to our admissions
processes are the number of inquiries received by the school and the conversion of these inquiries into
enrollments. We have tools to monitor admissions KPIs. Through these tools, we monitor and analyze the source
of inquiries, demand for places and conversion of inquiries into enrollments by enrollment year and grade,
current and expected enrollments versus available capacity, current admissions pipeline and the status of each
inquiry. Schools maintain their own database to record relevant information about prospective parents, which
allows the school’s team to manage and progress each inquiry as well as provide management reporting.

- _Inquiries/Applications: parents considering enrolling their child at one of our schools register their child’s_
details and request further information from the relevant school. Once the information is received, parents
will likely visit the school for a tour or admissions event and then will choose whether to apply for a place at
the school by completing an application form and paying an application fee.

- _Admissions/Enrollments: if offered a place at one of our schools, parents are required to confirm the_
acceptance of the place by signing a contract. For certain segments, we charge a one-off facility fee or
upfront tuition fee for the first semester at the time of enrollment.

**_Generating Inquiries_**

Our marketing strategy is designed to develop awareness among prospective parents and students and loyalty and
advocacy among existing parents and students. While we standardize best practice across all of our schools, our
local personnel retain the flexibility to vary marketing tactics according to local requirements.

The majority of our inquiries are generated through the following methods:

_Website and Digital Marketing_

We recognize that online marketing is a critical means of communication with prospective parents and students,
as well as families of our existing students. Each school has its own website which is designed to serve both

113


-----

current and prospective parents, with information organized separately for each group. For prospective parents,
our websites are designed to convey our mission of providing an “Inspiring World of Education,” in a userfriendly manner to inform decision making and to enable ease of navigation through the use of online application
forms. We also use video content to highlight the school experience.

In addition to developing attractive, well-structured school websites that support our marketing and admissions
process, we utilize online advertising campaigns, effective search engine optimization and integration with social
media to enhance our communications with parents. We regularly monitor our websites and online inquiry
generation programs to enable adjustments to be made to campaigns and websites in order to optimize
responsiveness. Our digital efforts are supported by digital marketing agencies, whose expertise further
complements that of our internal staff.

_Parent Referrals_

We understand that some prospective parents may seek out parents of current and former students to solicit their
opinions on our schools. We encourage the parents of current and former students to speak positively about our
schools, and we believe we achieve this by providing high quality education, communicating with and involving
parents in our schools and seeking to place each of our schools at the center of its community through initiatives
including:

- **_Inclusive Events for Parents. Each school holds regular events, which parents are encouraged to attend and_**
at which they are able to interact with other parents. For example, some of our schools provide weekend
family days for students and their parents, parent engagement groups, which brings small groups of parents
together to provide feedback to the school and to discuss ideas for further development, and parent coffee
mornings, which offer a relaxed environment for parents to meet informally with staff of the school and to
socialize with each other.

- **_Community Relationship Building. Each school strives to develop strong relationships with local_**
organizations in the catchment. Partner organizations can include play groups, nurseries, and junior schools
that serve as feeder institutions to our schools, and sports leisure and social clubs for families that match the
profile of the schools’ parent body.

- **_Charitable Activities. All our schools participate in philanthropic initiatives that raise funds for local and_**
national charities. Many school fundraising activities include parents, staff and students.

_Relocation Agents_

In expatriate markets, relocation agents are an important source of inquiries. We develop close relationships with
these relocation agents through a variety of initiatives, such as hosting school visits, providing quality
information on our schools and producing user-friendly materials they can share with their clients.

_Employers_

Within our expatriate markets, we have established relationships with certain major employers, including multinational corporations and embassies. We understand that parents consult their employers for school
recommendations and information and we invite key personnel from leading corporations to participate in
community events that we organize in order to foster good relationships with these employers and to showcase
our schools.

_Other Marketing Activities_

We support our marketing program with targeted communications, including:

- **_Promotional Materials. We use promotional materials such as school brochures, educational magazines and_**
other publications to enhance our schools’ reputation as high quality and leading academic institutions.

- **_Public Relations. We create and distribute positive news stories, including news about our academic results_**
and quality of our school facilities to promote our schools’ profiles in the media.

**_Converting Inquiries into Enrollments_**

Typically, parents draw up a shortlist of schools for their child, review the schools’ website, request brochures
and then, to the extent possible, visit the school campuses. Based on our experience, parents generally visit two
or three schools before selecting the schools to which they will apply. As a result, our management of school
visits is important to convert inquiries into enrollments, and we have designed our systems to help maximize the

114


-----

conversion of inquiries into enrollments. For example, as part of our typical school visits, we provide an
opportunity for prospective parents and students to interact with the teachers who will educate the child, as in our
experience, a parent’s perception of a school’s academic quality is a key factor in school selection. We also seek
to ensure that promotional materials are provided to prospective parents and that such materials provide
appropriate information to convey each school’s academic credentials, such as standardized tests, examination
outcomes, scholarships achieved and university admissions.

Within each school, a dedicated admissions officer is responsible for handling parent inquiries, which includes
coordinating the school visit, ensuring that appropriate information is provided to the prospective parent and
maintaining close contact with the family throughout the entire process. Admissions officers work closely with
our Heads and teachers to ensure that individual school tours are tailored to the needs of the family and that the
most relevant teachers are available to meet with the families during their visit. In order to enhance our
conversion rates, our admissions officers participate in regional training programs which provide them with the
necessary skills to maximize their effectiveness.

**_Maximizing Student Retention_**

We are focused on retaining our students and we take a systematic approach to retention, including by
monitoring the average number of FTE students for any given year in a particular Cohort and generating churn
reports to understand student departures at a granular level. The most important aspect in maximizing student
retention is to ensure that the school understands and meets the developing needs of both its students and its
parents, and that any issues or concerns that may arise are addressed promptly. Our schools employ a number of
methods to encourage parent feedback, which include regular parent engagement groups and parent surveys. In
addition, we ensure that our teachers are accessible to parents. We use the data obtained through these processes
to develop proactive retention strategies and we seek to take prompt corrective action with respect to any
weaknesses identified in a particular school. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the percentage of
students retained within our schools was 85.2% of the total number of students.

**Centralized Functions**

In order to optimize our global operations, we have centralized certain core functions relating to finance,
facilities, IT, human resources and marketing on a regional and/or global basis. By centralizing these functions,
we are able to provide more professional management and expertise in these areas and utilize tailored systems
across the Group. In addition, by minimizing these functions at each individual school, we enable local school
management to focus solely on educational quality and the day-to-day operations of our schools.

Our centralized functions include:

- **_Education. Each region has a Director of Education. Because of the number of schools in Europe, there are_**
also four Assistant Directors of Education. There is a Group Director of Education who leads the work of
the regional teams, linked to identified group priorities. Group systems that support the Education function
include the learning management system, Cornerstone.

- **_Information Technology Systems. We determine our IT systems needs by considering both global and local_**
requirements, implementing where appropriate, Group or region-wide solutions that ensure consistency and
cost effectiveness in the IT procurement process. Additionally, local school management systems (such as
SIMs in the UK and PowerSchool for U.S. curriculum schools) are implemented to address specific local
market needs, ensuring that schools retain flexibility to address local or regional needs whilst leveraging
Group procurement wherever appropriate. Regional IT teams are overseen by the Group CIO who reports to
the Group CFO.

- **_Finance. Each school has a finance team that reports to country or regional finance, who in turn report_**
through to the Group finance team led by the Group CFO. Our finance teams are responsible for accounting
and reporting, risk management, compliance, business planning, forecasting, preparation of budgets,
management information, financial policy and procedures, treasury activities and allocation of financial
resources. Group systems that support the Finance function include NetSuite, which has been implemented
in all of our schools globally.

- **_Real Estate. Our regional real estate management teams have strategic and day-to-day oversight of all_**
aspects of our real estate portfolio, including estate management, maintenance, facilities management,
expansion or development projects and are also responsible for the real estate planning and execution
relating to major developments or potential acquisitions. Our real estate team is also responsible for the
procurement of certain goods and services, and ensuring compliance with legal, health and safety guidance.

115


-----

- **_Human Resources. Each region has a director of HR and a team responsible for overseeing our staff related_**
activities including recruitment, performance management, compensation and benefits, talent management
and the related policy and compliance routines. Group systems that support the HR function include
Cornerstone.

- **_Marketing and Admissions. Regional marketing and admissions directors support strategy development for_**
each region, provide centralized marketing support for key channels such as digital marketing and provide
management oversight of school marketing and admissions personnel in their day-to-day activities.

- **_Safeguarding. The Chief Executive has strategic and operational responsibility for safeguarding._**
Operational accountability is delegated to the Regional CEO’s. Our Group Head of Safeguarding
Governance, who ultimately reports to the CEO, oversees safeguarding standards for the Group and we
undergo an annual review process in respect of each of our schools, following which recommendations
are implemented at the regional level by Regional Safeguarding Advisors that provide support and guidance
to the schools.

**Accreditation**

We require a license or permit from the relevant regulatory authority to operate each of our schools. In addition,
in certain jurisdictions we also require licenses to offer curricula from certain accrediting organizations. Our
teachers are also subject to the relevant regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction in which we operate. In
addition, our schools are required to comply with industry operating standards and may be subject to inspection
by the relevant accreditation body. Such inspections generally relate to educational requirements and to health
and safety standards. We have the requisite licenses and permits to operate. See “Regulation.”

**Employees**

For the Fiscal Year ended August 31, 2018, we had an average of 5,858 FTE employees consisting of:

Our teachers and other staff in Brazil, Chile, Spain and Vietnam are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
In Chile we have had strikes or threats of strikes in relation to the Penalolen union. In addition, in Brazil, there
was a one-day teacher strike in 2018, which came amid a wave of strikes in other industries in the country. We
otherwise do not believe we face the threats of strikes or other action from our teachers in those countries that
could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of
operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors— Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for
_our teachers and staff and other employee relation issues may adversely affect our financial results.”_

**Intellectual Property**

We are the applicant or registrant of trademarks relating primarily to our logos, names of our individual schools
and “Cognita” which is registered in the EU, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Chile, Mexico, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and pending registration in Hong Kong.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance cover in respect of various insurable risks under a range of insurance policies. These
include property, fire and consequential loss, business interruption, public liability, professional indemnity and
personal injury. Assets are covered on a replacement cost basis. We also have insurance cover for our teachers
and staff such as life insurance and travel insurance.

**Properties**

Our Group headquarters are located in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom where we lease approximately
10,700 square feet. As of August 31, 2018, we had 36 freehold and 90 leasehold school properties (including
playing fields, car parks and administrative buildings). The average remaining tenure with respect to our

116


-----

leasehold school properties is 23 years. Approximately 30% of the Group’s leases are due to expire over the next
five years. Of these, two properties pose a risk of not being renewed in the future and management are in the
process of securing arrangements to ensure suitable properties for these schools’ operations.

**Litigation**

We may be subject to legal or administrative proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary course of our business.
Other than as described below, we are not currently subject to any such claims that we believe could reasonably
be expected to have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial
condition.

A former teacher at the Southbank International School was engaged in criminal conduct with respect to a
number of students during the course of his career, including between 2009 and 2013, during which time he
taught at Southbank International School. Investigations associated with the case have now ended. Our insurers
have agreed to cover current and future claims. To date, only a small number of claims have been made, though
we may face further civil claims by such persons or by other affected students or their parents. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Further developments relating to the widely reported inappropriate_
_conduct by a former teacher at the Southbank International School could result in damage to our reputation, a_
_decrease in enrollments, civil liabilities and regulatory or other legal action, all of which could have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.”_

**REGULATION**

Our schools are subject to regulation by national and local authorities under applicable law. Compliance is built
into the regular routines operated by our schools. Our schools are inspected regularly by the relevant
accreditation body. Below is a summary of the principle regulatory framework in each of the countries we
operate in.

**Europe**

**_England and Wales_**

Section 463 of the Education Act 1996 (as amended) defines an independent school in England and Wales as any
school at which full time education is provided for five or more students of compulsory school age (i.e., five to
16 years old), or one or more such students with an Education Health and Care Plan or a statement of special
educational needs or who is “looked after” by a local authority, and is not a school maintained by U.K. local
authority or a non-maintained special school. In England, such independent school must register with the
Secretary of State for Education (the “SSE”), that is responsible for the work of the Department for Education
(the “DfE”). In Wales, an independent school must register with the Welsh Ministers (“WM”), who form part of
the Welsh Government. Independent schools must be registered before they start to operate and failure to do so is
an offence punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment. Establishments that cater to children under the age of five
are required to register as an independent school if they meet the definition of an independent school. If an
establishment caters for children solely under the age of five, in England they must register with the Ofsted Early
Years Directorate and in Wales with the Wales Care & Social Services Inspectorate (“CSSIW”). Establishments
offering education solely for 16 to 19 year olds do not need to register as independent schools.

The SSE and the WM must be satisfied that the Independent School Standards are likely to be met before a
school can be registered. These standards are set out in the Education (Independent School Standards)
Regulations 2014 and the Independent School Standards (Wales) Regulations 2003, respectively (collectively the
“Regulations”). Once a complete application is made in England, the SSE will ask the Office for Standards in
Education, Children’s Services and Skills (“Ofsted”) (which oversees various aspects of state and independent
schools in England) to inspect the school and provide a report as to whether the school is likely to meet these
standards upon registration. The SSE will consider the report from Ofsted and any other evidence available in
coming to a decision. The process in Wales is similar with Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education and
Training in Wales (“Estyn”) (which oversees various aspects of state and independent schools in Wales)
providing the report to WM. If the school is a boarding school it will also be inspected by CSSIW. The
application process generally takes around six months from receipt of a complete application. If the registration
is not granted within the timescales proposed it will not be deemed to have been granted. Pupils must not be
admitted to the school until such school has received confirmation that it has been included in the Register of
Independent Schools.

The Regulations require the SSE or the WM to make checks on any individual responsible for the day to day
management of an independent school. The individual must not be barred under section 3(2) of the Safeguarding
Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and checks must be undertaken in respect of the person’s identity and right to work
in the United Kingdom. An enhanced criminal record check must also be undertaken. In England, this record
check must be countersigned by the SSE and in Wales, by a Welsh Government official. If the proprietor has
lived overseas, checks must also be made with the relevant overseas authorities and/or such other checks as the
SSE or WM, as applicable, directs. If the proprietor is a formally constituted board of governors, directors or
trustees, a trust or a limited company, only the chair will be required to undergo such checks. When inspected, a
school will be required to provide evidence that these checks have been carried out and recorded on a ‘single
central register. Proprietors must ensure that staff also meet all the above requirements and, in addition, if staff
care for, train or are in charge of boarders, the National Minimum Standards for boarding schools must be met or
for boarding schools which cater wholly or mainly for pupils with special educational needs, the National
Minimum Standards for Residential Special Schools must be met.

The DfE guidance states that all new independent schools are required to have an Ofsted inspection in their first
year of operation, and provided that all Independent School Standards are met, schools will be inspected on a
regular basis thereafter. Schools that belong to an Independent Schools Association, such as our schools in
England, will have inspections carried out by an independent inspectorate rather than Ofsted. The Welsh
Government guidance states that Estyn will carry out an inspection between three and six months after the date
the school is registered (and, if it is a boarding school, will also be inspected again by CCSIW), and at least every
six years thereafter to judge compliance with the Independent School Standards. Independent schools can be
inspected at any time and inspections will be more frequent where there is a cause for concern. If there is
evidence that a school is failing to meet the required Independent School Standards, and the SSE or the WM, as

122


-----

applicable, considers that there is a risk of serious harm to the welfare of the students, the school can be removed
from the Register of Independent Schools, subject to appeal. In all other circumstances where the results of an
inspection or other evidence reveals that the school does not meet one or more of the standards, the standards that
are not being met will be identified and the SSE or the WM, as applicable, will require the proprietor to submit
an action plan on how the issue will be remedied within a specified period of time. If the plan is rejected, or the
issue is not remedied in line with an agreed action plan, then the SSE or the WM, as applicable, can remove the
independent school from the register (after the conclusion of an appeal), require the proprietor to cease using any
part of the school’s premises, close any part of the school’s operation or order the school to cease to admit new
students or students of a certain description. Decisions made by the SSE or the WM, as applicable, are subject to
appeal within 28 days.

All independent schools must gain approval from the SSE or the WM, as applicable, before making material
changes, including, for example, a change of proprietor or a change to admit, or cease to admit, children with
special educational needs. Whilst the majority of changes will be approved quickly, some can take up to six
months, and if approval is not forthcoming within six months, it will not be deemed to have been granted. Where
a material change is made without seeking approval, the SSE or the WM, as applicable, may remove the school
from the register of independent school.

Education providers in England and Wales are prohibited under the Equality Act 2010 from discriminating in
relation to admissions, exclusions, provision of education and access to any benefit, facility or service on the
grounds of any of the relevant “protected characteristics.” Such protected characteristics are disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Schools in England
and Wales must also comply with a range of other legislation that includes, among others, child welfare and
protection, health and safety, data protection and food safety. Schools are required to have relevant policies in
place that address such issues.

**_Spain_**

Spanish privately-owned foreign schools are mainly regulated under the Royal Decree 806/1993, May 28 (the
“Spanish Royal Decree 806/1993”), which specifically regulates the regime applicable to foreign schools in
Spain, and more generally by the Organic Law 8/1985, July 3, which regulates the right to education; the Organic
Law 2/2006, May 3, which regulates education; and the Royal Decree 332/1992, April 3, which regulates
authorizations of private schools to teach under the non-university education general regime (the “Spanish Royal
_Decree 332/1992”). Under the scope of the Spanish Constitution, all these regulations are guided by the general_
principle of freedom to found public or private educational establishments (article 27.6).

Pursuant to the Spanish Royal Decree 806/1993 and the Organic Law 8/1985, all natural or legal persons can be a
holder of a privately-owned foreign school in Spain, regardless of their nationality, with the exception of:

- persons that already provide services to the Spanish national, regional (Autonomous Community) or local
education administrations;

- persons who have any criminal record for intentional crimes; and

- persons expressly deprived of this right by judgment.

For legal persons, the above mentioned restrictions will apply when the person affected by the restriction holds a
governing position or 20% or more of the issued share capital.

In order to operate in Spain, schools must obtain authorization from the Spanish Ministry of Education.

The Spanish Royal Decree 332/1992 governs the general administrative procedure for the granting of
authorizations of private schools to teach under the non-university education general regime. According to this
regulation, the authorizations to operate privately-owned foreign schools in Spain will be granted provided the
applying education centers meet the minimum administrative requirements. Where such centers do not meet or,
subsequently fall below, the minimum requirements, the authorizations shall not be awarded or may subsequently
be revoked.

Once granted, as a general rule the authorization does not need to be renewed and the schools are registered with
the Public Registry of Schools and subject to inspection. In order to obtain the required authorization to operate
in Spain, foreign privately-owned schools must satisfy: (i) both basic requirements applicable to all Spanish
schools (such as adequate hygiene, safety, acoustic, and habitability conditions at the school premises, and
architectural characteristics to guarantee the mobility of disabled students); as well as (ii) the relevant
requirements of the applicable education authorities for the specific curricula taught in every school.

123


-----

Where modifications to the education centers and/or authorized teaching programmes (amongst others, as
foreseen in article 13 of Spanish Royal Decree 332/1992) are implemented, such modifications would require
additional administrative approval.

Foreign educational curricula is required to include certain Spanish-specific contents. In the case of international
schools that do not follow the Spanish curricula, schools are required to seek an international accreditation and
ratification from the relevant foreign embassy, a copy of which is provided to the Ministry of Education before
the local Spanish authorization is granted.

All of our schools in Spain are accredited by the National Association of British Schools in Spain and have been
accredited and ratified by the British Council. Schools in Spain must comply with a range of legislation and other
directives that include child welfare and protection, criminal records checks, health and safety, data protection,
racial equality, disability discrimination, food allergy and school trips.

**Asia**

**_Singapore_**

The primary regulator for private education providers in Singapore, is the Committee for Private Education (the
“CPE”), which was appointed by SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (“SSG”) to carry out SSG’s functions and
powers under the Private Education Act (Cap. 247A) of Singapore (“PE Act”). Asides from being tasked with
regulating the private education sector, the CPE also provides student services, consumer education and
facilitates capability development efforts to uplift standards in the local private education industry. Notably, a
private education institution must be deemed suitable for the delivery of private education by relevant land
planning and fire safety authorities, therefore a private education institution must seek the CPE’s permission
before operating in and making any changes to its premises. The managers of the private education institution,
which in relation to a corporate body means any director, partner or member of its board or committee of
management, or other similar officer of the corporate body, and includes any person in accordance with whose
directions, instructions or wishes such directors, partners or other members (as the case may be) are accustomed
or under an obligation to, to abide (whether formally or informally), must also meet the fit and proper criteria
based on the guidelines issued by the CPE.

Under Section 34 of the PE Act, no person in Singapore may offer to provide or provide private education, or
award any degree, diploma or certificate (including any honorary degree or other distinctions) in respect of
private education, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, unless the person is registered as a private education
institution. The registration periods granted by the CPE are 2 years, 4 years or 6 years and the registration of a
private education institution is subject to renewal. Every renewed period of registration will be determined by the
CPE based on a set of criteria. Application for renewal of such registration should be submitted to the CPE at
least 3 months prior to the date of expiry of the existing term of registration. In this respect, the Australian
International School has been granted a four year registration from 6 July 2015 to 5 July 2019. The Stamford
American International School has been granted a four year registration from 10 August 2018 to 9 August 2022.

The Private Education Regulations 2009 also provides, inter alia, that every private education institution shall
establish an academic board and an examination board. In addition, every registered private education institution
is required to prepare and submit an annual report of its activities and affairs to the CPE by 31st December (or by
any other stipulated date as advised by the CPE) of every year.

In addition to being registered with the CPE, the Australian International School and the Stamford American
International School have also been awarded the EduTrust Award under the EduTrust Certification scheme,
which is a voluntary quality assurance scheme that helps to distinguish higher quality educational institutions in
Singapore’s private education industry. There are three EduTrust certification awards under the EduTrust
Certification Scheme. In particular, the EduTrust award (which was given to the Australian International School
and the Stamford American International School) is awarded to private education institutions for sustaining an
excellent level of performance in managing their institutions and providing high quality education standards and
welfare for their students. The EduTrust certification has a validity of up to four years. Certification is done
through an assessment of how well the private education institution’s systems and processes address and align
with the seven criteria required under the EduTrust framework and produce the desired outcomes through
effective implementation. The seven criteria are: (i) management commitment and responsibilities, (ii) corporate
governance and administration, (iii) management of external recruitment agents, (iv) student protection and
support services, (v) academic processes and assessment of students, (vi) the achievement of student and
graduate outcomes, and (vii) quality assurance, monitoring and results.

Singapore citizens who reside in Singapore are required to attend national schools and are not permitted to attend
foreign system schools or private education institutions unless approval has been granted by the Ministry of

124


-----

Education. Such applications are assessed and granted on a case-by-case basis by the Ministry of Education and
may be subject to terms and conditions.

In respect of the fee collection restrictions, save for the exception of imposing charges for late payment of course
fees, a private education institution is not allowed to collect deposits or penalties from any student for any
purpose regardless of whether such deposit or penalty is refundable or not. In addition, a registered private
education institution that is not specified in the Third Schedule of the Private Education Regulations 2009 of
Singapore is required to comply with the statutorily prescribed fee collection schedule for courses that last more
than two months.

**_Thailand_**

The key regulations in regards to education in Thailand are the National Education Act and the Private Schools
Act. The National Education Act outlines the fundamental rights and duties regarding the education of Thai
people and provides for the establishment of the Office of the National Education Standards and Quality
Assessment (“NESQA”). The NESQA is a public organization that ensures that education is properly provided
and assesses whether the provision of education complies with the national education policy and serves the needs
of the people. The Private Schools Act regulates the private school business in Thailand. It establishes the Office
of the Private Education Commission (“OPEC”), which, under the supervision of the Office of the Permanent
Secretary for Education, provides general oversight for K-12 education in Thailand and promotes and supports
private education data and registration, as well as monitors and evaluates the provision of private education.

The Private Schools Act requires that, in order to establish a private school (formally or informally), a license
must first be obtained from the Secretary-General of OPEC located in Bangkok, so long as the private school is
to be located in Bangkok. If the private school is to be located outside Bangkok, the license must be applied for at
the Provincial Primary Educational Service Area Office located in the respective province where such school is
located unless the District Office of Private Education is established in such province. The application for a
private school license must include evidence demonstrating that upon being granted a license, a school will have
ownership or a possessory right of land for a period of no less than 10 years. The license holder can be either an
individual or a corporate entity possessing qualifications as established in the Private Schools Act and the
notification promulgated thereunder. In the event that there is an individual license holder, such individual must
be of Thai nationality. In cases where the license holder is a corporate entity, no less than half of the total number
of shares of such entity is required to be held by Thai persons (individual or entity) and no less than half of the
total number of shareholders is required to be of Thai nationality (individual or entity). Our license is owned by
an entity which is owned by a Thai person for purposes of these rules, but that person has assigned all of his
ownership rights to us, which we believe is not unusual in various sectors which have foreign ownership
restrictions in Thailand. While such nominee structures in the international school education sector have not been
challenged by regulators, the position is uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are
_subject to rules arising from our ownership structures in Thailand and Vietnam.” Private school licenses are_
transferable provided that certain statutory requirements are met.

The school entity is a separate entity from the license holder for the school, and the license holder shall act as
representative of such school entity. The school charter forms the relationship between the license holder and the
school. The school is governed under the school charter and operated by the executive board consisting of the
license holder, the manager of the school, the director of the school, teacher representatives, representatives of
the students’ parents, and other qualified members (the “Executive Board”). Changes to the school charter and
details relating to the school’s business, including operating plan or tuition fees, after obtaining a private school
license, shall require prior approval from the Executive Board and the corresponding authority.

In order to maintain the required authorization from the Ministry of Education, schools are required to comply
with the Private Schools Act and other rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Schools in Thailand must
also comply with a range of applicable legislation and other directives that include without limitation legislation
and directives related to child welfare and protection, health and safety, data protection, racial equality, and
disability and religion discrimination.

Tuition fees and other fees are fixed by the Executive Board and shall be publicly announced within the school
area. If the Ministry of Education or OPEC determines that the school charges tuition fees that create an
excessive burden on the public or seeks exorbitant profits and the school fails to justify such exorbitant profits,
the Ministry of Education or OPEC has the power to order the reduction of tuition fees as they deem appropriate.

**_Vietnam_**

In Vietnam, the primary regulatory authorities are the Ministry of Education and Training and the Department of
Education and Training. The Ministry of Education and Training is the primary governmental authority for

125


-----

education in Vietnam while the Department of Education and Training is the organization responsible for issuing
the “Education Operation Decision” that allow schools to operate in Vietnam. Foreign operators are also required
to register and obtain a requisite approval from the Department of Planning and Investment with respect to its
investment or acquisition of any existing enterprise owning and operating schools in Vietnam. Where a new
enterprise is to be incorporated to implement an investment project in the education sector, the foreign investors
are required to first obtain an Investment Registration Certificate and an Enterprise Registration Certificate for
such project from the Department of Planning and Investment.

Vietnam laws allow up to 100% foreign ownership of an educational establishment; however, foreign operators
must meet minimum requirements in terms of, amongst other things, investment per capita, student intake and
teaching staff in order to obtain an “Education Operation Decision.”

Also, subsequent to the passage of a new decree in 2018, Vietnamese students are entitled to study foreign
curriculum at general education schools (including at the primary, secondary and high school level) and also at
kindergartens/pre-schools although the enrollment rate of Vietnamese students at such schools is limited. In
particular, pursuant to this decree, the number of Vietnamese students studying foreign curriculum in foreigninvested schools must be less than 50% of the total number of students studying foreign curriculum at such
school. Such enrollment rate under the new decree however is much more favourable than the rate under the
former decree, and appears to evidence a push towards encouraging foreign investment in the education sector in
Vietnam.

Under the new decree, foreign-invested schools which received permission for establishment or for their
educational operations prior to the effective date of such decree, are not required to apply for recommencement
of operations. Further, the investment law of Vietnam also offers a principle that, where a new legal instrument
which is introduced provides lower investment incentives than those which the investor has previously enjoyed,
the investor shall continue to be entitled to the investment incentives in accordance with the previous regulations
for the remaining duration to which the project is entitled to incentives. Therefore, schools operated pursuant to
operational licenses granted prior to the adoption of the new decree, are not required to amend their current
license to limit enrollment of Vietnamese students as prescribed by the decree. Do however note the “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are subject to rules arising from our ownership structures in_
_Thailand and Vietnam.”_

There are no restrictions for foreign-invested tertiary and vocational/short-term training establishments (i.e., up
to 100% of student recruits can be Vietnamese). Furthermore, schools that admit Vietnamese national students
are required to maintain provision of certain local subjects, as prescribed by the Minister of Education and
Training. We hold licenses at both International School Ho Chi Minh City and International School Ho Chi Minh
City, American Academy to teach an international curriculum to Vietnamese national students.

Schools in Vietnam must comply with a range of legislation and other directives that include child welfare and
protection, criminal records checks, health and safety, data protection, racial equality, disability discrimination,
food allergy and school trips.

**_Hong Kong_**

Section 3 of the Education Ordinance (Cap. 279) (“EO”) defines a “school” as “an institution, organization or
_establishment which provides for 20 or more persons during any one day or 8 or more persons at any one time,_
_any nursery, kindergarten, primary, secondary or post-secondary education or any other educational course by_
_any means, including correspondence delivered by hand or through the postal services.” Each category of_
institution is classified by age e.g. a nursery provides a one year course of education that normally begins when a
child turns 3, whereas a primary school provides a 6 year course of education normally commencing when a
child turns 6.

Generally, schools are regulated by the Education Bureau (“EDB”), in coordination with the following
government departments which make recommendations and issue requirements for school premises: Planning
Department (“PD”), Land Department (“LD”), Fire Services Department (“FSD”), Buildings Department
(“BD”)/ Independent Checking Unit, Office of the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Housing (Housing)
(“ICU”) and the Department of Health (“DH”).

Kindergarten falls within the definition of a “school”, but some kindergartens also provide child care services i.e.
as kindergarten-cum-child care centers. These are jointly regulated by the Social Welfare Department (“SWD”)
and the EDB (in collaboration with the above-mentioned government departments issuing premises
requirements) through the Joint Office for Kindergartens and Child Care Centers of the EDB (“Joint Office”).
Under section 2 of the Child Care Services Ordinance (Cap. 243) (“CCSO”), a “child care center” is defined as,
_inter alia, “any premises which habitually receive at any one time more than 5 children who are under the age of_

126


-----

_3 years for the purposes of care and supervision.” In this regard, kindergartens and/ or institutions which provide_
such services fall under the CCSO regime.

The majority of the Woodland schools operated by the Group are classified as playgroups and do not fall within
the remit of the EO or the CCSO and are therefore not required to be registered as long as the attending children
are accompanied by an adult parent or helper.

To operate a school in Hong Kong, an application must be submitted to the Permanent Secretary for Education
(the “Permanent Secretary”). Upon compliance and/or clearance with:

- PD on whether the proposed premise is permitted for school use under the Town Planning Ordinance (Cap.
131);

- LD on confirmation that school use does not contravene the lease condition of the proposed premises;

- FSD and BD/ICU on (fire) safety of the proposed premises; and

- EDB on the overall suitability of the school, taking into account, among other factors, school layout plans,
fees to be charged, syllabus, curriculum planning, meal plans for students, registration of the school
manager (on management and quality assurance of the school), employment expenditure of teaching staff,

the Permanent Secretary will grant a provisional registration to the school, as the Permanent Secretary thinks fit,
with a validity period of one year (the “Validity Period”). The Permanent Secretary may extend the period of
provisional registration of a school for a further period not exceeding 12 months at a time as he thinks fit. A
school that can demonstrate full compliance with further requirements of:

- EDB on school management (e.g. number of students enrolled, registration of teachers, etc.);

- DH on health-related requirements (e.g. sanitary facilities, water supply, school space, meals, etc.); and

- requirements set by FSD and BD/ICU (if any),

will be granted a full registration. A provisionally-registered school that fails to demonstrate full compliance and
has not been granted an extension on its Validity Period from the Permanent Secretary will become an
unregistered school upon expiry of such Validity Period and will have to cease operations.

There is no validity period once a school is fully registered, but such school is expected to remain compliant with
the application requirements throughout the registration period. A school registration may be cancelled in
accordance with section 22 of the EO, for example, for contravention of the EO, unsatisfactory school
management and/or where the relevant premises has become unsuitable for use as a school. The Permanent
Secretary may by order in writing close any premises of a school which is not registered or provisionally
registered.

In addition to obtaining the above-mentioned registration from the Permanent Secretary for operation of a school,
kindergarten-cum-child care centers should also apply for registration of a child care center within proposed/
registered kindergarten premises with the Joint Office. The requirements are similar to those of a kindergarten,
such as the clearance with FSD and BD/ICU on the safety of the premises; with additional applications covering,
among other things:

- registration of personal particulars of the operator of the child care center (as required under section 8 of the
CCSO and is open for public inspection);

- timetable of daily activities of the child care center;

- dietary scale and menu for centers operating full day services;

- application for approval of child care center fees; and

- name of the employee who holds a valid first aid certificate.

While kindergarten-cum-child care centers are expected to remain compliant with the application requirements,
there are particular on-going compliance requirements such as arrangement for regular inspection and
maintenance of fixed electrical installation and gas installation. The Certificate of Registration of a
kindergarten-cum-child care center will remain valid unless cancelled by the Joint Office pursuant to section 9 of
the CCSO (on grounds including contravention of the CCSO) and/or section 22 of the EO.

**Latin America**

**_Chile_**

The key regulators for educational matters in Chile are the Ministry of Education (Ministerio de Educacion or
“MINEDUC) and the Superintendence of Education (Superintendencia de Educacion). The MINEDUC oversees

127


-----

the performance of all the different agents involved in educational activities and it has a presence throughout the
country by means of regional offices (Secretaria Regional Ministerial or “SEREMI”). The Superintendence of
Education monitors recognized schools and its sponsors, ensuring that all recognized schools’ operations meet
the relevant regulations.

The main statute regarding schools is the General Law of Education (Law N° 20.370), which provides a series of
rights and obligations regarding students, parents, teachers, sponsors and schools. In addition, Decree N° 315
enacted by the MINEDUC sets forth the process and requirements for obtaining the State’s recognition for a
school, how to maintain it and what may cause its cancellation or revocation. Importantly, all private schools
(including those receiving state subsidies) must have a sponsor (or sostenedor) by law. In the case of private
schools the sponsor must be a private legal entity, which sole corporate purpose must be to act as a sponsor of an
educational establishment. The law does not discriminate between national and foreign sponsors, so there is no
issue concerning foreign ownership of schools, whether partial or absolute. Licensing is handled by the
corresponding SEREMI. The remaining regulations related to educational matters stem from the MINEDUC and
focus on specific issues, such as academic content for specific levels or the minimum requirements for being able
to teach in schools. Schools are subject to inspections performed by the Superintendence of Education. These
inspections may be previously arranged or may be random and unscheduled. The Superintendence of Education
may also impose four types of penalties to schools for legal or regulatory non-compliance: written
admonishments; fines, ranging from approximately $70 to $70,000 (in private schools, the average cost of tuition
is taken into consideration when determining the amount of the fine); temporary or definitive inability to act as
sponsor for a school; and revocation of the State’s recognition of the school. The harshness of the penalty
ultimately imposed shall depend on the seriousness of the school’s non-compliance or infraction, as well as its
cooperation or lack thereof in rectifying such non-compliance. In addition, the school may also be penalized with
fines or temporary closing of its premises if it fails to comply with the regulation concerning hygienic and
construction matters.

Admission requirements in private schools must be pursuant to objective, clear and non-arbitrary parameters and
must ensure the dignity of the applicants and their families. Provided this requirement is met, private schools are
free to set forth its own set of requirements, such as religious beliefs, nationality, academic performance, and
family composition. There are no statutes or regulations requiring a minimum percentage of Chilean students.
Private schools are also free to determine the amount, payment term and conditions of tuition and its related
admission process, enrollment, parent associations’ fees and any other costs of enrollment. During the academic
year, the school may not suspend or expel a student due to any unpaid and outstanding tuition fee.

Schools in Chile must also comply with hygiene and construction codes, as well with a wide ranging set of laws,
regulations and other directives that include child welfare and protection, criminal records checks, safety, data
protection, and disability discrimination.

**_Brazil_**

Brazilian schools must comply with federal regulations and guidelines as well as any applicable state or local
regulations. Brazil’s federal government regulates the country’s education system through the Ministry of
Education (Ministério da Educação), provided that federal, state and local governments organize, in cooperation,
the education system in the country, based on the guidelines issued by the federal government. Licensing is
handled by the school’s state or local government, depending upon the type of school. Specifically, state
governments are responsible for the licensing of all private elementary schools and high schools located within
their respective jurisdictions, while local governments are responsible for the licensing of private early childhood
education programs. Local and state governments are also responsible for establishing state education programs
for public schools following the guidelines and using the funding supplied by the federal government, in addition
to their own financial resources.

The rendering of educational services at any level is permitted to private entities, provided that these entities
(a) are in compliance with the regulations issued by the federal, state, and local governments, where applicable;
(b) obtain the required authorization from the competent governmental authority; and (c) are able to finance their
activities.

In order to maintain the required authorization from federal, state, and local governments, a private school must
satisfy certain requirements ranging from the suitability of its physical facilities to the qualification of its teachers
and the structure of its curriculum, among other specific requirements depending upon the type of school and the
level of education provided. The licensing authorities have the power to check compliance with such
requirements periodically and non-compliance may lead to the revocation of the school’s existing permits.

128


-----

Aside from certain age requirements in relation to the grade a student can be enrolled in, there are no specific
rules that Brazilian schools must follow when deciding whether or not to accept or maintain any given student.
However, regulators may levy sanctions against a school using discriminatory admissions or expulsion practices.

Private schools are unregulated with regards to determining tuition rates and charging any other fees to their
students. Additionally, provided that all foreign investment is duly registered in the Central Bank of Brazil
(Banco Central do Brasil), there are no restrictions in the remittance of funds (such as dividends and other
distributions) to a private school’s foreign investors.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements after giving effect to
the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom. The following summaries do not
purport to describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the actual agreements.

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

**Overview and Structure**

In connection with the Acquisition, Lernen Bidco Limited (“Bidco”) entered into a new multicurrency senior
facilities agreement (the “Senior Facilities Agreement”) on October 24, 2018 (as amended and restated on or
around November 22, 2018) with, among others, Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch as facility agent,
U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited,
Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and KKR Capital Markets Limited as mandated lead arrangers.
The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for committed facilities in the following amounts:

- a €255,275,698 senior secured term loan B1 facility (“Facility B1 (EUR)”);

- a £200,000,000 senior secured term loan B1 facility (“Facility B1 (GBP)” and together with “Facility B1
(EUR), “Facility B1”);

- a €52,551,816 senior secured term loan B2 facility (“Facility B2” and together with Facility B1, “Facility
B”); and

- a £100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility” and, together with Facility
B, the “Senior Facilities”).

All amounts under Facility B1 were utilized by Bidco on the Closing Date and applied towards the consideration
payable for the Acquisition, payment of fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Acquisition and the
refinancing, discharge and/or acquisition of existing Target Group debt and the payment of related costs or fees
to which any member of the Target Group was obligated to pay.

**Payment Blockage Provisions**

Until the Priority Discharge Date, if a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Event has occurred and is continuing,
except with the prior consent of the Required Priority Creditors and subject to certain provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, each Debtor shall procure that no Debtor or other member of the Group shall make, and
no Senior Subordinated Creditor (or Proceeds Lender) may receive from any Debtor or member of the Group,
any Payment in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities (and any Senior Subordinated Debt Proceeds Loan
Liabilities) from the date on which the relevant Creditor Representative under the Priority Creditor Debt
Documents delivers a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement
until the earliest of:

- the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice;

- in relation to payments of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities (and any corresponding Senior Subordinated
Debt Proceeds Loan Liabilities), if a Senior Subordinated Standstill Period is in effect at any time after
delivery of that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice, the date on which the Senior Subordinated
Standstill Period expires;

- the date on which the relevant Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Event is no longer continuing and, if the
relevant Priority Creditor Debt Liabilities have been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded,
revoked or waived, provided that at such time no other Event of Default is continuing under any Priority
Creditor Debt Document;

- the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice
delivers a notice in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement cancelling the Senior Subordinated
Payment Stop Notice; and

- the date on which the Senior Subordinated Creditors, the relevant Holdco Issuer or a Creditor
Representative in respect of any Senior Subordinated Liabilities is permitted to take Enforcement Action
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor, Security Grantor or member of the Group.

Unless each Creditor Representative in respect of the Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities waives this
requirement, (i) a new Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days
have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no
Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop
Event more than 45 days after the date on which each Creditor Representative received notice of that Senior
Subordinated Payment Stop Event.

A Creditor Representative may only serve one Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice with respect to the
same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right
of any other Creditor Representative to issue a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other
event or set of circumstances.

No Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Creditor Representative in respect of a Senior
Subordinated Payment Stop Event which had been notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Senior
Subordinated Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Subordinated Debt Documents or any Senior Subordinated
Proceeds Loan Agreement as a result of the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the
occurrence of a Senior Subordinated Automatic Block Event shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of
Default (or, in the case of any Senior Subordinated Debt Proceeds Loan Agreement, any event of default
thereunder (howsoever described)) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant
Senior Subordinated Debt Document (or, as the case may be, Senior Subordinated Debt Proceeds Loan
Agreement); or (ii) the issue of a Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice on behalf of the Senior Subordinated
Debt Creditors.

**Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue**

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall
continue to accrue) under any Senior Subordinated Debt Document by the operation of the provisions set out
under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Subordinated Liabilities” even if
its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

147


-----

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Subordinated Debt Documents
and/or any Senior Subordinated Debt Proceeds Loan Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Subordinated Automatic Block Event.

**Cure of Payment Stop**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Subordinated Automatic Block Event, that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or, as the case may be, the Senior Subordinated Automatic Block Event ceases to be
continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Subordinated Debt Creditor or the relevant Proceeds
Lender an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Senior Subordinated Debt
Documents or, as applicable, the relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Proceeds Loan Agreement and which
would have been Permitted Senior Subordinated Payments but for that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Subordinated Automatic Block Event,

then any Default or Event of Default (or, in the case of any Senior Subordinated Debt Proceeds Loan Agreement,
any default or event of default thereunder (howsoever described)) which may have occurred as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice which may have been
issued as a result of that Default or Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action
being required on the part of the Senior Subordinated Debt Creditor or, as the case may be, the relevant Proceeds
Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Subordinated Debt Creditors, the Holdco Issuer and other
Debtors and, where applicable, the relevant Proceeds Lender may amend or waive the terms of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Documents and/or Senior Subordinated Debt Proceeds Loan Agreement (other than the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Document) in accordance with their terms at any time.

_Security: Senior Subordinated Liabilities_

At any time prior to the Priority Discharge Date (except with consent), the Senior Subordinated Creditors may
not take accept or receive the benefit of any Security from (or over the assets of or shares in) the Debtors, any
Security Grantor or any member of the Group, or of any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance other than:

- as permitted under the Primary Creditor Documents and which, in the case of (i) any guarantee, indemnity
or assurance against loss, is offered to the other Primary Creditors in respect of their respective liabilities,
and in the case of (ii) any Security, is Senior Subordinated Common Security or (in the case of any Security
Grantor or any Debtor which is not a member of the Group) is offered as Common Transaction Security to
the Common Security Agent as trustee and/or agent for the other Priority Creditors in respect of their
Liabilities or in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective Security cannot be granted in favour of the
Common Security Agent as trustee and/or agent for the Primary Creditors:

(1) to the other Primary Creditors in respect of their Liabilities; or

(2) to the Common Security Agent under a parallel debt, joint and several creditorship or other similar or
equivalent structure for the benefit of the other Primary Creditors in respect of their Liabilities,

and, in each case, ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement;

- the Common Transaction Security;

- the Notes Escrow Security; and

- a Senior Subordinated Guarantee or any guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss granted pursuant to
the terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Document, in each case, provided such Senior Subordinated
Guarantee or other guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is from a Debtor which is a guarantor in
respect of the Priority Creditor Debt Liabilities and is permitted under the Priority Creditor Debt
Documents,

provided that the Proceeds Lender shall not in any event be entitled to any guarantee, indemnity Security or other
assurance against loss.

Debtor or any other person under the relevant Debt Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from the Purchasing Senior Subordinated Creditors (or from another third party
acceptable to all the relevant Priority Debt Creditors) in a form reasonably satisfactory to each relevant
Priority Debt Creditor in respect of all losses which may be sustained or incurred by such Priority Debt
Creditor in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any such party from any person being required
(or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from that Priority Debt Creditor for
any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Priority Debt Creditors,
except that each of them shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that
it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorise the making
by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Purchasing Senior Subordinated Creditors may only require a Priority
Creditor Debt Liabilities Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by
the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, no Priority Creditor Debt Liabilities Transfer may be required to be made.

At the request of a Creditor Representative under any Senior Subordinated Debt Document, the relevant Creditor
Representative under the Priority Creditor Debt Document shall notify the Senior Subordinated Creditors of the
foregoing payable sums in connection with such transfer.

**Effect of Insolvency Event**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in
relation to any member of the Group, a Security Grantor or a Debtor, any party entitled to receive a distribution
out of the assets of the Charged Property of that member of the Group, that Security Grantor or that Debtor (in
the case of a receipt by a Priority Creditor of a Payment or distribution of assets of a member of the Group or
Security Grantor, only to the extent that such amount constitutes Enforcement Proceeds) in respect of liabilities
owed to that party, that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the
distribution of the assets of that member of the Group, that Security Grantor or that Debtor to pay that
distribution to the Common Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in
full. In this respect, the Common Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any Debtor’s or any member of the Group’s liabilities are
discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to
that member of the Group or Debtor, any Creditor which benefited from that set-off shall (in the case of a
Priority Creditor, only to the extent that such amount constitutes Enforcement Proceeds) pay an amount equal to
the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Common Security Agent for
application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds’” below.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below, if the Common Security
Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the
liabilities (other than any distribution of Non-Cash Recoveries), the liabilities will not be reduced by that
distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any member of the Group, any Debtor or any Security
Grantor, each Creditor irrevocably authorises the Common Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against that
member of the Group, Debtor or Security Grantor;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of the liabilities of that member of the Group, Debtor or
Security Grantor;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of the liabilities of that member of the
Group, Debtor or Security Grantor; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Common Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover the liabilities of that member of the Group, Debtor or Security Grantor.

Each Creditor will (i) do all things that the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) requests in order to give effect to the matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency

152


-----

_Event” section and (ii) if the Common Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by_
this “—Effect of Insolvency Event” section or if the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) requests that a Creditor take that action, undertake that action itself in
accordance with the instructions of the Common Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the Common
Security Agent (on such terms as the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) may reasonably require) to enable the Common Security Agent to take such action.

**Turnover**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Creditor receives or recovers from
any Security Grantor, Debtor or member of the Group:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is neither a
payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement nor made in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event” any amount
by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not give effect to a payment
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the
caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event” any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress event (or as a
result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the Group, a Debtor or a Security Grantor
other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Group, Debtor
or Security Grantor); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a distress event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below
the caption “—Application of Proceeds;”

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set out below
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds;” or

(v) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in
relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group or a Debtor which is not in accordance with
the provisions set out in the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after,
the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of Group or that Debtor,

that Creditor will, subject to certain exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered
by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the
amount received or recovered) on trust for the Common Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute an amount
to the Common Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
(y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds
the relevant liabilities to the Common Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off,
promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Common Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

under the Transaction Security Documents except through the Common Security Agent.

**Manner of Enforcement: Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and Common Transaction Security**

If the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security or the Common Transaction Security is being enforced or other
action as to Enforcement is being taken as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—
_Enforcement Instructions: Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and Common Transaction Security”, the_
Common Security Agent shall enforce the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or the Common
Transaction Security or take other action as to Enforcement in such manner (including the selection of any
administrator (or any analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of any Debtor to be appointed by the Common
Security Agent) as:

- an Instructing Group shall instruct; or

- if prior to the Pari Passu Discharge Date, (i) the Common Security Agent has, pursuant to the third

_Transaction Security and Common Transaction Security” above, received instructions given by the Creditor_
Representative acting for the Second Lien Creditors to enforce the Common Transaction Security; and
(ii) the Instructing Group has not given instructions as to Enforcement, the Creditor Representative for the

of enforcement, the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors, shall instruct or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Common Security Agent sees fit.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law at the relevant time, each Creditor and each Security Grantor
will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory
authority in respect of any insolvency, pre- insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any
Debtor, Security Grantor or member of the Group as instructed by the Common Security Agent. The Common
Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other Primary Creditor under the
Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the
due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that Primary Creditor.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
each of the Secured Parties, the Debtors and the Security Grantors waive all rights it may otherwise have to

154


-----

require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or
that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the Transaction
Security or of any other Security, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured
Obligations, is so applied.

_Consultation Period_

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Common Security Agent to enforce
any Transaction Security or to take any other Enforcement Action, the Creditor Representative(s) of the
creditors of the Group represented in the Instructing Group concerned shall consult with each other creditor
representative (other than in respect of any Unsecured Creditors) (provided that the Creditor Representative
for any Senior Subordinated Debt Creditors or Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee need only be consulted if
such Enforcement Action relates to Common Transaction Security in respect of Senior Subordinated
Liabilities) and the Common Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the
Instructing Group for a period of up to 10 Business Days (the “Consultation Period”), and only following
the expiry of a Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the
Common Security Agent to enforce that Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) No Creditor Representative shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph (a) above and the
Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Common Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period if:

(i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any Creditor Representative of the Creditors represented in the Instructing
Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other Creditor Representative and the Common
Security Agent) that to enter into such consultation and thereby delay the commencement of
enforcement of the Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on:

(A) the Common Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security;

(iii) any action or proceedings have been threatened or commenced by any Second Lien Facility Lender or
any Second Lien Noteholder against any Pari Passu Creditor, any Affiliate of any Senior Secured
Facility Creditor, any Debtor or any Holding Company of any Debtor;

(iv) the Common Security Agent has obtained an independent valuation showing that the enterprise value
of the Group is less than the Pari Passu Liabilities; or

(v) any Second Lien Creditor:

perform its obligations under, or of any voluntary or mandatory prepayment arising under, the
Second Lien Debt Documents);

(B) declares that any of the Second Lien Liabilities are payable on demand;

(C) makes a demand in relation to a Second Lien Liability that is payable on demand;

(D) makes a demand against any Second Lien Guarantor in relation to any of its Guarantee Liabilities;

Liabilities, or has given any Security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in
respect of any of the Second Lien Liabilities, or any of such member of the Group’s assets, or any
analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction,

but excluding:

(1) the taking of any action falling within paragraph (E) or (G) above which is necessary (but
only to the extent necessary) to preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect
of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities; and

155


-----

(2) a Second Lien Creditor bringing legal proceedings against any person solely for the purpose
of (x) obtaining injunctive relief (or any analogous remedy outside England and Wales) to
restrain any actual or putative breach of any Second Lien Debt Document to which it is party,
(y) obtaining specific performance (other than specific performance of an obligation to make
a payment) with no claim for damages or (z) requesting judicial interpretation of any
provision of any Second Lien Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for damages.

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties, the Debtors and the Security Grantors
acknowledges that, in the event that the Common Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, any part of
the Transaction Security, the duties of the Common Security Agent and of any Receiver or Delegate owed to the
Secured Parties, the Debtors and the Security Grantors in respect of the method, type and timing of that
enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that Transaction Security shall, subject to
the section entitled Distressed Disposals below, be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the
Common Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors or Security Grantors under general law.

**Proceeds of Disposals**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

If:

(i) in respect of a disposal (to or with a person or persons outside the Group) of an asset:

(A) of a Debtor or a Security Grantor or a member of the Group or a Holding Company of a Debtor or a
Security Grantor or a member of the Group; or

(B) which is, or which is purported to be, the subject of the Transaction Security, the Priority Creditor Only
Transaction Security or the Common Transaction Security,

or any other transaction (other than any intra-Group transaction) not prohibited by the terms of any Primary
Creditor Document or any Unsecured Creditor Document pursuant to which such asset will cease to be held or
owned by a member of the Group, which (in each case) is not a Distressed Disposal and:

(1) if constituting Priority Creditor Only Charged Property:

       - (prior to the Pari Passu Discharge Date) is permitted under the Pari Passu Debt Documents or
consented to by the Required Pari Passu Creditors; and

       - (prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date) is permitted under the Second Lien Debt Documents or

consented to by the Required Second Lien Creditors; and

       - (prior to the Senior Subordinated Discharge Date) is permitted under the Senior Subordinated
Debt Documents or consented to by the Required Senior Subordinated Creditors,

or takes place after the later of the Pari Passu Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the
Senior Subordinated Discharge Date,

the disposal of (or, as the case may be, any other such transaction involving) that asset is a “Non-Distressed
**Disposal”; and**

(ii) in respect of, and in order to effect, any merger, reorganisation or transaction in connection with which:

(A) an asset of a Debtor or a Security Grantor or a member of the Group or a Holding Company of a
Debtor or a Security Grantor or a member of the Group; or

(B) an asset which is, or which is purported to be, the subject of, the Transaction Security, the Priority
Creditor Only Transaction Security or the Common Transaction Security,

156


-----

is, or is required to be, released from the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security, the Common Transaction
Security and/or the Transaction Security and/or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that asset,
where that merger, reorganisation or transaction is:

(1) (prior to the Pari Passu Discharge Date) permitted under the Pari Passu Debt Documents or consented
to by the Required Pari Passu Creditors;

(2) (prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date) permitted under the Second Lien Debt Documents or
consented to by the Required Second Lien Creditors; and

(3) (prior to the Senior Subordinated Discharge Date) permitted under the Senior Subordinated Debt
Documents or consented to by the Required Senior Subordinated Creditors,

that release of that asset shall be a “Mandatory Release”.

_Facilitation of Non-Distressed Disposals and Mandatory Releases_

(a) If the disposal of an asset is a Non-Distressed Disposal or Mandatory Release, the Common Security Agent
shall and is irrevocably authorised and obliged to (without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation) but subject to paragraph (b) below:

(i) release the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or the Common Transaction Security and/
or Transaction Security and/or any other claim (under or relating to a Debt Document) over that asset;

(ii) where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the Group, a Security Grantor or a
Debtor, release the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or the Common Transaction
Security and/or the Transaction Security and/or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that
persons and its Subsidiaries and any assets and Property of that person; and

(iii) execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or
the Common Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Security,

(b) If a Non-Distressed Disposal is not made, (i) each release of Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security
and/or the Common Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Security and/or any claim described in
paragraph (a) above shall have no effect and the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or the
Common Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Security and/or claim subject to that release shall
continue in such force and effect as if that release had not been effected (to the extent possible under
applicable law); and (ii) the Parties agree that, to the extent required under applicable law, any Priority
Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or the Common Transaction Security and/or the Transaction
Security released or purported to be released shall promptly be retaken on substantially the same terms.

(c) Each release of Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security, Common Transaction Security, and/or
Transaction Security and/or any claim shall become effective only on the making of the relevant NonDistressed Disposal or time of the relevant merger, reorganisation or transaction.

(d) The Common Security Agent may in its absolute discretion, rely on a certification from the Holdco Issuer,
the Company or a Debtor that the disposal of an asset is a Non-Distressed Disposal or the release of an asset
is a Mandatory Release.

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of any Charged Property or an asset of a member of the Group,
Debtor or Security Grantor which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances
where the Transaction Security has become enforceable, (b) being effected by enforcement of any Transaction
Security or (c) being effected after the occurrence of a Distress Event by, or on behalf of, a Debtor or Security
Grantor to any person or persons which is not a member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal or an Appropriation of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the
Common Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Company, or if the Company
selects, the relevant Debtor or Security Grantor, and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any Creditor, any other Secured Party, any Debtor, any Affiliate Creditor or any Security
Grantor):

(i) to release the Priority Only Transaction Security and/or the Common Transaction Security or any other
claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that Priority Creditor Only

157


-----

Transaction Security and/or the Common Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Common
Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor, to release:

(A) that Debtor and any Subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its Borrowing Liabilities, its
Guarantee Liabilities and its Other Liabilities;

(B) any Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or the Common Transaction Security granted by
that Debtor or any Subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an Affiliate Creditor, Security Grantor or Intra-Group Lender or another Debtor over
that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any Subsidiary of that Debtor, including any Intra-Group
Liability, Affiliate Creditor Liability and/or any Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivable,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Security Grantors;

(iii) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of any
Holding Company of a Debtor, to release:

(A) that Holding Company and any Subsidiary of that Holding Company from all or any part of its
Borrowing Liabilities, its Guarantee Liabilities and its Other Liabilities;

(B) any Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or the Common Transaction Security granted by
that Holding Company or any Subsidiary of that Holding Company, over any of their respective assets;
and

(C) any other claim of an Affiliate Creditor, Security Grantor, an Intra-Group Lender or another Debtor
over the assets of any Subsidiary of that Holding Company, including any Intra-Group Liability,
Affiliate Creditor Liability and/or any Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivable,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Security Grantors;

(iv) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor
or the Holding Company of a Debtor and the Common Security Agent decides to dispose of all or any part
of the Liabilities or the Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivables owed by that Debtor or Holding Company or any
Subsidiary of that Debtor or Holding Company on the basis that any transferee of those Liabilities or
Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivables (the “Transferee”) should not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of all or part of those Liabilities or Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivables, provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement;

(v) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor
or the Holding Company of a Debtor and the Common Security Agent decides to dispose of all or part of the
Liabilities or the Debtor’s Intra-Group Receivables owed by that Debtor or Holding Company or any
subsidiary of that Debtor or Holding Company on the basis that any transferee of those Liabilities or
Debtor’s Intra-Group Receivables will be treated as a Primary Creditor or Secured Party for the purpose of
the Intercreditor Agreement to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of:

(A) all (and not part only) of the Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors; and

(B) all or part of any other Liabilities and the Debtors Intra-Group Receivables,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors and Debtors.

(vi) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor
or the Holding Company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Common Security Agent (acting in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Group Debtor (the “Receiving
Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any Subsidiary of that
Disposed Entity in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities or the Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivables, to execute
and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtors’ Intra-Group
Receivables on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

158


-----

(B) accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or
Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivables on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtors’ Intra-Group Receivables are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal and each Debt Disposal shall be paid to the Common Security
Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds’”,
as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of Transaction Security and, to the extent that any
Liabilities Sale or any Appropriation has occurred, as if that Liabilities Sale, or any reduction in the Secured
Obligations resulting from that Appropriation, had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal or a Liabilities Sale effected by, or at the request of, the Common Security
Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Common Security Agent shall take
reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Common Security
Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or Liabilities Sale in order to
achieve a higher price).

Where Borrowing Liabilities constituted pursuant to notes issued pursuant to any Notes Indenture (other than a
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture) would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Common Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group may, by written notice to the
Company and relevant Creditor Representatives cause the transfer of the whole or any part of Borrowing
Liabilities. On receipt by the Company of such notice, the Borrowing Liabilities shall immediately and
automatically without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Secured Party
or Debtor by transferred by novation.

If a Distressed Disposal or Liabilities Sale is being effected by or at the request of the Common Security Agent,
the Common Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions. Such obligations shall only be taken to have been discharged under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
other Debt Documents and generally at law if the requirements of the applicable conditions in the Intercreditor
Agreement are met, and it is a condition that:

(i) the Creditor Representative in respect of the Second Lien Debt Creditors has approved the release on the
instructions of the Required Second Lien Creditors;

(ii) that Distressed Disposal or Liabilities Sale is made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process; or

(iii) in circumstances where:

    - the Common Security Agent considers that a Competitive Sales Process is not reasonably practicable
or, following an attempted sale or disposal, the Pari Passu Creditors make the highest final binding
offer of all of the offers received but that offer is less than the aggregate par value of the Pari Passu
Liabilities, a Financial Advisor selected by the Common Security Agent has delivered a Fairness
Opinion in respect of such sale or disposal; and

    - at the time of completion of the sale or disposal (1) all Primary Creditor Liabilities are (to the same
extent) released or unconditionally transferred to the purchaser and (2) all the Transaction Security
granted in favour of the Primary Creditors over the assets sold or disposal of is released, unless either:

(I) the Instructing Group, acting reasonably and in good faith, determine that a sale or disposal of any
relevant claim will facilitate a greater recovery for the Pari Passu Creditors than if such claim was
released and/or unconditionally transferred; or

(II) in circumstances where either (1) the Pari Passu Discharge Date has occurred or (2) there has been
a bona fide and fully committed cash bid in an amount equal to or exceeding the aggregate par
value of the Pari Passu Liabilities (but not exceeding the aggregate par value of the Second Lien
Liabilities) at a time when the Creditor Representatives for the Second Lien Creditors are entitled
to give, and have given, instructions under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor
Representatives of the Second Lien Facility or Second Lien Notes, acting reasonably and in good
faith, determine that a sale, disposal or transfer of any relevant claim will facilitate a greater
recovery by the Second Lien Creditors than one they would achieve if the claim was released and/
or unconditionally transferred,

and the Instructing Group or relevant Creditor Representative gives notice of its determination to the
Common Security Agent and the other Creditor Representatives in which case the Common Security
Agent shall be entitled to immediately sell and transfer the relevant claim to such purchaser, or, if
either paragraph (ii) or (iii) above applies and a Pari Passu Creditor or a Second Lien Creditor is the

159


-----

successful bidder of the relevant disposal, such Pari Passu Creditor or Second Lien Creditor shall be
able to retain its relevant claim or any part thereof (which shall be valued at par).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Subordinated Creditors_

If a Distressed Disposal or a Liabilities Sale is being effected:

(a) the Common Security Agent is not authorised to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company from
any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities owed to any Priority Creditor except in accordance with
the section entitled “—Proceeds of Disposal: Distressed Disposals” above;

(b) at a time when the Creditor Representatives for the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors, or, as the case
may be, Second Lien Creditors are entitled to and have given instructions in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, (1) the Common Security Agent is not authorised to release any Debtor,
Subsidiary or Holding Company from any Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities
and, in each case (as applicable) any other Priority Creditor Liabilities or, as the case may be, Pari Passu
Liabilities unless those liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in cash in full upon that release, and (2) no
Distressed Disposal or Debt Disposal may be made for non-cash Consideration without the Instructing
Group’s consent.

If, before the Senior Subordinated Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal or Liabilities Sale is being effected such
that the Senior Subordinated Liabilities or Common Transaction Security or the assets of a Senior Subordinated
Guarantor or the relevant Holdco Issuer will be released under the distressed disposal mechanic in the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a condition to the release that either:

(a) each Creditor Representative in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities has approved the release on
the instructions of the Required Senior Subordinated Creditors; or

(b) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are applied in accordance with the “—Application of Proceeds” section
below and:

(i) that Distressed Disposal is made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process; or

(ii) in circumstances where:

(A)

1. the Common Security Agent acting in good faith considers that a sale or disposal made
pursuant to paragraph (i) above is not reasonably practicable taking into account all
circumstances; or

2. following an attempted sale or disposal under paragraph (i) above, the Priority Creditors
made the highest final bidding offer but that offer is less than the aggregate par value of the
Priority Creditor Liabilities,

a Financial Advisor appointed by the Common Security Agent in accordance with the relevant
provision in the Intercreditor Agreement has delivered a fairness opinion to the Common Security
Agent in respect of such disposal or sale; and

(B) the sale, disposal or transfer complies with the provisions relating to fair value in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**Application of Proceeds**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that Secured Parties may only benefit from Common Recoveries (as
defined below) to the extent that the liabilities of such Secured Parties has the benefit of the guarantees or
security under which such Common Recoveries are received and provided that, in all cases, the rights of such
secured parties shall in any event be subject to the priorities set out in this section.

_Order of Application_

Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Debt Document or in connection with the realization (including any
Distressed Disposal) or enforcement of all or any part of the Priority Creditor Only Transaction Security and/or
the Common Transaction Security and all Enforcement Proceeds (for the purposes of this “—Application of
_Proceeds” section, the “Common Recoveries”) shall be applied by the Common Security Agent at any time as_

Generally, all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Common Security Agent from or in
respect of a Holdco Issuer that is not a member of the Group pursuant to the terms of a Debt Document (other
than in connection with the realization or enforcement of all or part of the Transaction Security) shall be held by
the Common Security Agent on trust to apply them at any time as the Common Security Agent (in its discretion)
sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law in the following order of priority:

Document, in payment to any person to whom the Common Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to
any Debtor or Security Grantor; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors**

The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that if, for any reason, any Pari Passu Liabilities, any Second
Lien Liabilities or any Senior Subordinated Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the
resulting losses are not borne by the Pari Passu Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors or the Senior Subordinated
Creditors respectively in the proportions which their respective Exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the
aggregate Exposures of all the Pari Passu Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors or the Senior Subordinated
Creditors at the Enforcement Date, the Pari Passu Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors or the Senior
Subordinated Creditors (as applicable) will make such payments among themselves as the Common Security
Agent shall require to put the relevant Pari Passu Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors or the Senior Subordinated
Creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those
proportions.

**Required Consents**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement may be
amended or waived or any consent may be given under it, with only the consent of the relevant Creditor
Representatives and the Company and the Common Security Agent, provided that:

(i) if the relevant action, amendment or waiver or consent is permitted or not prohibited by the relevant
underlying Debt Document to which the action, amendment waiver or consent relates, the consent of the
relevant Creditor Representative shall be deemed to be given for all purposes under and in connection with
the Intercreditor Agreement;

(ii) no such amendment, waiver or consent shall require the consent or approval of any Hedge Counterparty,
provided that an amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing certain
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or the order and priority of subordination under the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case in a manner which would materially and adversely affect such Hedge Counterparty,
shall require the consent of such Hedge Counterparty; and

(iii) no such amendment, waiver or consent shall require the consent or approval of any Unsecured Creditor
unless such amendment, waiver or consent is expressed to impose additional restrictions on the rights or

162


-----

increases the obligations of any Unsecured Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement in their capacity as
such, in which case such amendment, waiver or consent shall also require the consent of each such
Unsecured Creditor. Subject to the foregoing, any amendment, waiver or consent made without the consent
of the Unsecured Creditors in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement shall enter into full force and
effect and be binding on all such Unsecured Creditors.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended by the Company and the Common Security Agent without the
consent of any other party, to cure defects or omissions or resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or correct
manifest errors if such amendment or waiver if of a minor technical or administrative nature.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement and unless the
provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, or if authorized by an Instructing Group, and if the
relevant Debtor consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant consents or releases
under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “—Exceptions” below, any amendment or
waiver of, or consent under, any security document which would materially adversely affect the nature or scope
of the charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed
requires approval as set out under the section captioned “—Required Consents.”

_Exceptions_

Subject to the following paragraph of this “—Exceptions’” section, an amendment, waiver or consent which
adversely relates to the personal rights or obligations of a Creditor Representative, an Arranger, the Common
Security Agent or a Hedge Counterparty (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent
of that Creditor Representative or, as the case may be, that Arranger, the Common Security Agent or that Hedge
Counterparty.

The foregoing shall not apply:

- to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or

- to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “—
_Proceeds of Disposals” above._

The first paragraph of this “—Exceptions” section shall apply to an arranger only to the extent that the arranger
liabilities are then owed to that arranger.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything
in the debt documents to the contrary.

**Local Facilities**

**Brazil**

Gaylussac Empreendimentos Educacionais Ltda entered into loan facilities with Itau and HSBC Brasil (later
acquired by Bradesco) in June 2014 in an aggregate amount of BRL 40 million (the “GayLussac Brazilian Local
Facilities”), of which BRL 15.2 million (£2.8 million) was outstanding as of August 31, 2018. These facilities
were drawn to finance the acquisition of our GayLussac school. The GayLussac Brazilian Local Facilities accrue
interest at a rate of Taxa DI + 3.75%. The loans mature in June 2020. The primary security for the GayLussac
Brazilian Local Facilities is a mortgage over the assets of the GayLussac school property and a pledge over the
shares of certain of our Brazilian subsidiaries, the school´s receivables and certain bank accounts. Pursuant to the
GayLussac Brazilian Local Facilities, Gaylussac Empreendimentos Educacionais Ltda, Cognita Brasil Locadora
de Imoveis 2 Ltda and GRS2 SA may not distribute dividends to the Group in excess of 25% of the net profits
generated by these entities without prior consent from the lenders.

**Chile**

Our Chilean subsidiaries have entered into 11 loan facilities totaling CLP 41,095 million (£45.2 million) (the
“Chilean Local Facilities”) as of August 31, 2018. The Chilean Local Facilities all accrue interest at fixed rates

163


-----

between 3.8% and 5.4%. These loans mature between 2022 and 2032. The primary securities for each of the
Chilean Local Facilities are first ranking security interests over the land and buildings of the relevant borrower.
Desarrolles Educacionales SA is also jointly and severably liable for each loan facility.

The Group’s Chilean subsidiaries also have CLP 820 million working capital facilities and a CLP 786 million
overdraft facility which we expect will remain undrawn as of the Issue Date.

**Spain**

English Montessori School SAU entered into two loan facilities with Banco Popular Español S.A, dated April 11,
2017 and March 23, 2018. The aggregate amount of these facilities is €2.8 million (£2.2 million). These loans
mature in April 2022 and March 2023, and they are non-secured.

**Finance Leases**

On March 1, 2017, we completed a ground rent sale and leaseback of the freehold properties at four of our UK
schools for total consideration of £12.7 million. In addition, in February 2018, we completed a ground rent sale
and leaseback of freehold properties at five UK schools for total consideration of £9.9 million. The purchasers
simultaneously granted the Group 150-year leases over the properties on the expiry of which, the Group will
have the option to buy back the freehold interest for £1 per property. For a description of our current obligations
under finance leases, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Contractual Obligations.”_

**Intercompany Loan**

On or about the Acquisition Completion Date, the Issuer lent to Lernen Bidco Limited, pursuant to an
intercompany loan (the “Intercompany Loan”), the amounts drawn by the Issuer under the Bridge Facility. The
aggregate principal amount of the Intercompany Loan equals the Bridge Facility proceeds less certain fees and
expenses. The currency of the Intercompany Loan is Pound sterling, in line with the Company’s currency of
account. The Intercompany Loan is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer will grant a security interest in respect of the receivables
under the Intercompany Loan to secure, among other things, the Senior Facilities Agreement (on a senior basis)
and the Notes (on a subordinated basis). See “Summary—The Offering—Security.”

It is anticipated that funds received by the Issuer as payments of interest under the Intercompany Loan will be
used, among other sources, to service interest payments under the Notes. The Intercompany Loan may have a
variable interest rate and a rate that differs from the rate of interest payable on the Notes from time to time. The
principal on the Intercompany Loan may be repaid in order to service interest payments on the Notes or
otherwise. As a result the initial amount of the Intercompany Loan may be less than the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes and may be reduced, potentially to zero, prior to the maturity of the Notes. Payments under
the Intercompany Loan may also be restricted by the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, subsidiaries of the
Issuer may upstream further funds as needed by means of dividends or loans.

-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €255.3 million aggregate principal amount of per cent. Senior Notes
due 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Lernen Bondco PLC, a public limited company incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated
basis by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (together, the “Guarantors”). In this “Description of the Notes,” the
“Issuer” refers only to Lernen Bondco PLC, and any successor obligor to Lernen Bondco PLC on the Notes, and
not to any of its subsidiaries. The Issuer has been incorporated as a public limited company under the laws of
England and Wales.

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer to repay amounts
outstanding under the Bridge Facility and to pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” The proceeds from
the Bridge Facility, together with proceeds from the drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement, were used
to finance the acquisition by Lernen Bidco Limited, a direct Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, of all of the
issued and outstanding share capital of the Target. See “Summary — The Transactions.”

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”) among, inter
_alios, the Issuer and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will be issued in private_
transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, see “Transfer Restrictions.”
The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under,
incorporate provisions by reference to, or otherwise be subject to, the Trust Indenture Act. The Notes are subject
to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and holders of the Notes are referred to the
Indenture for a statement thereof.

The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(defined below) and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (defined below) that may be entered in the future.
The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms and the ranking of the Notes
Guarantees, please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for a summary of the
material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes, and refers to
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Security Documents and does not purport to be complete and is subject
to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture and the Notes, and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain
all the information that is important to you. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor
Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as described under “Where Prospective Investors Can
_Find More Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain_
_Definitions.”_

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is
not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of per cent. per annum and will be payable, in cash, semiannually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2019 to holders of record on
the Business Day immediately preceding the interest payment date.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has
been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

If the interest payment date in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day, the holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any further interest
or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the headings
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” the Issuer
is permitted to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except in
respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
(“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, if
applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date

166


-----

or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of
holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which
cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable
(including any currency indemnity);

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the
_Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date_
as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the
initial Notes, and shall be deemed to form one series and references to the Notes shall be deemed to include the
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well any such Additional Notes; provided, however, that such
Additional Notes shall be issued under a separate CUSIP, ISIN and Common Code unless the Additional Notes
are issued pursuant to a “qualified reopening” of the Notes, are otherwise treated as part of the same “issue” of
debt instruments as the Notes or are issued with no more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount, in
each case for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (defined below), if any, on the Global Notes (as
defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all
such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by
a nominee of the common depositary for accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to Euroclear or Clearstream, which will credit the account specified
by the holder or holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined_
below) maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by
wire transfer to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See
“—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes for so long as the
Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will be Elavon Financial Services DAC,
UK Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). The Issuer will also maintain one or
more transfer agents (each, a “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and
the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch. The Registrar and the Transfer
Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time,
if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.
The Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
holders of the Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Notes.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of the
Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will initially be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

- The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

- The 144A Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

- The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global
_Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”)._

- The Regulation S Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of
interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In
addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will
be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and
governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with
such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Registered
Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Definitive Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Definitive Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to such
Registered Notes; or

168


-----

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the holder
of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries.

In the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be
permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Notes Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, will, subject to certain contractual and legal limitations and
the Agreed Security Principles, be guaranteed by the Guarantors (such guarantee, a “Notes Guarantee”).

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by Lernen Bidco Limited. It is intended that as soon as
practicable but in any case by no later than the date falling 120 days after the Issue Date, the Notes will be
guaranteed by:

(i) Australian International School Pte Ltd (Singapore);

(ii) Stamford American International School Pte Ltd (Singapore); and

(iii) Cognita Schools Limited (UK).

It is intended that the Guarantors will grant the Notes Guarantees and will also grant senior guarantees of the
Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes
_Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, it is intended that_
each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Senior Facilities Agreement or certain other
indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements – Senior Facilities Agreement”.

As of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the Guarantors represented, based on their contribution in
our consolidated financial statements, 59% of revenue, 70% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Offering
Memorandum) and 52% of assets. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information— Target and Future
_Guarantor Coverage.” As of August 31, 2018, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and_
the use of proceeds therefrom, on a consolidated basis, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes would
have had €50.2 million in outstanding debt. Only certain subsidiaries will provide Notes Guarantees and
guarantee obligations under the Notes. Our subsidiaries organized in Brazil, Chile, Spain, Vietnam, Thailand and
Mainland China (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, Hong Kong) will not guarantee the obligations under the
Notes. A consolidated total coverage ratio calculated on this basis does not necessarily reflect the individual asset
positions of corporate entities in the event of insolvency.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of
guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other limitations or
legal or regulatory requirements or other restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, liquidity protection
rules, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise
required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other
laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less
than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Each
_Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure— Our subsidiaries located in Spain, Chile, Brazil,_
_Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam will not guarantee the Notes, and the Notes and each of the Guarantees will_
_be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries_
_and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes.”_

169


-----

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon:

- a sale, exchange, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including by way of consolidation, merger,
amalgamation or combination) of ownership interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent
company) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, including for the avoidance of
doubt, any liquidation or dissolution or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor), in each case, otherwise permitted
by, and in compliance with, the Indenture;

- the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued under the
Indenture or defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction
_and Discharge;”_

- with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its
liability with respect to the Senior Facilities Agreement and (ii) does not guarantee any other Credit Facility
or Public Debt;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”

- with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation
or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—
_Guarantors;” and_

- in connection with a Permitted Reorganization or solvent winding-up or liquidation (or similar) of a
Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary remain
owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, or as otherwise contemplated by
the Indenture, the Trustee will execute any documents delivered to it by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect
such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee and any related Collateral. None of the
Issuer, Trustee nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release,
discharge or termination.

Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of nonguarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees
issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of
creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee
therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a
number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by
Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Subordination of the Guarantees**

Each of the Guarantees is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, each such Guarantee ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and
future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor, including any obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging agreements and any other indebtedness ranking pari
_passu therewith incurred after the Issue Date. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under_
their Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the
Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the Issue Date.

In addition, the Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but
not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing
group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of
Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes in
any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or
no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior

170


-----

Indebtedness. The Guarantees will also be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including payment
blockage and standstill on enforcement upon a senior default. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the
Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements- Intercreditor Agreement”.

**The Intercompany Loan**

On or about the Completion Date, the Issuer lent to Lernen Bidco Limited, pursuant to an intercompany loan (the
“Intercompany Loan”), the amounts drawn by the Issuer under the Bridge Facility. The aggregate principal
amount of the Intercompany Loan equals the Bridge Facility proceeds less certain fees and expenses. The
currency of the Intercompany Loan is Pound sterling, in line with the Company’s currency of account. The
Intercompany Loan is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer will grant a security interest in respect of the receivables under the
Intercompany Loan to secure, among other things, the Senior Facilities Agreement (on a senior basis) and the
Notes (on a subordinated basis). See “—Security.”

It is anticipated that funds received by the Issuer as payments of interest under the Intercompany Loan will be
used, among other sources, to service interest payments under the Notes. The Intercompany Loan may have a
variable interest rate and a rate that differs from the rate of interest payable on the Notes from time to time. The
principal on the Intercompany Loan may be repaid in order to service interest payments on the Notes or
otherwise. As a result the initial amount of the Intercompany Loan may be less than the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes and may be reduced, potentially to zero, prior to the maturity of the Notes. Payments under
the Intercompany Loan may also be restricted by the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, subsidiaries of the
Issuer may upstream further funds as needed by means of dividends or loans.

**Security**

**The Collateral**

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into on or prior to Issue Date, the Issuer will grant in favor of
the Security Agent, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted
Collateral Liens, security over:

(i) the shares held by the Issuer in Lernen Bidco Limited; and

(ii) an assignment by way of security of any existing and future intercompany loans in respect of which the
Issuer is the creditor and Lernen Bidco Limited is the debtor, including the Intercompany Loan,

each on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement (together, the “Initial Collateral,”
and together with any other security granted by the Issuer or its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes, the “Collateral”).

All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and
any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and may also secure Hedging
Obligations and additional Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral. Pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and any Hedging
Obligations and certain other Indebtedness including future Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
covenant “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness” will rank prior to and receive priority over any
obligations to holders of the Notes with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any
Collateral. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in_
connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any
Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds
received upon any enforcement over any Collateral, after all liabilities in respect of obligations secured on a
senior basis to, or ranking in priority to, the Notes have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro
rata in payment of all liabilities in respect of obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and any other
Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral
pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on an equal ranking basis with the Notes.

**Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. The enforcement of the Security
Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the
Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

171


-----

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law
limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_

In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted under the
Agreed Security Principles and applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other
laws. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, the terms of the Security Documents themselves provide for
assets to cease to become subject to security in certain circumstances without need for a formal release, such as
the sale of assets which are subject to a charge, or the exclusion of certain assets if such assets may not be subject
to security (such as, for example, assets that may not be validly pledged, or assets that are subject to a Permitted
Lien).

As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Notes and a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest_
_will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Collateral provider will
have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than
as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any
income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the
issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes, the payment of obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be
sold in a short period of time or at all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability of the
Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some
or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Trustee for the Notes has, and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other
relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it
is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights,
power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) and each holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Priority**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and other future indebtedness that is pari passu with the indebtedness under the Senior Facilities
Agreement; (b) the counterparties under certain hedging obligations; and (c) the Trustee and the holders under
the Indenture, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which
provide that the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will receive proceeds of enforcement of security
over the Collateral only after indebtedness, claims and obligations under and in respect of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and creditors under any future indebtedness that may be secured on a
first ranking or priority basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement have
been satisfied. See “Description of Other Indebtedness— Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. Under certain circumstances, the creditors under such Indebtedness

172


-----

will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Trustee and the holders under the
Indenture. See “—Release of Liens” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**Release of Liens**

The Security Agent will, and to the extent required or necessary, the Trustee will, in addition to the
circumstances described above, take any action reasonably required to effectuate any release of Collateral:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued under the
Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance with the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture, the
release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person other than the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) that is permitted by the Indenture (with respect to the Lien on such_
Collateral) or (b) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, Public Debt or such other Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over
such Collateral is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge thereof); provided that such
release would otherwise be permitted by another clause above;

(6) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation;” and

(7) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary, the Trustee
without the consent of the holders.

The Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may also, among other things,
without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with
respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation: (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or
series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security Documents which has become
worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or useful in the business; (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise
disposing of current assets in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) any other action permitted by the Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is
permitted and ranked pari passu or senior or junior in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee and/or to
share in any of the Collateral (and which the Issuer elects shall share in the Collateral), the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall, at the request of the Issuer, enter into with the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries
and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or more intercreditor
agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor
Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favorable to the holders) and substantially similar as applies to
sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security; provided that
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the personal rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee such
documentation in relation thereto as it may reasonably require. As used herein, a reference to the Intercreditor
Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

173


-----

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness
is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries and other
Persons to the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) facilitate a
transaction, reorganization, incurrence or other action or event permitted, or not otherwise prohibited, by the
Indenture, (6) make provision to implement any Permitted Lien or Permitted Collateral Liens in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, (7) make any other change to any agreement that does not adversely affect the holders
of Notes in any material respect or (8) as permitted pursuant to or contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted
by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee
or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, any amendments referenced above, and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement on each holder’s behalf.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available to the
holders upon request and will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business
Day upon prior written request at the office of the Issuer.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not redeemable at the
option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to, 2021, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal
amount of such Notes plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2021, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in
part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to the
applicable percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the
redemption date:

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2021, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, the Issuer may redeem up to 40 per cent. of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to (i) per cent. of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from one or more
Equity Offerings, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to (but excluding) the applicable
redemption date; provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing and receipt of the net cash
proceeds of the related Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 60 per cent. of the original principal amount of the Notes being redeemed (including the
principal amount of any Additional Notes of the same series) remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof.

174


-----

**General**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the
consummation of such Equity Offering).

Notwithstanding anything else in the Indenture or the Notes, redemption notices may be given more than 60 days
prior to a redemption date if the notice is in connection with a defeasance of Notes or a satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, notify the Exchange of such
optional redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of
a series of Notes validly tender and do not withdraw Notes of such series in a tender offer or other offer and the
Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes of such series
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 day’s prior notice to the holders of the relevant series of Notes, given not more
than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following
such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other holder of such series of Notes in such tender offer
(other than any incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the redemption date.
In determining whether the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series
of Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes of such series in a tender offer or other offer to purchase
for all of the Notes of such series, as applicable, Notes of such series owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by
funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no book-entry interest of €100,000 may be
redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream or Euroclear or Clearstream
prescribe no method of selection, the Notes will be selected on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor;
_provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and_
only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be
liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the
name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions
contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Company may redeem, and a Guarantor may cause the Issuer or Successor Company to
redeem, the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent.

of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption
(a “Tax Redemption Date” (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become
due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment
or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or Successor Company under or with respect to the Notes or Guarantor is, or on the next interest
payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable
but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of
redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective
on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum and must not have been publicly or formally announced in
substantially the form as enacted prior to the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to
withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or
after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and must not have been publicly or
formally announced in substantially the form as enacted prior to such date, unless the Change in Tax Law would
have applied to the predecessor of a Successor Company or the predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor. Notice
of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier
than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of any Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where
applicable, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer or
Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been complied with or
satisfied, and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or
Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, has or have been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Payor (as defined
below) is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or in which it has a
permanent establishment, or any jurisdiction from or through which a payment on the Notes or any Notes
Guarantees is made by or on behalf of any successor to the Payor, and any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on or with respect to the Notes or the
Notes Guarantees, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding
for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) England and Wales or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power
to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause
(1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

176


-----

will at any time be required by law from any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor on or with respect to any
Note or Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the
Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the holders after such
withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will
equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes
Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts
will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant
holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation)
and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, being a citizen or resident or national or
domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or
holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note Guarantee or the receipt of
any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of the failure by the holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the holder or beneficial owner,
after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by applicable law,
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with
respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes, assessment or
other governmental charge, or excise Taxes on a transfer or exchange of the Notes; or

(5) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable if the payment could have been made without such deduction
or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is
permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for
payment to the holder (except to the extent that the beneficiary would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period).

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any holder who is a fiduciary or
a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor
with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such
Notes directly.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees or this “Description of Notes”, any
amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding
imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or
any regulations thereunder or official interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between the
United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or any fiscal or regulatory
legislation, rules or practices implementing such an intergovernmental agreement) (any such withholding or
deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”). Neither the Issuer nor any other person will be required to pay any
additional amounts in respect of FATCA Withholding.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor and will provide such certified
copies to the Trustee.

177


-----

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note or Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts
to holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises, or the Payor
becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the
payment date). The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in
any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, transfer, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including penalties or interest related thereto) that arise in any
jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, issuance, registration, enforcement of or receipt of payments with
respect to any Notes, the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees, the Security Documents or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer or exchange of the Notes after the consummation of this
offering), and the Payor agrees to indemnify the holders for any such Taxes paid by such holders; provided, the
Payor will not be obligated, except in the case of enforcement following a default (or event of default), to pay
any such Taxes, charges or levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction provided
further, in the case of taxes, charges or levies attributable to any payments with respect to any Notes, the
Indenture, the Notes Guarantees, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto,
the Payor’s obligations under this paragraph shall be limited to any such taxes, charges or levies that are not
excluded under clauses (1), (2) and (4)-(6) above. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will survive any
termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in
which any successor to the Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which a payment on the Notes or any Notes Guarantees is made by
or on behalf of any successor to the Payor, and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each holder will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase all or part (equal to €100,000 aggregate principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof), as the case may be, of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 per cent. of the
principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of purchase (subject to
the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this
“—Change of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to
redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60_
days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder
of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 per cent. of the principal
amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to
the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

178


-----

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a holder must follow
in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so
tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the
aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of
Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order
to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by
the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly deliver via wire
transfer to each holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such
Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to each holder of
Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at
least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of
the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the
Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder’s right to require the Issuer to
repurchase such holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking
to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes validly tender
and do not withdraw Notes of such series in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making
a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes of such series
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant
to a Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment
date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes
of such series in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of such series, as applicable, Notes of such series
owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of Change of Control Offer.

179


-----

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations, or require a repurchase of the Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by
virtue of the conflict.

Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control (as described therein) would require
the repayment of such debt in certain circumstances. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities”.
The terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and other indebtedness of the Issuer or
its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide
that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by
the holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a
repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase
on the Issuer.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be
available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and Our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an_
_offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as required by each Indenture and the_
_change of control provision contained in each Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of_
_certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**Limitation on Indebtedness**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma
application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have been at
least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility (including
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility), and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof, and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a maximum aggregate
principal amount of Indebtedness at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of (a) £575.0 million
and (b) 575 per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) the Accordion Amount, plus (iii) in the case of any
refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount
of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

(2)

(a) guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of
the Indenture; or

180


-----

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason
of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) if any Guarantor or the Issuer is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the obligee is not a
Guarantor or the Issuer, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to prior payment
in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise) and the performance in full of
its obligations under the Indenture to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the Guarantees, (b) any
Indebtedness, letters of credit and commitments in respect of Indebtedness (in each case, other than
Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (3) of this paragraph) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
outstanding on the Issue Date, and the guarantees of and security granted with respect thereto,
(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or clause
(5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and (d) Management
Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (i) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or is merged, consolidated,
amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of
related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to each of clause (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that at
the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Issuer would have been permitted to Incur £1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the
relevant acquisition and Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less than it was immediately prior
to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging Agreements
entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for
speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or Senior Management of the
Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations, and in each
case any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which,
when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause
(7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of (A) £25.0 million and
(B) 25 per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees or
other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary
course of business, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or
obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business;
_provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or similar instruments, the obligations are_
reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary
course of business; and (d) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off
arrangements in the ordinary course of business;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations in
respect of earn-outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case,

181

(10)


Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or
any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring
or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or
disposition); provided that, in the case of a disposition, the maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair
market value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any
subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection
with such disposition;

(a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or
similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided,
_however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of Incurrence;_

(b) Customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business from customers
for goods purchased in the ordinary course of business;

(c) Indebtedness owed on a short-term basis of no longer than 30 days to banks and other financial
institutions incurred in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries with
such banks or financial institutions that arises in connection with ordinary banking arrangements to
manage cash balances of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(d) Indebtedness incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with bankers acceptances, discounted
bills of exchange or the discounting or factoring of receivables for credit management of bad debt
purposes, in each case incurred or undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arm’s length
commercial terms on a recourse basis; and

(e) Indebtedness in connection with Sale/Leaseback Transactions in the ordinary course of business.


(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the aggregate principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of £50.0 million and
50 per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA;

(12) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this clause (12) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100 per cent. of the Net Cash Proceeds
received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, an
Excluded Contribution or the Equity Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than
through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, an Excluded Contribution or the
Equity Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that
(i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making
Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6), (10), (13) and (14) of the third paragraph
of the covenant described below under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so
received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(12) to the extent the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph and clauses (1), (6), (10), (13) and (14) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;

(13) Indebtedness under daylight borrowing facilities incurred in connection with Transactions or any

repaid within three days of the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred;

(14) Indebtedness consisting of local lines of credit, bilateral facilities, working capital facilities and/or other

financings, inventory financings or similar arrangements, including by a Receivables Subsidiary in a
Qualified Receivables Financing, that is either (i) not recourse to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
other than a Receivables Subsidiary (except to the extent customary for such type of factoring or similar
arrangements and for Standard Securitization Undertakings) or (ii) does not exceed the greater of
(x) £10.0 million and (y) 10 per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA.

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with this covenant:

(a) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in
the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from
time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of
such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(b) all Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement whenever Incurred shall be deemed to have been
incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and not the first
paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant, and any such
Indebtedness may not be reclassified pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph;

(c) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of Bank Products, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(d) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (4), (5), (7), (11), or
(14) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not
be included;

(e) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase
price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(f) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(g) the amount of Indebtedness shall be calculated as described under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change of IFRS to UK GAAP, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or, at the option of the Issuer, in a manner consistent
with that contemplated by the second paragraph of the definition of “Consolidated Leverage”; provided that (a) if
such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums (including
tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, costs, taxes, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection
therewith; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on
the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and
(c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in
which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of
such Indebtedness, if denominated in sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made
under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the Sterling
Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency
Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result

183


-----

of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**Limitation on Layering**

The Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor shall, Incur any Indebtedness that is or purports to
be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) subordinated in right of payment
to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is pari passu with the Guarantee of such
Guarantor or is by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) made subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee
of such Guarantor; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to distinctions between categories of
Senior Indebtedness that exist by reason of (a) any Liens or guarantees arising or created in respect of some but
not all such Senior Indebtedness or (b) being secured on a ‘second in time’ or junior priority basis; provided,
further, that Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities that is Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor may provide for
an ordering of payments among the tranches of such Credit Facility.

**Limitation on Restricted Payments**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any Restricted
Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation
involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or in
Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any such
Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its Capital Stock other than
the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis, measured by value);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any direct or
indirect Parent Holding Company held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer (other than in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for
value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any
Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance
or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal
installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (other than by capitalization of interest) on or with respect to, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Shareholder Funding; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person;

(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) are referred to herein as a “Restricted
_Payment”), if at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:_

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph under the
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted
Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made subsequent to the
Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5),
(6), (10), (11), (12) and (17) of the second succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted
Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50 per cent. of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from the first
day of the first fiscal quarter commencing on or after the Issue Date to the end of the most recent fiscal

statements of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are available (or, in the case such Consolidated
Net Income is a deficit, minus 100 per cent. of such deficit;

(ii) 100 per cent. of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received

Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding subsequent to the Issue Date or otherwise
contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of the Issuer subsequent to the Issue Date (other than (v) Net Cash Proceeds or

Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the
Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date of
any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the
amount of any cash, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding
paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange);

(iv) the amount of the cash and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding
paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary by means of:

stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the
benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital
Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; and

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued, in each case, as
provided in the definition of “Investment”) not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under this clause (v)(B), was
included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments referred to in the first sentence of
this clause (c);

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the_
preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included under this clause (v).

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, if any Investment or Restricted Payment (or a
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses
(1) to (17) above and/or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or constitutes a
Permitted Investment, the Issuer may divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment (or, in each
case, a portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant on the date of its payment and may later
divide and reclassify any such Investment or Restricted Payment so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment
(as so divided and/or reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance on the applicable exception under
this covenant as of the date of such reclassification.

**Limitation on Liens**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or
profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, (x) in the case of Liens securing Senior
Indebtedness, on a basis junior to such Senior Indebtedness; (y) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated
Indebtedness, on a basis senior to such Subordinated Indebtedness; or (z) in the case of Pari Passu Indebtedness,
equally and ratably with, such Indebtedness for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of
any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

**Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility or (b) any other agreement or instrument,
in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by
or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was
designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined
with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the
Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such
Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such
Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
this second paragraph (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in this second paragraph; provided, however, that the
encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement
or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such
refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that
is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or
other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or
securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the
extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations, Capitalized Lease Obligations or
any other lease (or similar) permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture
agreement (or similar) that imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

189


-----

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all
or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that
are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any license, permit (or similar) or any regulatory or supervisory
authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or landlords
under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or Commodity
Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement
or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the holders than (i) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, together with the
Security Documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) or where the Issuer determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred
that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability
to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens;” or

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing or similar arrangement (including
any financing of a type permitted to be incurred pursuant to Clause (15) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness”) that, in the good faith determination of the Board
of Directors of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing or
similar arrangement.

**Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, of
the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75 per cent. of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash
Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100 per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied (directly
or indirectly) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the
terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or
Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within
475 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any revolving

190


-----

Indebtedness including, but not limited to, the revolving credit facility made available under any Credit
Facility) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or
purchased; or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than
100 per cent. of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase; provided that the Issuer shall redeem, repay or
repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Issuer (at
such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) (1) reduces obligations under the Notes
through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be
below par) and/or (2) redeems Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” and/or (3) makes an
offer to the holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth
below for an Asset Disposition Offer and/or (4) a combination of any one or more of (1), (2) and/or (3),
in an aggregate principal amount of Notes which together is at least equal to the proportion that (x) the
total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the total aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness (and any offer made to holders of the Notes shall be deemed to be an Asset
Disposition Offer made in compliance and for the purposes hereof); or

(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 475 days
from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;
_provided, however, that any such investment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding_
agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or
approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated
within 180 days of such 475th day,

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or_
clause (b) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise
invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or
invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the
Indenture. On the 476th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds £20.0 million and has not been committed in
accordance with clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant (or, if so committed, has not been applied or
invested within 180 days of such 475 day period), the Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition
_Offer”) to all holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of_
other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and
any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari
Passu Indebtedness, at an offer price of no more than) 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes and
100 per cent. of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the Notes,
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may
use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal
amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of
the Notes is denominated in a currency other than sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in sterling that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such
portion into sterling.

191


-----

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Issuer will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent they
elect, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer
_Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari_
Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
_pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness_
or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions
thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after
termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering holder of Notes an amount
equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such holder, and
accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note),
and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will
authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such holder, in an
aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such
new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000.

Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the
holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from
the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after
the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of
£25.0 million and 25 per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any

192


-----

service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of
£3.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £15.0 million, the terms of
such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments described in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other payments,
awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or
maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements to purchase
Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Holding Company restricted stock
plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee
benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance,
retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of
officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case
in the ordinary course of business, and any transaction or arrangement pursuant to or in connection with any
management or employee equity, compensatory or incentive scheme, deferred compensation, bonus or
similar arrangement;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any
Parent Holding Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or
controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any Transaction Document or transaction arising out of, and any payments
pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date (or,
in the case of any person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, any arrangements of that
person in place at the date on which it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary), as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, replaced, renewed or refinanced from time
to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the
holders in any material respect, and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing
agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and maintenance
of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary
course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in
the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management of the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained
at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction
solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

193


-----

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of
the Issuer or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of
such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer in their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction
with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the
Indenture;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) hereof, (a) payments by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any
Parent Holding Company) of annual customary management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and
related expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed, in each 12 month period that has commenced since
the Issue Date, beginning on the Issue Date, the greater of £3.0 million and 3.0 per cent. of Consolidated
EBITDA for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such
determination, (b) customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Holding Company) for financial advisory,
consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking
activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this clause
(b) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith and (c) payment of (or
indemnification in respect of) taxes and out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with the provision of financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or in
respect of other investment banking activities;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted
Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

arrangement (including any financing of a type permitted to be incurred pursuant to Clause (15) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(14) any transaction or arrangement in connection with the Transactions as described in the Offering
Memorandum or a Permitted Reorganization; and

(15) transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, so long as such transaction is with all holders of such class of Indebtedness (and
there are such non-Affiliate holders) and such Affiliates are treated no more favorably than all other holders
of such class generally.

**Reports**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue
Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Issuer or its predecessor as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer or its predecessor for the two most
recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the
independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of
a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
and capital resources of the Issuer, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical
accounting policies, with a similar scope to that included in this Offering Memorandum; (d) a description of
the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description
of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of
material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters of the Issuer beginning with the quarter
ending after the Issue Date, all quarterly reports of the Issuer containing the following information: (a) an
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as of the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent quarter year-to-date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period of the Issuer or
its predecessor, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement

194


-----

information and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together
with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the relevant quarter; (c) a year-to-date operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and
material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer, and a discussion of material changes not in
the ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report; and
(d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer or any other material event that
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of such
event.

All financial statements and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in
effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on
a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and
(3) above may, (x) in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to
such periods and (y) to the extent comparable prior period financial information of the Issuer does not exist, the
comparable prior period financial information of Cognita Bondco Parent Limited may be provided in lieu
thereof. Except as provided for in this covenant, no report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Issuer. The filing by the Issuer of an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the time period
specified in (1) will satisfy such provision. At the Issuer’s election it may also include financial statements of
Lernen Bidco Limited in lieu of those for the Issuer; provided that in such case a reasonably detailed description
of material differences between the financial statements of the Issuer, on one hand, and Lernen Bidco Limited (as
the case may be), on the other, shall be included for any period after the Issue Date (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, a statement of the Issuer’s total debt, cash and interest expense on a consolidated basis).

Following an Initial Public Offering on the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any parent thereof and/or the listing of
such Capital Stock on a recognized European stock exchange, the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2) and
(3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of
such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited
reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the
following items: turnover, net sales, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders equity,
capital expenditures and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall also (a) use its
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on such website as may be then
maintained by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of
such reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer determines in good faith
that it cannot make such reports or statement available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing
to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports or statement to the
holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes.

The Issuer may also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph
of this covenant if and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Exchange so require.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not subject
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall
furnish to the holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its
assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United Kingdom or the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (in
each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) (a) by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Issuer, under the Notes or the Notes Guarantee and (b) all obligations of the Issuer, under
the Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur
at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer comply with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to
such consolidation, merger or transfer have been satisfied and that the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer
enforceable in accordance with their terms. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such
Officer’s Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, as the case may be, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clauses (1)(b) and (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a Restricted Subsidiary that
becomes a parent of one or more of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under such Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—Subsidiary
_Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and, other than with respect to the_
third preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
the Issuer (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or
part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary and (c) the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer
may undertake the Transactions and a Permitted Reorganization. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2),
(3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or
otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the
Issuer.

-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant) will
not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

**_Subsidiary Guarantors_**

No Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (a “Subsidiary Guarantor”) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a Guarantor
concurrently with the transaction); or

(B)

(1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
expressly assumes (in each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security
Principles) all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Security
Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement); and

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of
the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3)(B)(2) and the provisions described above under “—The Issuer” (which
does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor,
(b) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor and (c) the Subsidiary Guarantors may undertake the
Transactions and a Permitted Reorganization. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3)(B)(2) (which does not
apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile
of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of the Subsidiary Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Limited Condition Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, or compliance with any provision
of the Indenture, including in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment,
incurrence, issuance, payment or other similar transaction, and any action, activity or transaction related thereto
where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of
Incurrence and repayment of Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of
determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be
the date the definitive agreements or commitments for such transaction, action or activity or arrangement are
entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, incurrence, issuance, payment or other similar
transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith as if they occur at the beginning
of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction
(and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if
any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to
fluctuations in EBITDA of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or the target company or any of its

197


-----

subsidiaries) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations
solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios
shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that
if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such
transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to
have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of
calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the
consummation of such transaction.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions
will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Notes Guarantees,”_
“—Lines of Business,” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will
cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants any
related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension
Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants and any related default provisions will not, however, be of any effect
with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of
such Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment
made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the
continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” or one of the clauses set
forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be
Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the
Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date); provided, that all Indebtedness outstanding on the
Reversion Date under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall be deemed Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (up to the maximum amount
of such Indebtedness Incurred prior to a Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent
such Indebtedness (including for the avoidance of doubt Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities
Agreement) would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described
under “— Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant
have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set
forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify holders of such event.

**Additional Notes Guarantees**

To the extent legally permissible and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles,
the Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors or the Issuer, directly
or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or other Indebtedness that is
Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”) or any Public Debt and any refinancing thereof or any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or a_
Guarantor exceeding £10.0 million in principal amount, in whole or in part, unless, in each case, such Restricted
Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on or as soon as commercially practicable after the date on which such other
Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the
form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee,
which Notes Guarantee will be subordinated to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of
such other Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee
a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Notes Guarantee.

Each additional Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial

198


-----

assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee
the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee could
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or regulation; (2) any
liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any
measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Notes Guarantee, which in
any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably
available to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) any inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement or
the Agreed Security Principles.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would
have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that
the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens (or the confirmation, affirmation or extension of security interests in
respect of the Collateral in connection with Permitted Collateral Liens ) shall under no circumstances be deemed
to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the
holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Security Documents, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation
_on Liens;” provided, that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral_
that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and
the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien in
accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
pursuant to the incurrence of any Permitted Collateral Lien or Permitted Lien or any action expressly permitted
by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the
foregoing, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral
Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto that is contemplated by the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or does not adversely affect the holders in
any material respect (as determined by the Issuer in good faith); provided, however, that, (except where permitted
by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate
the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial
Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, supplement, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of
Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or
replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of
Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise

199


-----

subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
actions without the need for instructions from the holders.

**Limitation on Issuer Activities**

The Issuer shall not trade or carry on any material business, own any material assets or Incur any material
Indebtedness except for a Permitted Holding Company Activity.

**Lines of Business**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Similar
Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the holders or by the holders of
30 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of the Issuer’s obligations
under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above or under the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants” above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an
Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice by the
Trustee on behalf of the holders or by the holders of 30 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”);_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates £20.0 million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of £20.0 million (exclusive
of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not
paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final and due (the “judgment
_default provision”);_

200


-----

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of
£20.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than
the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or amendment of any such
security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Security
Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the
Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(9) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable
in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Notes
Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the holders of 30 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer
of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7), the Issuer does not cure such default within the
time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing of
which a responsible office of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the holders of
at least 30 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the
Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon
such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if
any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an
Event of Default described in clause (5) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering
such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and
(2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured
or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing of which a responsible office of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be under no obligation
to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless
such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory
to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or
interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

201


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the
event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or
security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or
not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default or Event of
Default to the holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default or Event
of Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding
notice is in the interests of the holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the
occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults,
their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not
be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances
the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
holders to take action directly.

holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes); provided
that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, waive or modify or affect one series of the
Notes, only the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series
shall be required. However, without the consent of holders holding not less than 90 per cent. of the then
outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected, or if any amendment, waiver or other modification
will only amend, waive or modify one series of the Notes, without the consent of holders holding not less than
90 per cent. of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series amended, waived or
modified, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Notes held by a nonconsenting holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption;”

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any holder to institute suit for the payment of principal or interest on or with
respect to such holder’s Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a

202


-----

way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay
Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release (i) the security interest granted for the benefit of the holders over all or substantially all of the
Collateral or (ii) any Notes Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security
Document or the Indenture, as applicable, except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other parties
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision of any Note Documents
to this “Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under any
Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner
such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional
Notes;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the Covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for_
the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any
Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing
the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;
or

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement, in any property which is
required by the Senior Facilities Agreement to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security
interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by
the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is
complied with.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and if applicable, the Security Agent, shall be entitled to
rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate including an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel.

For purposes of determining whether holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Notes of a series
have consented to take any action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of any series of Notes will
be deemed to be the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes as of (i) such date (if a
record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action) or (ii) the date the taking of such action by
holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Notes has been certified to the Trustee by the Issuer
(if no such record date has been set).

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed

203


-----

amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Acts by holders**

In determining whether the holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have concurred in
any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and
deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under Notes of a series and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes of such series, registration of Notes of such series, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes of such series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents
in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants— Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer” and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—_
_Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and default provisions relating_
to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and its
Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision or
the security default provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to a series of
Notes, payment of such Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes.
If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Notes, payment of such Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses
(1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer” and
the covenant described under “— Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4),
(5), (6), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option with respect to a series of Notes, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit
in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof
for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case
may be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as
of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited
with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit
that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption.

In addition, the Issuer must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that the beneficial owners of such Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the
case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance
of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

204


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either
defeasance option.

The Issuer shall set forth the applicable currency or currencies which shall apply under this “—Defeasance”
provision in the Officer’s Certificate to be delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Additional Notes”.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the holders under the Security Document will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for
this purpose), cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (or,
in the case of a series of Notes issued in a currency other than euro, cash or government obligations in such other
currency), as applicable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of
deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as
the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the
Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions under the Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment
of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under
the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to
matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

The Issuer shall set forth the applicable currency or currencies which shall apply under this “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” provision in the Officer’s Certificate to be delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Additional_
_Notes”._

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries under the Note
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that,
except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written
notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to

205


-----

the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated
within 60 days (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may
remove the Trustee, or any holder who has been a bona fide holder for not less than six months may petition any
court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to holders of Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register
of the holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to holders of the Notes will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream,
each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. For the Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices
may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled
account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. Any notice or communication mailed to a holder shall
be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail, cause to be delivered or send a notice or
communication to a holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other holders. If a
notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for the payment
of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or
in connection with the Notes and the relevant Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or
otherwise by any holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the
sterling amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on
the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the
Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a
joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the holder of a Note or the Trustee to
certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it
Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action,
will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or
proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Notes Guarantee or to the Trustee.

**Maintenance of Listing**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the
Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not

206


-----

maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such
Notes on another “recognized stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the
United Kingdom.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since, as of the Issue Date, substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are held by Subsidiaries
located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor,
including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if
any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, may not
be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction
of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States.

will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or such acquisition or (3) of a Person at the time such Person merges with or

are the subject of such Asset Disposition shall be deemed an investment in Additional Assets);

(2) the Capital Stock of a Person that is engaged in a Similar Business and becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a

“controlling” and “controlled” have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

Indebtedness which is refinanced may be applied); provided that, where applicable, any amount of Indebtedness
may be stated so as to take into account the hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in respect of or

business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business or site (any such disposition, a
“Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is such a
Sale, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated
EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period or
increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable thereto for such period;
_provided that if any such sale constitutes “discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated_
Net Income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if positive) attributable to
such operations for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if
negative) attributable thereto for such period;

such Investment or acquisition, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a
transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be

calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto, including anticipated synergies and cost savings as if such
Purchase occurred on the first day of such period; and
(3) since the beginning of such period, any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or
otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period)
will have made any Sale or any Purchase that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (1) or
(2) above if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period, Consolidated
EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto, including anticipated
synergies and cost savings as if such Sale or Purchase occurred on the first day of such period.
For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Financial Interest
Expense, Consolidated Leverage, Consolidated Income Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated Net
Income and Priority Leverage Ratio, (a) calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible
accounting or financial officer of the Issuer (including in respect of cost savings and synergies) as though the full
effect of synergies and cost savings were realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the
reasonably anticipated full run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible accounting or
financial officer of the Issuer) of cost savings programs and synergies that have been initiated or approved by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries as though such cost savings programs and synergies had been fully
implemented on the first day of the relevant period and (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence, repayment,
repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if such transaction had
occurred on the first day of the relevant period.

the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” as well as clause (3) of the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”

period will be included in such Consolidated Net Income up to the aggregate amount of cash or Cash
Equivalents actually distributed by such Person during such period to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
as a dividend or other distribution or return on investment or that could have been distributed, as reasonably
determined by an Officer of the Issuer (subject, in the case of a dividend or other distribution or return on
investment to a Restricted Subsidiary, to the limitations contained in clause (2) below);

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

_Certain defined terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture,_
_as described in “Description of the Notes.”_

Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) in reliance on Rule 144A will be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). Notes sold to persons outside the
United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”)
in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
_Notes”)._

The Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”)
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary. The Global Notes will not be eligible for
clearance with The Depository Trust Company.

Ownership of beneficial interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants or otherwise, and will be required to be
effected in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Notes, the Indenture and in any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

The Book-Entry Interests will be held by Euroclear and Clearstream on behalf of their participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-Entry
Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry
form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Except under the limited circumstances described
below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”). The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of Notes take physical possession of such Notes in definitive
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer, pledge or grant any other security
interest in Book-Entry Interests.

So long as the Global Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners
or “holders” of Global Notes for any purpose. So long as the Global Notes are held in global form, the common
depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or its respective nominee, will be considered the sole holder of
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests in or to
exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture. You can find information about certain other restrictions on
the transferability of the Notes under “—Definitive Registered Notes.”

Neither we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, nor any of our or their respective
agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names,
will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered
owners or holders thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will
treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its
nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent and any of their respective agents
have and will not have any responsibility or liability:

(1) for any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to
Book-Entry Interests, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the records of Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to Book-Entry Interests, or for payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to Book-Entry Interests; or

(2) for Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

238


-----

The Notes will be in registered form and will initially be issued in denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and will only be transferable in minimum principal amounts of €100,000
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require
physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures
set out in the Indenture.

The Global Note for Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer
_Restrictions’” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and_
certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions’” and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes only
in the following circumstances:

(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either Euroclear
or Clearstream following an Event of Default which results in action by the Trustee pursuant to the
enforcement provisions under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately
preceding clause (2), its current procedure is to request that Definitive Registered Notes be issued to all owners
of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.

In any such events described in clause (1) or (2), the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in
the name or names of the holder(s) and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and
certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial
ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The Definitive Registered Note will bear a restrictive legend with respect
to certain transfer restrictions, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or by applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee
in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the

239


-----

holder, as applicable in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed, provided that a
Definitive Registered Notes will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent
appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our
requirements are met. We, the Trustee or the Registrar may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee, the
Registrar and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture
from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for
expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, we in
our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with
the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification
_(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions_
applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable
at the office of the Paying Agent.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be
entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, holders of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their
respective nominees, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them in respect of the Global Note so
redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption
of such Global Note. The aggregate price payable to the holders of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the
amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note, or any portion thereof. We understand that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream,
if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on
such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of €100,000
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest and
additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer in euros to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn,
make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or Clearstream. The common
depositary or its nominee will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with Euroclear and/
or Clearstream’s procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for
or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature
except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes’” If any
such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes’” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts_
received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding
will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global
Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction.

We expect that payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants will be
governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for

240


-----

the accounts of customers registered in “street name.” Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities
held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name.”

In order to tender Book-Entry Interests in a change of control offer or asset sale offer, the holder of the applicable
Global Note must, within the time period specified in such offer, give notice of such tender to the relevant agent
and specify the principal amount of Book-Entry Interests to be tendered.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
(including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of the participant to
whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion to
the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant has given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action
in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Indenture, each of Euroclear
and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the

Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to its participants, as described in the subsection “—Definitive Registered Notes.”

**Global Clearance, Settlement and Trading under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the
Transfer Agent or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear,
Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream holders
on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of
any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement
can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day,
may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Brussels if Euroclear is used,
or Luxembourg if Clearstream is used.

**Clearing Information**

The Notes have been accepted for clearance and settlement through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream.
The international securities identification numbers and common code numbers for the Notes are set out under
_“Listing and General Information.”_

241


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things,
services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and
securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain United Kingdom Tax Consequences**

The comments in this part are based on current United Kingdom tax law as applied in England and Wales and
HM Revenue & Customs practice (which may not be binding on HM Revenue & Customs). They do not
necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other person. They relate
only to the position of persons who hold their Notes as investments (regardless of whether the holder also carries
on a trade, profession or vocation through a permanent establishment, branch or agency to which the Notes are
attributable) and are the absolute beneficial owners thereof. Certain classes of persons such as dealers, certain
professional investors, or persons connected with the Issuer may be subject to special rules and this summary
does not apply to such Noteholders.

**Withholding**

While the Notes continue to be listed on a recognized stock exchange within the meaning of Section 1005
Income Tax Act 2007, payments of interest by the Issuer may be made without withholding or deduction for or
on account of United Kingdom income tax. The International Stock Exchange is a recognized stock exchange for
these purposes. Securities will be treated as listed on the Exchange when they are admitted to the Official List of
the Exchange.

If the Notes cease to be listed, interest which has a United Kingdom source will generally be paid by the Issuer
under deduction of income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent.) unless: (i) another relief applies under
domestic law; or (ii) the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HM Revenue & Customs in respect
of such relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

If interest were paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax (e.g. if the Notes lost their listing),
Noteholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if
there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty.

_Payments in Respect of the Guarantee_

The United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor under the terms of the Guarantee in
respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts
subscribed for the Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the
exemption from withholding on account of United Kingdom tax in respect of securities listed on a recognized
stock exchange described above in relation to payments of interest by the Issuer. Accordingly, if a Guarantor
makes any such payments and they have a United Kingdom source, these may be subject to United Kingdom
withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent).

_Treatment of any Premium Payable on Redemption_

Where Notes are to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium as opposed to being issued at a discount, then
any such element of premium may constitute a payment of interest that would be subject to the rules on United
Kingdom withholding tax outlined above.

**United Kingdom Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax**

No United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the issue or transfer by delivery of a
Note or on its redemption.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This summary deals only with initial purchasers of
Notes that acquire them in the Offering at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes
are sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and that will hold the
Notes as capital assets. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be
relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition,
ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including consequences under the alternative minimum
tax or net investment income tax), and does not address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws. This summary
also does not address tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as certain financial institutions, insurance companies,
individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organisations, dealers in securities or

243


-----

currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents
of the United States, investors holding the Notes in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the
United States, U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad or investors whose functional currency is
not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organised under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is
able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has elected to be treated as a domestic trust
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S
federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.

Under recently enacted legislation, U.S. Holders that maintain certain types of financial statements and use the
accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be required to include certain
amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on their financial statements. The
application of this rule may require U.S. Holders that maintain such financial statements to include certain
amounts realized in respect of the Notes in income earlier than would otherwise be the case under the general
rules described below, although the precise application of this rule is unclear at this time. This rule generally will
be effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 or, in respect of Notes treated as issued with
original issue discount, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2018. U.S. Holders that use the accrual
method of accounting should consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential applicability of this rule to
their particular situation.

The summary is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court
decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR
GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX
ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING
AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE,
LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.

**_Payments of Interest_**

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, interest on a Note (including any amounts withheld and any
Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on a payment on a Note) will be taxable to a
U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on such holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes constitutes income from
sources outside the United States.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest
payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted into U.S. dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest
payment denominated in a foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method,
the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual
period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period
within each taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of
the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two
taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual

244


-----

period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by
the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”).

Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the
sale or retirement of a Note) denominated in a foreign currency, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss ) equal to the difference
between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount
previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Sale and Retirement of the Notes_**

A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale or retirement of a Note equal to the difference
between the amount realised on the sale or retirement and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis of the Note, each as
determined in U.S. dollars. The amount realised does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income. U.S. Holders
should consult their tax advisors about to account for proceeds received on a sale or retirement of a Note that are
not paid in U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or
loss) on the sale or retirement of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S.
Holder’s purchase price for the Note (i) on the date of sale or retirement and (ii) the date on which the U.S.
Holder acquired the Note. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including any foreign currency
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realised only to the extent
of total gain or loss realised on the sale or retirement. Gain or loss (other than foreign currency exchange gain or
loss described above) realised by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Note will be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year.
Non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to tax on long-term capital gains at reduced rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. Gain or loss realised by a U.S. Holder on the sale or
retirement of a Note generally will be U.S. source.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

A U.S. taxpayer that participates in a “reportable transaction” will be required to disclose its participation to the
IRS. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the
Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the regulations (U.S.$50,000 in a
single taxable year, if the U.S. Holder is an individual or trust, or higher amounts for other non-individual U.S.
Holders), and to disclose its investment by filing Form 8886 with the IRS. A penalty in the amount of
U.S.$10,000 in the case of a natural person and U.S.$50,000 in all other cases generally is imposed on any
taxpayer that fails to timely file an information return with the IRS with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss
that is treated as a reportable transaction. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding
the application of these rules.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of sale or other disposition of Notes by a U.S. paying
agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under
applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an
accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable
certification requirements. Certain U.S. Holders are not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is
not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from a payment to a U.S. Holder under the backup withholding
rules will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the
U.S. Holder to a refund, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisers about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or
disposition of Notes, including requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial assets.

**Certain Singapore Tax Consequences**

The statements below are general in nature and are based on certain aspects of current tax laws in Singapore and
administrative guidelines and circulars issued by the Inland Revenue Authority (“IRAS”) of Singapore and the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) in force as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, and are subject
to any changes in such laws, administrative guidelines or circulars, or the interpretation of those laws, guidelines

245


-----

or circulars, occurring after such date, which could be made on a retroactive basis. These laws, guidelines and
circulars are also subject to various interpretations and the relevant tax authorities or the courts could later
disagree with the explanations or conclusions set out below. Neither these statements nor any other statements in
this Offering Memorandum are intended or are to be regarded as advice on the tax position of any holder of the
Notes or of any person acquiring, selling or otherwise dealing with the Notes or on any tax implications arising
from the acquisition, sale or other dealings in respect of the Notes. The statements below do not purport to be a
comprehensive or exhaustive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to
subscribe for, purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and do not purport to deal with the tax consequences
applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or financial institutions in
Singapore which have been granted the relevant Financial Sector Incentive(s)) may be subject to special rules or
tax rates. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to consult their own professional tax advisers as to the
Singapore or other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposal of the Notes, including, in
particular, the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws to which they are subject. It is emphasised that none of
the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Joint Global Coordinators or any other persons involved in the issuance of the
Notes accepts responsibility for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from the subscription for, purchase, holding
or disposal of the Notes.

**_Interest and Other Payments_**

Subject to the following paragraphs, under Section 12(6) of the Income Tax Act, Cap. 134 of Singapore (the
“Income Tax Act”), the following payments are deemed to be derived from Singapore:

(a) any interest, commission, fee or any other payment in connection with any loan or indebtedness or with any
arrangement, management, guarantee, or service relating to any loan or indebtedness which is (i) borne,
directly or indirectly, by a person resident in Singapore or a permanent establishment in Singapore (except
in respect of any business carried on outside Singapore through a permanent establishment outside
Singapore or any immovable property situated outside Singapore) or (ii) deductible against any income
accruing in or derived from Singapore; or

(b) any income derived from loans where the funds provided by such loans are brought into or used in
Singapore.

Such payments, where made to a person not known to the paying party to be a resident in Singapore for tax
purposes, are generally subject to withholding tax in Singapore. The rate at which tax is to be withheld for such
payments (other than those subject to the 15 per cent. final withholding tax described below) to non-resident
persons (other than non-resident individuals) is currently 17 per cent. The applicable rate for non-resident
individuals is currently 22 per cent. However, if the payment is derived by a person not resident in Singapore
from sources other than from its trade, business, profession or vocation carried on or exercised by such person in
Singapore and is not effectively connected with any permanent establishment in Singapore of that person, the
payment is subject to a final withholding tax of 15 per cent. The rate of 15 per cent. may be reduced by
applicable tax treaties.

However, certain Singapore-sourced investment income derived by individuals from financial instruments is
exempt from tax, including:

(a) interest from debt securities derived on or after 1 January 2004;

(b) discount income (not including discount income arising from secondary trading) from debt securities
derived on or after 17 February 2006; and

(c) prepayment fee, redemption premium and break cost from debt securities derived on or after 15 February
2007,

except where such income is derived through a partnership in Singapore or is derived from the carrying on of a
trade, business or profession in Singapore.

**_Capital Gains_**

Any gains considered to be in the nature of capital made from the sale of the Notes will not be taxable in
Singapore. However, any gains derived by any person from the sale of the Notes which are gains from any trade,
business, profession or vocation carried on by that person, if accruing in or derived from Singapore, may be
taxable as such gains are considered revenue in nature.

Holders of the Notes who apply or are required to apply Singapore Financial Reporting Standards 39 (“FRS 39”)
or 109 (“FRS 109”) may for Singapore income tax purposes be required to recognise gains or losses (not being

246


-----

gains or losses in the nature of capital) on the Notes, irrespective of disposal, in accordance with FRS 39 or FRS
109 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law). Please see the section below on
“Adoption of FRS 39 and FRS 109 Treatment for Singapore Income Tax Purposes.”

Adoption of FRS 39 and FRS 109 Treatment for Singapore Income Tax Purposes

Section 34A of the Income Tax Act provides for the tax treatment for financial instruments in accordance with
FRS 39 (subject to certain exceptions and “opt-out” provisions) to taxpayers who are required to comply with
FRS 39 for financial reporting purposes. The IRAS has also issued a circular entitled “Income Tax Implications
_Arising from the Adoption of FRS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.”_

FRS 109 is mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, replacing FRS 39.
Section 34AA of the Income Tax Act requires taxpayers who comply or who are required to comply with FRS
109 for financial reporting purposes to calculate their profit, loss or expense for Singapore income tax purposes
in respect of financial instruments in accordance with FRS 109, subject to certain exceptions. The IRAS has also
issued a circular entitled “Income Tax: Income Tax Treatment Arising from Adoption of FRS 109 – Financial
_Instruments.”_

Holders of the Notes who may be subject to the tax treatment under the Sections 34A or 34AA of the Income Tax
Act should consult their own tax advisers regarding the Singapore income tax consequences of their acquisition,
holding or disposal of the Notes.

**_Estate Duty_**

Singapore estate duty has been abolished with respect to all deaths occurring on or after 15 February 2008.

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (which entered into force on June 26, 2017 and applies to insolvency proceedings opened
on or after that date) recasting Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 (which continues to apply to any
insolvency proceedings opened before 26 June 2017), (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within
the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main
interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is
situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its
“centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (which entered into force on 26 June 2017 and applies to insolvency proceedings opened
on or after that date) recasting Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 (which continues to apply to any
insolvency proceedings opened before June 26, 2017), (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within
the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main
interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is
situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its
“centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the “centre of main interests” of a company is
presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary.
This presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the
3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, preamble 30 of the
EU Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s
central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties,
that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located
in that other Member State.” Prior to June 26, 2017, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors
in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company, including in particular where board meetings are
held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main interests” may
change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent
jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth
above) the registered office has been moved within the 3-month period prior to the filing of the insolvency
petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of
the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2)
of the EU Insolvency Regulation the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the
territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the
company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency
proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other
Member State.

248


-----

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet
been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has
an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which
the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency
proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the
operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial
proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory
of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings.

All Member States (other than Denmark) shall recognize any judgment opening insolvency proceedings handed
down by a court of a Member State which has jurisdiction to open such proceedings from the moment that it
becomes effective in the State of the opening of proceedings. The judgment opening main insolvency
proceedings shall, with no further formalities, produce the same effects in any other Member State as under the
law of the State of the opening of proceedings, unless the EU Insolvency Regulation provides otherwise and as
long as no secondary proceedings are opened in that other Member State. The insolvency practitioner appointed
by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of
main interests is there) may exercise all the powers conferred on it, by the law of the State of the opening of
proceedings, in another Member State, as long as no other insolvency proceedings have been opened there and no
preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings in that State. Subject to Articles 8 and 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency
practitioner may, in particular, remove the company’s assets from the territory of the Member State in which they
are situated.

**England and Wales**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors and providers of Collateral are incorporated in, maintain their respective
registered offices in and conduct their business and the administration of their interests on a regular basis in and
from England and Wales (each an “English Obligor”). On the basis of these factors, an English court may
conclude that the English Obligors have their “centre of main interests”, within the meaning of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, in England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England constituting “main
insolvency proceedings” under article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in respect of an
English Obligor.

The Insolvency Act 1986 as amended (the “IA86”) has no definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the
concept of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section
123 of the IA86, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others,
the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a
statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for
three weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; (ii) if it is proved
to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to
the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking
into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

**Overview of England & Wales Insolvency Proceedings**

_Liquidation_

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realized by the
liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see
“—Priority of Claims in an insolvency” below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has
completed this task, the company will be dissolved. There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory;
and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’
voluntary liquidation (“CVL”).

Regardless of how he is appointed, a liquidator owes his duties to the company and its creditors as a whole and
has wide powers to carry out his functions to conduct the liquidation. This includes the power to: (i) agree,
compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal
proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with section
178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside
certain transactions.

In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the
company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such

249


-----

automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, order a stay under
its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.

**_Compulsory liquidation_**

Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which any creditor, the directors, the company or
(in certain circumstances) a shareholder, any administrator or administrative receiver of the company, a regulator
or the relevant Secretary of State, petitions for the winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up
order. The grounds which entitle the court to make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the IA86.
Common grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts; and (ii) the court is of the opinion that it is
just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of shares, or alteration in
the status of the company’s members is void if made following the commencement of the winding up unless the
court orders otherwise. If a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced on the date on which the
winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect, meaning that the company cannot
enter into any of the specified transactions during the period between the presentation of a winding up petition
and the making of a winding up order without first seeking a validation order from the court.

**_Members’ voluntary liquidation_**

An MVL is a solvent liquidation that is initiated by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a
special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory
declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the
opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full, including interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a
stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

**_Creditors’ voluntary liquidation_**

A creditors’ voluntary liquidation is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into
liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory
declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). The directors must seek a
decision of the creditors to nominate a liquidator. If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator
from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail, unless the court determines otherwise.

_Priority of Claims in an insolvency_

Upon liquidation of any English Obligor, the order of priorities is such that debts due by it to any holders of fixed
charges over UK assets are paid first out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to such fixed charges
(subject to the prior payment of the costs of preservation and realization of the fixed charge assets). Where there
are floating charges, liquidation expenses (discussed further below), preferential creditors, and unsecured
creditors to the extent of the “ring-fenced” Prescribed Part (as defined below) are paid out of the proceeds of
realization of assets subject to those floating charges in priority to payments to creditors secured by virtue of
those floating charges. Thereafter, any debts owing to holders of the floating charges would be paid to the extent
they are secured by that charge. The categories of preferential debts include certain amounts payable in respect of
occupational pension schemes relating to contributions due but unpaid and employee remuneration up to a
specified amount. A certain part of the net proceeds of the realization of the assets covered by a floating charge
(up to a maximum of £600,000) would be “ring-fenced” and made available pro rata to unsecured creditors (the
“Prescribed Part”). Unsecured debts which are not preferential debts would be paid from the proceeds of
realizations of unsecured assets (if any) and, after the secured liabilities have been met, from the proceeds of
realization of relevant secured assets.

As discussed further below, certain of the security interests over UK assets expected to be created in favor of the
security agent will be expressed as fixed charges, but there is no certainty that the security will take effect as a
fixed charge and it may well take effect as a floating charge. Where no security is provided to secure the
obligations of an English Obligor, any principal debt or guarantee obligation of that English Obligor will be
unsecured.

**_Administration_**

Administration is a ‘rescue’ procedure under the IA86 for companies that are, or are likely to become, insolvent
pursuant to which a company may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory
moratorium. A company may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court
process.

250


-----

There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court following
by a court order for administration (the “in-court route”); or (ii) the filing of certain prescribed forms with the
court following which the administration takes effect (the “out-of-court route”). The in-court route is commenced
by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its creditors including
contingent or prospective creditors or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment
is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see
below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment
takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument
which either: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the
floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator of the company. A person is the holder
of a QFC if he holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security
which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which
is a qualifying floating charge.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or
out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its
debts. Administrations commenced on or after 15 September 2003 will have a single purpose, consisting of three
consecutive objectives: (i) to rescue the company (corporate survival); then (ii) if that is not reasonably
practicable, to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than on liquidation; then (iii) if neither are
reasonably practicable, to realize property for secured or preferential creditors (this objective may only be
followed if it does not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole). A company
may only go into administration if the administration purpose is likely to be achieved.

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the application for an
administration order is made, or the notice of intention to appoint an administrator out-of-court by notice is filed.
The moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process (including legal proceedings, execution,
distress or diligence) may be commenced or continued against the company and no step can be taken to enforce
security over the company’s property or any repossession rights under hire purchase, chattel leasing, conditional
sale or retention of title agreements (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission
of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed and, except in certain limited circumstances, no
resolution can be passed or order be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not apply to
financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial
Collateral Regulations”) (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as
shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments).

An administrator must exercise his functions to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, the
administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property
to which he thinks the company is entitled. He has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except
in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security. The permission of the court is required to dispose
of any such fixed charge assets and the proceeds of sale must be paid to the fixed charge holder. An
administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing
actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent
_Transaction Laws” in respect of the latter)._

**Antecedent Transaction Laws**

There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s
insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238);(ii)
preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding
creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the exception of
section 423 which applies even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings.

**Transactions at an undervalue**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the
court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a
transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration

251


-----

the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth)
of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the”relevant time” (2 years
before the onset of insolvency, which is, broadly, the start of the insolvency proceedings, being the
commencement of its liquidation or administration); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or
became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86
(although there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the
transaction if the transaction is made to a person connected to the company such as a shareholder or a director (a
“connected person”)).

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company
which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and
(ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.

**Preferences**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the
application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has
suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position
which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would
have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference
by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or
suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was
given within the relevant time (6 months ending with the onset of the insolvency or 2 years ending with the onset
of insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v) the company was at the time of the
transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of
the IA86.

**Voidable floating charges**

A floating charge created by a company over its property (which, as created, was a floating charge) may be
invalid if it was created in the relevant time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means in the
period of 2 years ending with the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within in the period of
12 months ending with the onset on insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became
as a consequence of the transaction under which the charge was created, unable to pay its debts within the
meaning of section 123 of the IA86.

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid
except to the extent of the aggregate of (i) the value of consideration consisting of money paid, goods or services
supplied, or debts reduced or discharged, at the same time as or after creation of the charge; and (ii) and interest
thereon. No court action is required.

Section 245 of the IA86 does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral
arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**Transactions defrauding creditors**

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above);
and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who may make a claim
against the company or otherwise prejudicing the interests of the creditor.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a
preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. The victim of the transaction can apply to the court
himself. The IA86 also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the
transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the claim. It will suffice that the
company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There
is no need to show that the debtor’s purpose was the sole purpose and a “real substantial purpose” is likely to
suffice.

**Extortionate credit transactions**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the
court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

252


-----

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its
terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in
respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company at any
time during the three year period ending with day on which the company entered into administration or went into
liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at
an undervalue and preferences).

**Order**

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has
very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before
the transaction was entered into.

**Maintenance of capital**

The granting of upstream (or cross-stream) guarantees or security by an English company could be subject to
challenge if it results in a reduction in that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent
that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

**Recharacterization of Fixed Security Interests**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to
them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed
security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured
party has the requisite degree of control over the English Obligor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the
proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the holder of the security, in practice. Where an
English Obligor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and
without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question
constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to
attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed
security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its
discretion and without the consent of the chargee.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured
creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the English Obligor’s net property which is ring
fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the
English Obligor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such
security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead
of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.

_Limitation on Enforcement_

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another
group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by
the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow
such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void
and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are
dealing with a English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of
entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act
in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor
for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient
commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be
vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

**Equitable Share Charge**

The fixed charges over shares granted by certain English Obligors are equitable charges, not legal charges. An
equitable charge arises where a chargor transfers the beneficial interest in the shares to the charge but retains
legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable remedies or are
otherwise at the discretion of the court.

253


-----

**Account Banks’ Right to Set-Off**

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an Account Charge) granted by a English Obligor over any
of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an Account Bank) may have
reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to
exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements
with that English Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather
than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account
Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge.
Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the
occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant UK Guarantor) the collateral will no longer
be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights, since the Account Bank will only be entitled
to exercise its netting and set-off rights whilst the bank accounts are subject only to floating security, except
where account banks have expressly reserved set-off rights.

**Foreign currency**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts, any
debt of a company payable in a currency other than Pound sterling must be converted into Pound sterling at the
“exchange rate” prevailing at the relevant date when the company went into liquidation or administration.

**Schemes of arrangement**

A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, which permits
a company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members or creditors (or any class of them). A
scheme of arrangement, if approved by the requisite majority of such members or creditors and sanctioned by the
court, will be binding on all of them, whether or not such members or creditors voted in favor of the scheme. The
scheme must be approved by a majority in number representing 75% in value of the creditors (or class of
creditors) present and voting at the relevant creditors’ meeting, either in person or by proxy.

**Singapore**

The Acceding Singapore Subsidiary Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of Singapore and will
be granting a guarantee and creating security interests as further described in “The Offering.” A company
incorporated in Singapore (the “Singapore Company”) must have the requisite capacity and power to grant a
guarantee and to create security interests pursuant to its constitutional documents. This includes ensuring that the
Singapore Company has taken all corporate action, including the passing of corporate resolutions required under
its constitutional documents, to authorize the execution by it of the guarantee or security documents and the
exercise by it of its rights and the performance by it of its obligations under such guarantee or security
documents.

_Stamp duty_

Under Singapore law, stamp duty of up to a maximum of S$500 is imposed by the Inland Revenue Authority of
Singapore in connection with the execution and delivery of any security documents which are stampable.

_Registration requirements_

It is necessary under the laws of Singapore in order to ensure the validity, effectiveness, performance and/or
enforceability of the security interests created by certain of the security documents registrable under Section 131
of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 of Singapore (the “Singapore Companies Act”) that the obligations created
thereunder be registered as a charge with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority in Singapore
within 30 days of such creation.

_General Considerations for Enforcement of Guarantee or Security_

The general impediments to enforcement of a guarantee or security in Singapore include the following
(a) bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization and other laws affecting the rights of the creditors,
including the appointment of a judicial manager over the company’s assets under Part VIIIA of the Singapore
Companies Act and the avoidance of vulnerable or fraudulent transactions; and (b) general principles of equity
which may dictate that equitable remedies may not always be given if for instance damages are adequate or there
are illegality or public policy reasons. Any insolvency proceedings applicable to Singapore incorporated
companies are likely to be governed by Singapore insolvency laws. If a scheme of arrangement or compromise is

254


-----

proposed pursuant to Section 210 of the Singapore Companies Act, the court may, subject to the laws governing
such schemes, on the application of the relevant Singapore Company or of any member or creditor of such
Singapore Company, restrain further proceedings in any action or proceeding against that Singapore Company
except by leave of the Court. If a judicial manager is appointed under Part VIIIA of the Singapore Companies
Act, all creditors of that Singapore Company would be prevented from enforcing any security over that
Singapore Company’s assets, except with the consent of the judicial manager or with leave of the Court and
(where the Court gives leave) subject to such terms as the Court may impose.

_Transactions at Undervalue or Unfair Preference or Fraudulent Transactions_

The guarantee and/or the security given by a Singapore Company might be subject to challenges by a liquidator
or a judicial manager under Singapore laws relating to transactions at an undervalue or preferential transactions.

On the application of a liquidator or judicial manager, the Singapore courts may make such an order as they think
fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the Singapore Company subject to the application had
not entered into, inter alia, any of the following types of transactions:

(a) a transaction with any person at an undervalue which took place at any time within the period of five years
ending on the date of the commencement of the winding up. Where the transaction was entered into with a
person who is a person associated with the Singapore Company (otherwise than by reason only of being its
employee), the requirement that the Singapore Company was insolvent at the time of the transaction or became
insolvent as a result of the transaction shall be presumed to be satisfied unless the contrary is shown;

(b) a transaction under which an unfair preference is given by the Singapore Company to a person who is a
person associated with the Singapore Company (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee), and which
is not a transaction at an undervalue, at any time within the period of two years ending on the date of the
commencement of the winding up; or

(c) in any other case of a transaction under which an unfair preference is given by the Singapore Company, and
which is not a transaction at an undervalue, at any time within the period of six months ending on the date of the
commencement of the winding up, provided that the Singapore Company was insolvent when it entered into the
transaction or became insolvent as a result of the transaction.

A Singapore Company will be treated as having entered into a transaction with a person at an undervalue if:

(A) it enters into a transaction with that person on terms that provide for it to receive no consideration; or

(B) it enters into a transaction with that person for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s
worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by the
Singapore Company.

The Singapore courts will not make any order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the
Singapore Company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and that,
at the time it entered into the transaction, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would
be of benefit to the Singapore Company.

The Singapore Company will be treated as having given an unfair preference to another person if:

(i) that person is a creditor of the Singapore Company or a surety provider or guarantor for a debt or other
liability of the Singapore Company; and

(ii) the Singapore Company does anything or suffers anything to be done that (in either case) has the effect of
putting the person into a position which, in the event of the winding up of the Singapore Company, will be better
than the position such person would have been in if that thing had not been done.

The Singapore courts will not make an order in respect of an unfair preference given to any person unless the
Singapore Company, when giving the unfair preference, was influenced in deciding to give the unfair preference
by a desire to produce in relation to that person the effect referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) above. If the Singapore
Company gave an unfair preference to a person who was, at the time the unfair preference was given, a person
associated with the Singapore Company (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee), the Singapore
Company shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to have been influenced in deciding to give the unfair
preference by the desire referred to above.

In addition, section 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, Chapter 61 of Singapore applies in
respect of transactions to defraud creditors. Any transaction that is impugned pursuant to this section, upon proof
of the intention to defraud creditors, is voidable at the instance of a person who has been prejudiced by such
transaction. This provision applies to “every conveyance of property,” and not only to transactions at an
undervalue.

255


-----

_Difference in insolvency law_

Any insolvency proceedings commenced in the Singapore courts with respect to a Singapore Company should be
governed by Singapore insolvency laws. Singapore insolvency laws differ from the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, including the State of New York. Singapore has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on CrossBorder Insolvency (with certain modifications to adapt it for application in Singapore).

_Priority of secured creditors and guarantees_

Singapore insolvency laws generally recognize the priority of secured creditors over unsecured creditors. A
guarantee is a contractual undertaking and does not confer any priority in the event of insolvency.

_Preferential creditors_

Under Section 328 of the Singapore Companies Act, in a winding-up of a Singapore Company, preferential debts
are required to be paid in priority to all other debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Certain
preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge (those listed in paragraphs (a) to
(c) and (e) to (f) below) if the assets of the chargor company are insufficient to satisfy such preferential debts.

The preferential debts covered by Section 328 of the Singapore Companies Act are described briefly below:

(a) costs and expenses of the winding up;

(b) employees’ wages and salaries;

(c) retrenchment benefits under employment contracts;

(d) work injury compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act, Chapter 354 of Singapore;

(e) certain amounts due under employees’ superannuation or provident funds or under any scheme of
superannuation which is an approved scheme under Singapore income tax laws;

(f) remuneration payable in respect of employees’ vacation leave; and

(g) taxes assessed and goods and services tax.

_Disclaimer of onerous contracts_

Section 332 of the Singapore Companies Act provides that where any property of a company consists of either an
estate or interest in land that is burdened with onerous covenants, shares in corporations, unprofitable contracts or
any other property that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by reason of its binding the company to the
performance of any onerous act or payment of any sum, the liquidator may apply to disclaim such property
within twelve months of (i) commencement of winding-up or, (ii) where any such property has not come to the
knowledge of the liquidator within one month after the commencement of winding-up, such powers of
disclaiming may be exercised at any time within twelve months after the liquidator has become aware of such
property or such extended period as is allowed by the court.

_Extortionate Credit Transactions_

Extortionate credit transactions may be set aside or varied if they are entered into within a period of three years
before the commencement of winding up or judicial management of the company. Credit transactions are
extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the creditor, either the terms are such as to require grossly
exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision
of the credit or it is harsh and unconscionable or substantially unfair. In determining whether such a transaction
ought to be set aside, the Court will consider, among other things, whether the transaction was oppressive and
reflective of an imbalance in bargaining power of which the creditor took improper advantage.

_Floating Charges_

A floating charge created within six months of the commencement of the winding up of a company shall, unless
it is proved that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge, be invalid except to the
amount of any cash paid to the company at the time of or subsequently to the creation of and in consideration for
the charge together with any prescribed rate of interest on that amount as may be applicable under the Companies
Act (Cap. 50) of Singapore.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated as of the
date of the final Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the several Initial Purchasers, and the
several Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers are subject to certain conditions
precedent such as the receipt by the Initial Purchasers of officers’ certificates and legal opinions and approval of
certain legal matters by its counsel. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all
of the Notes if any of them are purchased. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have
agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers and their controlling persons jointly and severally
against certain liabilities in connection with this Offering, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and
to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to resell the Notes (a) to QIBs in reliance on the
exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A and (b) outside
the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Following the closing of the
Offering, the indenture will permit transfers of Notes to “accredited investors” (as defined in Regulation D of the
U.S. Securities Act), among others, subject to compliance with applicable law.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum. After the initial Offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may
be changed at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of
their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to
withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for its services in connection with the
Offering and to reimburse it for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

**Transfer Restrictions and Liquidity**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or qualified for sale under the
securities laws of any U.S. state or any jurisdiction outside the United States and may not be offered or sold
within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S. Accordingly, the Notes will be subject to significant restrictions on resale and transfer as described
under “Notice to Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.” Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in
reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the U.S. Exchange Act.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We will apply, through the
Listing Agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the
Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us
that, following the completion of this Offering, they currently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted
by applicable laws and regulations. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so, and the Initial
Purchasers may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the Notes at any time in its sole
discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be
liquid and that you will be able to sell any of the Notes held by you at a particular time or that the prices that you
receive when you sell will be favourable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees
_and Our Structure—There may not be an active market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_
_may be limited.” Each purchaser of the Notes, by its purchase of the Notes, will be deemed to have made certain_
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors.”

The Initial Purchasers have represented, warranted and agreed that it:

(a) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section
21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the
issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the
Issuer; and

257


-----

(b) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly
or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where
such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of
this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or
disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors
of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Issuer has agreed that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers, during the period
beginning from the date of the final Offering Memorandum and continuing until the date that is 60 days after the
date of the final Offering Memorandum, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities of,
or guaranteed by, the Issuer or the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries that are substantially similar
to the Notes.

**Stabilization**

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that certain persons participating in the Offering may engage in
transactions, including over-allotment, stabilizing bids, syndicate covering transactions or the imposition of
penalty bids, which may have the effect of stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the Notes at a level
above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. A short position is more likely to be
created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the
Temporary Notes and Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase
in the offering. A stabilizing bid is a bid for the purchase of Notes on behalf of the Initial Purchasers for the
purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. A syndicate covering transaction is the bid for
or the purchase of Notes on behalf of the Initial Purchasers to reduce a short position incurred by the Initial
Purchasers in connection with the Offering. A penalty bid is an arrangement permitting the Initial Purchasers to
reclaim the selling concession otherwise accruing to a syndicate member in connection with the Offering if the
Notes originally sold by such syndicate member are purchased in a syndicate covering transaction and therefore
have not been effectively placed by such syndicate member. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any
representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above
may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any
representation that these transactions will be engaged in or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
discontinued without notice. The Stabilizing Manager is not obligated to engage in these activities and, if
commenced, any of the activities may be discontinued at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees
_and Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_
_the Notes may be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after
the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they
must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

**Other Activities and Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers, including their affiliates, are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment

258


-----

management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers have, or
their affiliates have, from time to time, provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking,
financial advisory and commercial banking services to the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of
business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers
have, or their affiliates have, received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for the
transactions described in this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers and/or certain of their affiliates are
agents, mandated lead arranger(s) and lender(s) under the Revolving Credit Facility, and such entities may act as
counterparties in the hedging arrangements we expect to enter into in connection with the transactions described
in this Offering Memorandum, and have received or will receive customary fees for its/their services in such
capacities.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and
commissions for the Transactions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are lenders under the
Bridge Facilities, which are being repaid with the proceeds from the Offering, and lenders under the Senior
Facilities, and such entities may act as counterparties in the hedging arrangements we expect to enter into in
connection with the Transactions, and have received or will receive customary fees for their services in such
capacities.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer and its
affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the Issuer consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and such affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation
of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such
securities and instruments.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be Business Days (as such term is used for
purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in two Business Days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the
next succeeding Business Days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of
any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should
consult their own advisors.

such financial and other information concerning us, and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection
with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request

property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and
subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S;

(6) it understands and agrees that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Notes or
any beneficial interests in any Notes it will do so only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) for so long as the Notes are
eligible pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that

made in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and (iii) to persons outside the U.S. in an
offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act and in the case of (ii) and (iii)
the purchaser will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify the subsequent purchaser of the Notes
from it of the resale restrictions applicable to the Notes;

During the fiscal year ended 31 August 2018, the number of schools grew to 70, with the acquisitions of the
American British School and Santo Tomas in Chile, the Woodland Pre-Schools in Hong Kong, along with the
opening of the Stamford American School in Hong Kong. The Avondale school in Singapore was also merged
with the Australian International School, Singapore during the year.

Student numbers throughout the Group increased by 8.8% and average FTE staff numbers increased by 9.6% in
the fiscal year ended 31 August 2018 compared to the prior period. The staff numbers increased at a faster rate
than students due to the opening of new facilities.

Student numbers increased (including the impact of acquisitions) by 8.8% in the year, with Europe growing by
0.3%, Asia by 12.6% and Latin America by 15.9%. Europe student numbers grew due to the opening of the
Pre-University Centre at BSB, Spain in April 2018, offset by slightly fewer students in the UK. Asia student
growth was primarily driven by the opening of Stamford American School in Hong Kong in September 2017, the
opening of a new secondary school campus at ISHCMC, Vietnam and the acquisition of Woodland Pre-Schools
group of nurseries in Hong Kong in May 2018. The growth in Latin America is predominantly attributable to the
acquisition of American British School in March 2018 in Chile, along with growth across the Chile school’s
portfolio where the bilingual programme continues to improve utilisation rates. The acquisition of Santo Tomas
in August 2018 did not impact the above disclosed student numbers which are an average across the year.

Capacity increased by 13.3% in the fiscal year ended 31 August 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended
31 August 2017. Of this increase, 8.1% was attributable to group expansion projects, most notably in Singapore,
Hong Kong, Vietnam and Brazil, while the remainder of the increase represented the net impact of acquisitions
and divestments.

On 25 August 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in its joint venture, St Nicholas Preparatory
School Limited in London, UK. Consequently, Group Adjusted EBITDA (including 100% of joint venture
Adjusted EBITDA) is considered the most relevant metric for information purposes.

Group revenue (including 100% of the St Nicholas joint venture in the prior year) increased from £389.7m in
2017 to £430.5m in 2018, an increase of 10.5% or 12.2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue attributable to
new acquisitions during the year ended 31 August 2018 represented 8.7% of the increase (2017: 8.6%), with the
remainder due to the organic increase in student numbers and annual fee inflation.

Regional Group Adjusted EBITDA grew by 10.2% (11.0% on a constant currency basis) and represents a margin
of 18.7% of revenue (2017: 18.9%). Much of this increase relates to Latin America where the acquisition of the
American British School has combined with organic growth across our Chile schools. The Latin America
Regional Adjusted EBITDA grew 40.8% (44.8% on a constant currency basis) on revenues that grew by 14.3%
(19.8% on a constant currency basis) in the same period. Europe also had strong growth in Regional Adjusted
EBITDA of 12.7% (12.2% on a constant currency basis) predominantly related to growth in Spain, including the
opening of the Pre-University Centre at BSB.

Asia Regional Adjusted EBITDA which accounts for 51.0% (2017: 57.4%) of the Regional Group Adjusted
EBITDA fell 2.8% (grew 0.1% on a constant currency basis) during the year. This lack of growth is
predominantly related to the opening of the new capacity in Hong Kong and Vietnam, which increased the
underlying costs and saw a reduction in the region’s utilisation rate. As the new capacity is filled the Asia region
will see operational leverage and EBITDA will grow.

Group central costs reduced by 4.5% to £10.5m (2017: £11.0m) in the year ended 31 August 2018. This decrease
was primarily due to better cost control along with specific operating costs moved to the regions.

The exchange rates used for constant currency are EUR: 0.88137, SGD: 0.55224, HKD: 0.09549, THB: 0.02234,
VND: 0.00003, CLP: 0.00118 and BRL: 0.22868.

**Loss for the year before taxation**

The Group’s loss before tax was £56.5m (2017: £17.8m) for the year ended 31 August 2018, which was
satisfactory and reflective of the ongoing investment in growing the business. The £38.7m increase (2017:
£15.1m decrease) in loss before taxation was largely attributable to one off transaction costs, non-cash share
based payments, impairment, depreciation and amortisation charges.

**Capital expenditure**

During the year, the Group had additions of £58.3m in capital expenditure (2017: £134.0m) and £2.8m (2017:
£2.5m) in software. The capital expenditure reported in the year represents amounts spent on the regular renewal
of estate, along with amounts invested in the expansion plans of the Group’s existing portfolio of schools.

**Strategic report (continued)**

Additions related to development capital expenditure represented £33.4m (2017: £116.8m) in total compared to
operating capital expenditure of £24.9m (2017: £17.2m). Operating capital expenditure includes investment in
ensuring schools maintain their standards and compliance with all regulations, whilst development capital
expenditure represents investment made to expand capacity at the Group’s schools and for construction and
development of other facilities which do not directly result in capacity expansion.

**Developments during the year**

**Europe**

**_Sale and leaseback_**

On 27 February 2018, the Group completed a ground rent sale and leaseback of freehold properties at five UK
schools, the freehold interests were sold for a total consideration of £9.9m. The purchaser simultaneously granted
Cognita 150 year leases over the properties. At expiry of the leases Cognita will have the option to buy back the
freehold interests for £1 per property.

The proceeds of the transaction were used to partially repay the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility, enhancing
Cognita’s liquidity.

**_Expansion of St Nicholas Preparatory School, United Kingdom_**

In March 2018, a lease was signed on a Central London property to enable the relocation of St Nicholas
Preparatory School. Capital investment of c. £11m will be required to convert the building into a school which
will be recovered over time from lower rent payments. The new premises are expected to be open by September
2020, subject to planning permission being granted.

**_Expansion of Southbank International School, United Kingdom_**

In March 2018, a lease agreement was signed on a central London property which adds a fifth site to Southbank
International School and creates an extra c. 240 seats of capacity. The site required approximately £6m of capital
investment and was opened in September 2018.

**_Pre-University Centre, BSB, Spain_**

A state-of-the-art building with capacity for c. 400 students opened in April 2018, housing the new
Pre-University Centre. The centre provides an international pre-university education for students aged 16-19. It
features specially designed seminar and tutorial rooms, a large library with research/self-study area, cafeteria and
sports court. The total cost of the centre was c. €4m.

**Asia**

**_Successful opening of Stamford American School, Hong Kong_**

The Group’s first school in Hong Kong (Stamford American School) opened in September 2017, with over 350
students. The Group completed the purchase of the school property in Kowloon, Hong Kong on 15 April 2016.
The building now has capacity for c. 800 students. The total capital expenditure additions were HKD 992m
(c. £90m) including HKD 673m (c. £61m) for the initial purchase excluding fees and expenses of the brownfield
property.

**_Construction of new campus, Vietnam_**

In January 2018, a new 900 seat campus opened at the International School Ho Chi Minh City (ISHCMC). The
new campus is a purpose-built secondary school and doubles the capacity of ISHCMC. The Group has additions
of c. £12m in the facility which has been constructed and financed by a local developer and leased on a 32 year
term. The Group also prepaid rent and a lease deposit of c. £5m. It will allow ISHCMC to continue to grow
enrolments which are currently c. 1,100.

**_Acquisition of Woodland Pre-Schools, Hong Kong_**

On 2 May 2018, the Group acquired Woodland Pre-Schools, a group of nine nurseries in Hong Kong. Woodland,
which was founded in 1978, offers playgroup and preschool classes to c. 2,000 predominantly expatriate children
who progress to the leading international schools in Hong Kong. The acquisition was funded from the additional
issue of Senior Secured Loan Notes earlier in the year along with local bank debt. Woodland Pre-Schools is
treated as one school for the purposes of stating the number of schools operated by the Group.

**Latam**

**_Expansion of GayLussac school, Brazil_**

The expansion of the GayLussac school in Brazil was successfully completed and the new facilities opened ready
for the new academic year in February 2018. The project provides enhanced facilities and nine new classrooms,
creating incremental capacity for c. 220 students. It will bring the total school capacity for students and the
bilingual programme to c. 1,670. The expansion cost a total of BRL 12.4m (c. £2.8m).

**_Acquisition of the American British School, Chile_**

On 1 March 2018, the Group acquired Sociedad Educacional American British School Limitada, a school based
in Santiago, Chile. The acquisition was funded from the additional issue of Senior Secured Loan Notes and local
bank debt. The school had c. 2,600 students, with a capacity of c. 3,000 at the date of acquisition.

**_Acquisition of Santo Tomas, Chile_**

On 31 August 2018, the Group acquired Colegio Santo Tomas de Nunoa Limitada, school based in Santiago,
Chile. The acquisition was funded from two sources, 90% from the issue of Senior Secured Loan Notes earlier in
the year, the remaining 10% through a vendor loan, which will all be settled by 28 February 2020. On
acquisition, Santo Tomas had c. 1,300 students, with capacity for c. 1,500.

**Group**

**_Funding secured to support Group growth_**

On 22 February 2018, an additional £60m of Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued via a private placement at a
premium of £1.95m to par value. The proceeds of the offering together with local bank debt, were used to acquire
the American British School, Chile, and Woodland Pre-Schools, Hong Kong and used to repay the Revolving
Credit Facility and enhance Group liquidity.

**_British referendum on Europe_**

As a UK based organisation with global operations, management recognises our business may be impacted by the
implications of the UK’s separation from the EU. Whilst the timing and nature of the UK’s separation from the
EU remains unclear, there are currently no significant adverse implications to business operations and results to
report. However, management have identified some areas that could have an impact on the business, which will
be monitored as the UK goes through the Brexit process:

_Currency exposure: Fluctuations in exchange rates will impact Group results which are reported in pounds_
sterling. Approximately 65% of Group revenue, 86% of Group EBITDA are denominated in foreign currency.
The Group settled the foreign exchange hedge liabilities as part of the acquisition of the Group by Jacobs
Holding AG. The exposure to foreign exchange risks are now being assessed by management and hedging
options are being considered to mitigate the current exposures under new ownership.

_Student and staffing recruitment and retention: London’s status as a financial centre could be compromised,_
which in turn may affect demand for international schools. However, the weakening of the pound sterling against
other major currencies may make Cognita’s UK independent schools more competitive internationally as tuition

fees become more affordable for foreign families looking to educate their children in the UK. A further
consideration is that attracting and retaining students and teachers from the EU may become more difficult if visa
entry requirements become more stringent or if our UK Visa and Immigrations Tier 2 and/or Tier 4 licences are
revoked or cease to be renewed.

_Regulatory changes: Cognita will be working closely with the National Association of British Schools in Spain,_
the Council of British International Schools and the British Council to review the impact of Brexit, if any, on the
use of British qualifications for Spanish university entry and on Spanish students applying to British universities.

_Downturn in the UK or European Economy: With operations in UK and Spain a downturn in the economies of_
mainland Europe or the UK following Brexit could result in reduced demand for school places and lower student
numbers.

Management’s view is that the Group’s diverse global portfolio and the robust nature of the education sector will
provide resilience against the uncertainties faced during the Brexit transition period.

**Post balance sheet events**

**_Acquisition of Cognita Group_**

On 25 October 2018, the Cognita Group was sold by its previous owners, KKR European Fund III LP and Bregal
Fund III LP, to Jacobs Holding AG. Jacobs are a family controlled professional investment firm, the sole
economic beneficiary of which is the Jacobs Foundation. The Jacobs Foundation is a non-profit, charity
organisation with the exclusive aim to improve the lives of young people around the world.

The acquisition of the Group has prompted a refinancing of the majority of the Group’s debt with new bank
facilities being drawn on 25 October 2018 totalling £652 million. This enabled the group to settle liabilities that
were outstanding at 31 August 2018, including the Senior Secured Loan Notes, Revolving Credit Facilities and
Forward Currency Contracts, along with local debt in Hong Kong. Further funding is also in the process of being
negotiated.

**_Acquisition of Colegio Europeo de Madrid, Spain_**

On 6 November 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of 90% of the Colegio Europeo de Madrid, a
bilingual school located in Madrid, Spain catering for students aged 0-18. On acquisition, the school had c. 650
students with a capacity of c. 1,000. The acquisition was funded by a further £1.5m of bank debt drawn from the
Group’s new facilities.

**Future developments**

The Group will continue to invest in its existing schools, with some strategic development projects planned for
the year ended 31 August 2019 and beyond. The Group will continue to develop opportunities in all regions.

**Statement of Going Concern**

The Group and Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect their future development,
performance and position are set out in this report. The financial position of the Group and Company, its cash
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out in the financial statements. The Group and
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital are described in note 1 to the financial
statements. Further information on the Group’s capital management can be found in note 25 to the financial
statements.

Details of the Group and Company’s financial risk management objectives, its financial instruments and hedging
activities; and exposures to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are set out below and in further detail in
note 25 to the financial statements.

**Cognita Bondco Parent Limited**
**Annual Report and Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2018**

**Strategic report (continued)**

During the year ended 31 August 2016, the Group refinanced substantially all of its debt, with the exception of
debt held by Group companies in Brazil and Chile. Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued and the proceeds
were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness and related costs. The Notes were due to mature on 15 August
2021. As part of this refinancing arrangement, deep discounted bonds previously issued by Cognita Topco
Limited were collapsed via a capitalisation.

At 31 August 2018, the Group had a total of £435m of Senior Secured Loan Notes in issue, £60m of which had
been placed during the year. The post year end acquisition of the Cognita Topco Limited Group by Jacobs
Holding AG prompted a refinancing of the majority of the Group’s debt, with new bank facilities drawn on
25 October 2018 totalling £652 million. This enabled the group to settle liabilities that were outstanding at
31 August 2018, including the £435m of Senior Secured Loan Notes, the Revolving Credit Facilities and
Forward Currency Contracts, along with local debt in Hong Kong.

The Directors have performed a review of the Group’s finances and have a reasonable expectation that the
business has adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future and will be able to support the repayment
of its debt facilities and related interest payments. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

**Controlling parties and ultimate parent undertaking**

The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is Cognita Midco Limited, a company incorporated in England
and Wales. At 31 August 2018, the ultimate parent undertaking was Cognita Topco Limited, a company
incorporated in Jersey which was jointly controlled by The Bregal Fund III LP and Crimson Cayman Holding
Limited, which itself is controlled by KKR European Fund III LP (see note 30). On 25 October 2018, Cognita
Topco Limited was acquired by Lernen Bidco Limited from which time the ultimate parent undertaking and
controlling party of the Group became Jacobs Holding AG.

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties**

The management of the business and the execution of the Group’s strategy are subject to a number of risks. Risks
are reviewed by the Board of Directors and appropriate processes put in place to monitor and mitigate them. The
key business risks for the Group are described in more detail below:

**Child protection and safeguarding**

The Group may be liable for certain acts that affect the health and safety of students and staff at schools, or
which breach the duty of care towards students, which may harm the Group’s reputation and adversely affect the
business and financial results. To mitigate this risk, the Group has policies and procedures in place which are
aligned to regulatory standards and are globally consistent. It also has an independent review framework to
monitor the performance of schools and to ensure policies and procedures are being followed.

**Authorisation to operate as an education provider**

The Group requires authorisation to operate as an education provider from the relevant government department
for education in each country in which it operates. The Group also needs to comply with the policies, laws and
regulations for school operations in each country and obtain the necessary licences, permits, visas, accreditations,
certifications and other authorisations for operating our schools and employing our teachers. The Group monitors
compliance with such policies, laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

**Health and safety**

The prevention of injury to employees, students, parents and other customers in the Group is of utmost
importance. The Group has clear policies and procedures which are in place and aligned to regulatory standards.

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

**Market forces**

Market forces have implications on pricing, demand for the Group’s services and ultimately the Group’s return
on investment. The Group invests in market research across all regions to ensure that it has a detailed and current
knowledge and understanding of the sector in which it operates and the related risks arising from market forces.

To minimise the possible impact of market forces, the Group focuses on delivering the highest standard of
education, to ensure that Cognita schools are competitive in their respective markets, even when market forces
cause unfavourable economic conditions.

**Political environment**

The Group is subject to the political conditions of each country in which it operates. Political events and unrest
can lead to issues such as sudden changes in laws, regulations, taxes and price volatility. Political unrest can also
impact the environments in which the school operates and destabilise a country, impacting on the performance of
schools. The Group monitors political risk to ensure compliance with local requirements and minimises exposure
to changes through maintaining and modifying appropriate business procedures as necessary.

During the year the Group has maintained and reviewed its anti-bribery and corruption policy which
encompasses existing controls as well as additional procedures. Anti-bribery and corruption procedures are
reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure continued compliance.

**ICT systems and infrastructure**

The Directors understand the importance of ICT within the business. The Group has controls and disaster
recovery plans in place in case of a significant system failure. The Group is also committed to enhancing the
current provision of ICT systems through ongoing investment into the business, including investment in a new
ERP solution, HR system and CRM during the year.

**Cyber risk and data protection**

The Group collects and retains personal data and unauthorised disclosure of this data due to a systems failure or
otherwise could have a damaging effect on the business. The Group has policies and procedures in place which
are aligned to regulatory standards and has implemented additional controls and processes and undertaken
suitable staff training, with the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

**Human resources**

Retention of high quality staff both educational and non-educational is critical to the success of the business. The
Group’s employment policies, remuneration and benefits packages are regularly reviewed to ensure we can
attract and retain the best staff.

Cognita is committed to preserving and promoting equality of opportunity in all aspects of the conduct of its
business and at all stages of the working relationship. No member of staff or any applicant for employment with
Cognita will be discriminated against, harassed or victimised because of their personal characteristics.

**Supporting growth**

The continued growth and financial performance of the Group depends on having the right resources in place.
Consequently, the Group continually assesses the needs of each region to ensure that the Group’s infrastructure
continues to expand in line with growth to ensure the necessary resources for current and future development.

A key focus of the Group is to ensure that newly acquired schools are integrated efficiently and effectively. This
enables minimal disruption, continuity in educational provision and access to key improvements and benefits
which membership of the Group can offer.

**Annual Report and Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2018**

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

**Financial capital risk**

The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, equity investments and various items,
such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to facilitate the Group’s operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are
described in more detail below.

In order to manage the Group’s exposure to those risks, in particular the Group’s exposure to exchange rate risk,
the Group has entered into a number of derivative transactions including foreign currency forward contracts. All
derivative contracts outstanding at 31 August 2018 were settled on 25 October 2018 and management are
reviewing future options for hedging exchange rate risk.

All transactions in derivatives are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities and
no transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, interest
rate risk and credit risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are
summarised below.

**Macroeconomic environment**

Our operations are affected by the general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we operate.
These macroeconomic conditions are monitored on an ongoing basis along with the impact on our current and
future financial performance. Risks identified during the year included the potential impact of the British
referendum on the EU, slower than historical growth in the Asia region, driven by global macroeconomic
environment changes, and ongoing political risks in Catalonia, Spain.

To date, we have seen limited impact of these factors on our financial performance due to the importance of
education spend for parents and the general stability of the markets in which we operate, as well as our focus on
controlling our costs. Whilst for these reasons management believes our revenue and profitability are relatively
resilient to fluctuations as a result of macroeconomic conditions, we will continue to monitor developments and
the potential related risks.

**Liquidity risk**

The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and by investing cash assets safely and profitably.

The Group is supported by its ultimate parent to ensure continuity of funding. In 2015, the Group secured
funding by issuing £280m of Senior Secured Loan Notes. In the current and preceding year, a further £155m was
raised through additional issuances, through private placements of Senior Secured Loan Notes. Additionally, the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility increased to £100m during the year ended 31 August 2017. Further local
financing is sourced where possible for acquisitions and developments.

On 25 October 2018, as part of a Group refinancing exercise in conjunction with the acquisition of the Group by
Jacobs Holding AG, the Senior Secured Loan Notes were redeemed, and the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility was repaid in full using the proceeds of new bank facilities totalling £652m. Local debt facilities in Hong
Kong were also settled as part of the refinancing.

The maturity of borrowings at the Balance Sheet date is set out in note 19 to the financial statements. In total, as
at 31 August 2018, the Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group had drawn borrowings of £630.9m (2017:

F-13

**Cognita Bondco Parent Limited**

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

£515.5m), of which £561.8m (2017: £475.6m) was repayable after 31 August 2019. This included £430.4m of
Senior Secured Loan Notes due in August 2021. Following the refinancing of debt in October 2018, the Group
had drawn borrowings totalling £703.6m at the date of signing this report and committed unutilised facilities
totalling £123m. Of the total facilities available at the date of this report, £720.8m would be repayable after
31 August 2019. This includes bank loans and facilities totalling £675m with repayment dates in 2025 or beyond.

**Foreign exchange risk**

The Group’s results are reported in pounds sterling. Where possible, the Group seeks to manage the effect of any
exposure that may arise from the translation of the foreign currency assets by borrowing funds denominated in
the local currency of the entity it acquires, or will use hedging instruments to mitigate the exchange risk.

The Group reassessed its hedging arrangements following the Group refinancing in 2015 to cover its sterling
exposure on the Senior Secured Loan Notes by entering into forward currency contracts. Further details are
disclosed in note 21 of the financial statements. The Group’s forward currency contracts were settled in full on
25 October 2018, with the change of control to Jacobs Holding AG. Following the settlement of the hedging
instruments, management are reviewing the exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and hedging options are
being considered to mitigate the risk.

Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign subsidiaries, Group exposure to currency
risk at a transactional level is minimal. The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are usually carried
out in local currency.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through fixed rate Senior Secured Loan Notes, bank borrowings and
Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its bank borrowings is managed
by the use of hedging or fixed interest rate instruments. It is the Group’s policy to use fixed interest rate
instruments or to use fixed rate hedging instruments to fix interest rates on at least 50% of its bank borrowings.
At the date of signing this report the group was financed through a Term loan with interest calculated at a fixed
margin (currently 4.5%-5.0%) over LIBOR/EURIBOR. a bridging loan facility with interest currently calculated
at a 6.0% margin over EURIBOR, and local debt facilities totalling £55.0m with interest rates ranging from
1.5%-12.25%.

**Credit risk**

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The credit risk associated with cash is
limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The
principal credit risk therefore arises from its trade receivables.

In order to manage credit risk, management sets limits for customers in accordance with prudent general practice
in the independent education sector. Credit limits are reviewed by credit controllers on a regular basis in
conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.

**Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law they have elected to prepare both the group and the parent company financial statements in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that
period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:

 - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

 - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;

 - state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

 - assess the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern; and

 - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group and Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and
Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

affairs as at 31 August 2018 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;

 - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

 - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted
by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

 - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and
are independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**Going concern**

We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is
inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. We have
nothing to report in these respects.

**Strategic Report and Directors’ Report**

The Directors are responsible for the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and, in doing so, consider whether,
based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work:

 - we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report;

 - in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

 - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

 - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

 - certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (continued)**

**Directors’ responsibilities**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on F-16, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

**The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Annual Report and Financial Statements**

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**1 Accounting policies**

**_General information_**

Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cognita Midco Limited. The ultimate parent company
at the date of balance sheet was Cognita Topco Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey. On 25 October 2018,
Cognita Topco Limited and the entire Cognita Group was acquired by Lernen Bidco Limited, a company
registered in England and Wales. From this date, the ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is Jacobs
Holding AG. See note 32 for further information.

The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) during the period
was the operation of private-pay K-12 schools and related education activities. These financial statements are for
this Company and the Group.

**_Basis of preparation_**

Both the Company and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). On
publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is
taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income
statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of the following assets and
liabilities which are stated at their fair value in accordance with the relevant Adopted IFRSs:

 - Derivative financial instruments

 - Liabilities for equity-settled share based payments.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all years
presented in these consolidated financial statements.

Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on
the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed
in note 33.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s interest in its jointly controlled entity. Control exists when the
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Total comprehensive
income is attributed to non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit
balance.

The governance of a jointly controlled entity is established by contractual agreement which requires the
venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. Therefore, the Group has joint
control of the entities’ activities. The equity method is used to account for the jointly controlled entity. The
Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity
movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint
control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.

**_Going concern_**

The Group has continued to expand both organically and via acquisitions during the year. The growth has been
funded from operating cash flow and short and long term borrowings (see note 19). Future growth will be funded
from suitable financing arrangements as well as cash flows generated from operations.

The information disclosed in the Strategic Report explains the Directors’ assessment of risk within the Group.
The Group is structured to enable sharing of resources where possible, including banking arrangements and
liquid assets between Group companies. The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage these business
risks in the current economic climate.

On 25 October 2018, in conjunction with the acquisition of the Group by Jacobs Holding AG, the Group has
refinanced the majority of its debt. New bank facilities were drawn totaling £652 million which enabled the
Group to settle certain liabilities which were outstanding at 31 August 2018 including the Senior Secured Loan
Notes, Revolving Credit Facilities and Forward Currency Contracts along with local debt in Hong Kong. The
new bank debt available at the date of this report consisted of a term loan facility totaling £450 million which is
repayable in October 2025 and a bridge loan of £225 million which is repayable in October 2026. In addition to
this, there is a Revolving Credit Facility of £100 million which has a termination date of April 2025.
Management are considering replacing the £225 million bridge facility with new Loan Notes between the date of
signing these financial statements and the end of the financial year.

The Directors have performed a review of the Group’s cash flows up to 30 November 2019 and have a
reasonable expectation that the business has adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future. The
Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial
statements.

The principal accounting policies are set out below. They have remained unchanged from the previous year.

**_Foreign currency_**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated
financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling,
which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Group.

i) Foreign currency transactions

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.

At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the income statement, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.

ii) Foreign operations

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign
operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to the Group’s

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**_Foreign currency (continued)_**

presentational currency at foreign exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. The revenues and
expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising are reported as an item
of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve, attributed to non-controlling interests
as appropriate.

Exchange differences arising from monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the
settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net
investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.

**_Classification of financial instruments_**

The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories:

 - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

 - Held to maturity financial assets

 - Loans and receivables

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
substance of the contractual arrangement.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised as proceeds received, net of direct issue
costs.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.

**_Non-derivative financial instruments_**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, cash and cash
equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other interest bearing loans and
borrowings.

**_Investments in equity securities_**

Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the parent company accounts.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents
includes bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any impairment losses. Due to their shortterm nature, the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. A provision for
impairment of receivables is applied where there is empirical evidence that the Group will not be able to recover
the contracted cash inflows. When certainty is obtained that a receivable is not recoverable, the specific
receivable is written off.

**Annual Report and Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2018**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Trade and other payables_**

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value
of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

**_Interest-bearing borrowings_**

Senior Secured Loan Notes and bank borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Where amortised cost using straight line amortisation
approximates the outcome under the effective interest method, the straight line method is adopted.

**_Derivative financial instruments and hedging_**

The Group uses forward contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange and
interest rates of bank borrowings. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The fair value of
interest rate swaps are based on Mark to Market values provided by the issuing financial institutions. These
values are mid-market levels as at close of business on the balance sheet date. The gain or loss on
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group has not adopted hedge
accounting in relation to these instruments.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are
classified as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land
is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at
an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at
inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, using the
straight-line method over the useful economic life of that asset. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful
lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Freehold buildings – 20 to 60 years
Short leasehold land and buildings – the remaining life of the lease
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 1 to 10 years
Computer equipment – 2 to 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted if
appropriate.

Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. Upon completion the asset will be transferred into the
relevant category of property, plant and equipment and will be depreciated over its estimated useful life.

**_Business combinations_**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.

**Annual Report and Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2018**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Business combinations (continued)_**

When the Group obtains control of a previously jointly controlled entity, the transaction is recorded as a disposal
of the investment in the jointly controlled entity and the acquisition of a subsidiary. The profit or loss on disposal
of the jointly controlled entity is the fair value of the original holding less its carrying amount.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

 - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

 - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus

 - the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

 - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are
expensed as incurred.

On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both
present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of
liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net
assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value at
the acquisition date.

**_Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests_**

Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for
as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and, therefore, no goodwill is recognised as a result of
such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net
assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which
non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.

**_Assets held for sale_**

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally
through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

**_Goodwill and Intangible assets_**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Where the total of consideration
transferred and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income
statement.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill at fair value
if those assets are separately identifiable and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

**_Goodwill and Intangible assets (continued)_**

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of
intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and intangibles with an indefinite useful life are not
amortised but are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Capitalised software and other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives of other intangibles are as follows:

Computer software – 3 years
Customer contracts – average tenure of a student at relevant school
School licences – over the length of the licence
Brands – 10-20 years
Favourable leases – over the remaining length of the lease

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle
and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs in bringing them to their existing
location and condition.

**_Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets_**

_Financial assets (including receivables)_

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence
indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a
negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

_Non-financial assets_

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill is assessed
for impairment at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition and subsequently at each reporting date.

Indications of impairment are identified by reviewing events or changes in circumstance which suggest that the
carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount
is estimated. The recoverable amount is deemed to be the higher of net realisable value (fair value less costs to
sell) and value in use.

Value in use is calculated by discounting estimated future post-tax cash flows to their present value using a
post-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset.

The discount rate applied is based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group’s operations in
the country the asset sits. Estimated future cash flows are based on Board approved budgets and mid-term plans
which represent our best estimate of future performance, supported by historical trends, known operating margins
and achievable growth or cost saving targets. An inflationary growth rate of 2.25% was used to extrapolate
beyond five years for all regions with the exclusion of Brazil where 4.95% was used, representing the inflation
rate for the business based on latest economic information.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets (continued)_**

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash
inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).

The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cashgenerating units (“CGU”). Impairment testing is performed at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for
internal reporting purposes. Therefore a CGU represents an individual school or group of schools purchased as
one business acquisition transaction. No individual CGUs are considered significant in comparison to the total
carrying value of goodwill.

Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised
in the income statement. Impairment losses in respect of a CGU are initially allocated against the carrying
amount of goodwill allocated to the units and then subsequently against the carrying amounts of other assets
within the CGU.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are irreversible. Impairment losses recognised against other
assets can be subsequently reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are therefore assessed at each reporting date for
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that
the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable for services or goods provided in the
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is recognised based on
the following criteria:

 - it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the Group

 - the revenue can be measured reliably

 - the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably

Revenue is generated from the provision of educational services and the sale of related services and goods. The
recognition of material revenue streams is detailed below:

 - **Tuition fees**

These are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the service provision. The fee will be recognised
over the full 12 months of that academic year. Annual fee rates are used as the basis for calculating the monthly
fee recognised.

 - **Application/enrolment fees**

These fees relate to the processing of new applications and where successful, a formal offer of a place within one
of the Group’s schools is made. These fees are recognised at the point at which an application is processed.

 - **Development/facility fees/capital levies**

This is a fee for the provision of the facilities made available to a student during their tenure at a Group school.
These fees are dependent upon the provision of tuition services and are therefore directly linked. The revenue is

**_Revenue (continued)_**

recognised over the expected tenure of a student within the school. The expected tenure is considered on a school
by school basis and this estimate is reconsidered on an annual basis.

 - **Holiday camp revenue**

Fees payable for holiday camp services are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the service
provision.

 - **Other revenue**

This represents a number of income streams including fees for information technology, transportation, clubs,
trips and income from the sale of books, uniforms and canteen sales. Revenue is recognised upon the provision of
services or upon sale of goods.

All revenue is presented net of discounts, the recognition of which is consistent with the related revenue stream.

**_Employee benefits_**

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.

_Multi-employer plans_

The Group participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (“the TPS”), in respect of certain
teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan and it is not possible for the Group to use
defined benefit accounting as sufficient information is not available. Accordingly, no provision can be made for
any under or over provision of funding within the plan as required under IAS 19 and the scheme is therefore
accounted for in the same way as if it were a defined contribution plan. For further detail on the TPS see note 23.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of
past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

_Share based payment transactions_

Share based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own
equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment transactions, regardless of how the
equity instruments are obtained by the Group.

Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the
grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the
determination of the fair value of equity-settled share based transactions are set out in note 9.

The fair-value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Employee benefits (continued)_**

At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as
a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates,
if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with
the corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.

**_Provisions_**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as
a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount
is the present value of those cash flows.

**_Expenses_**

_Operating lease payments_

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total
lease expense.

_Finance lease payments_

Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding
liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

_Financing income and expenses_

Financing expenses comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance
leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions,
and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see foreign currency accounting
policy). Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset
that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Financing
income comprise interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.

Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest
method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments
is established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

**_Taxation_**

Tax on the loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Taxation (continued)_**

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences
are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised.

**_Non-underlying items_**

Non-underlying items are disclosed separately in order to provide comparability between periods. They comprise
income and expenditure which is not related to the Group’s core operating activities, including acquisition and
business exploration costs, restructuring costs, impairment of assets, profit and loss on disposal of fixed assets,
school pre-opening losses, non-cash share based payment expense, and costs associated with the acquisition of
the Group by Jacobs Holding AG.

**Standards issued but not yet effective**

The material new standards and interpretations that are endorsed by the EU but not yet effective up to the date of
balance sheet are disclosed below and will be adopted where applicable when they become effective, except
where otherwise stated.

IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and
liabilities and replaces the guidance provided by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’
with effect for the year ending 31 August 2019. Early application is permitted. The key change for the Group
arising from IFRS 9 is in the requirement to use an expected loss model for recognition of bad debt provisions
across the whole Group, however, the impact on the Group is not expected to be material.

IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ deals with revenue recognition and focuses on the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and its related cash flows. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and
IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and is effective for the year ending 31 August 2019. Early application is
permitted. The adoption of IFRS 15 will change the timing of revenue recognition with tuition and associated
fees being recognised on a term time basis instead of the current policy of being recognised evenly over the year.
Management’s latest estimate of the impact of adopting IFRS 15 in the year ending 31 August 2019 is that it will
decrease revenue by c. £1m. The increase in opening deferred revenue as at 1 September 2018 and the
corresponding debit to equity reserve has not yet been finalised but is estimated to be in the region of £1-5m.

IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ considers the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and also deals with
the disclosure of useful information relating to leasing activities. The standard replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and a
key change is that most operating leases, held by lessees, will be accounted for on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 is
effective for the year ending 31 August 2020, with early adoption permitted, as long as the standard is not
adopted prior to IFRS 15. The full financial consequences of adopting IFRS 16 are being calculated by
management but are expected to be material. On transition to the new standard, the Group will derecognise
certain balances associated with IAS 17, including prepaid and accrued rent, onerous lease provisions and
recognise a new right of use asset offset by a lease liability. The adoption of the standard will increase Adjusted
EBITDA by replacing rental charges in the income statement with interest and depreciation charges.

**2 Acquisitions of subsidiaries**

**_Acquisitions in the current period_**

During the year, the Group completed three acquisitions: American British School in Santiago, Chile, Woodland
Pre-Schools in Hong Kong and Santo Tomas in Santiago, Chile.

The group incurred costs related to these acquisitions of £2,081,000 relating to legal and financial due diligence
and transaction costs during the year ended 31 August 2018 (2017: £434,000). These costs have been included in
non-underlying costs in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Goodwill recognised on acquisition is mainly attributable to the value of synergies of integrating the operations
of the business with those of the Group as well as the skills and knowledge of the employees of the schools
acquired. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Cash outflows from operations are reflected in the Consolidated Cash flow Statements on F-25. Cash outflows
relating to acquisitions are shown net of cash acquired and include deferred consideration paid in respect of prior
year investments.

If all of the acquisitions had occurred on 1 September 2017, the Group revenue would have been £445,920,000
and the Group net loss would have been £45,056,000. In determining these amounts, management has assumed
that the fair value adjustment that arose on the dates of the acquisitions would have been the same if the
acquisitions had occurred on 1 September 2017.

More detail is provided on each acquisition below:

**American British School, Chile**

On 1 March 2018, the Group acquired a 100% shareholding in Sociedad Educacional American British School
Limitada for a total consideration of CLP 21,821m.

The school is an independent Chilean curriculum school located in South East Santiago, Chile. It provides
education to students aged 3-18 with an emphasis on English language. The school had c. 2,600 students at the
date of acquisition, with a total capacity of c. 3,000. The acquisition expands the Group’s educational offering in
Santiago and provides an excellent opportunity for further growth in student numbers in Chile.

In the period from acquisition to 31 August 2018, the American British School contributed £3,660,000 of
revenue and £170,000 profit to the consolidated net loss for the year.

**Woodland Pre-Schools, Hong Kong**

On 2 May 2018, the Group acquired the trade and assets of Woodland Pre-Schools along with 100% of the issued
shares in the seven companies which hold the property leases of the schools, for a total consideration of
HKD 446m. Shortly before the acquisition, three new companies were set up in order to acquire the trade and
assets and equity interests of the business.

Woodland Pre-Schools is a group of nine nurseries with c. 2,000 students which each comprise a pre-school and
a playgroup. It is the largest international pre-school chain in Hong Kong, providing education to students aged 2
to 6 years. The acquisition is expected to increase Cognita’s market share in Hong Kong and provide a feeder
into the Stamford American School, Hong Kong.

In the period from acquisition to 31 August 2018, the Woodland Pre-Schools contributed £4,917,000 of revenue
and £87,000 profit to the consolidated net loss for the year.

Woodland Pre-Schools is treated as one school for the purposes of stating the number of schools operated by the
Group.

**Santo Tomas, Chile**

On 31 August 2018, the Group acquired a 100% shareholding in Colegio Santo Tomas de Nunoa Limitada for a
total consideration of CLP 3,226m.

Santo Tomas is an independent K-12 school in the Nunoa district, central-eastern Santiago which converted in
2017 from private-subsidised to a fully private school. On acquisition the school had c. 1,300 students and a
capacity of c. 1,500. The acquisition of the school will further increase the Group’s offering in Santiago,
particularly in combination with the acquisition of the American British School noted above.

As Santo Tomas was acquired on the last day of the accounting period, it did not contribute to the consolidated
results for the year.

The net assets and goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Santo Tomas as disclosed above should be
considered our best estimates based on available information and could therefore be subject to change. As the
acquisition of Santo Tomas took place on the last day of the financial year, it was not practically possible to
determine the fair values of the net assets acquired in time for inclusion within these financial statements. In
accordance with IFRS 3, the Group has 12 months to finalise the acquisition accounting.

**4 Operating Segments**

The Group’s principal activity during the year was the operation of private schools and related education
activities.

At the year end the Group operated 70 (2017: 67) schools across Europe, Asia and Latin America. The Directors
consider these three segments as the Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8.

This segmental analysis shows the results of these divisions. Revenue is income earned by the Group from third
parties and is stated net of intersegmental revenue, in line with the reports reviewed by the chief decision makers.
Intersegmental revenue mainly includes management charges.

The Group analyses its results at Adjusted EBITDA level on an underlying basis with separate disclosure of
non-underlying costs in arriving at its results before tax. Adjusted EBITDA is the performance measure observed
by the chief decision makers and is defined as underlying operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and
impairment charges. Profit/loss before tax is not reviewed on an operating segment basis by the chief decision
makers, therefore, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Profit/loss before tax is shown below for
completeness. Refer to note 5 for an analysis of non-underlying items.

**5 Non-underlying items (continued)**

Non-underlying costs relate to Europe £29,045,000 (2017: £6,718,000), Asia £6,345,000 (2017: £9,496,000) and
Latin America £10,297,000 (2017: £1,243,000).

Non-underlying items are items of income or expenditure which for the Board and financial statement reporting
purposes are disclosed separately because in management’s judgement, due to their nature, size or incidence,
they distort an understanding of the Group’s financial performance and comparability between periods. The
items of expenditure which management designate as being non-underlying include acquisition and business
exploration costs, restructuring costs, impairments of assets, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets and
share based payment schemes.

Impairment costs relate to the write down of assets identified as being impaired. Each year all CGUs and their
associated assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment. If identified as being impaired, an impairment charge
will be made to the income statement. The impairment charge for an individual CGU, which does not result in a
cash cost to the business, is generally one-off in nature and, therefore, is not considered to be a recurring item. In
the event that an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the reversal is treated consistently with the initial
write down and would be recognised within non-underlying items.

Acquisition and business exploration costs are expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or
expansion opportunities including future business development into new countries and regions. These include
any legal and due diligence fees relating to potential or actual acquisitions as well as losses incurred prior to the
opening of new schools. Although costs relating to projects can span multiple financial years, key components of
expenditure for specific projects are non-recurring, for example financial due diligence, legal due diligence, and
market surveys. These costs have no relation to the operational results of existing schools and are split out to
enable the reader of the financial statements to gain greater clarity of the underlying business performance.

Restructuring costs mainly relate to employment cessation and associated legal costs. These costs are incurred
annually but relate to different projects and by their nature will only occur once.

Share based payment costs represent the income statement charge relating to the management incentive plan
(MIP). This charge relates to the MIP put in place in June 2013, described in note 9. This charge does not result
in a cash cost to the business and has therefore been shown as non-underlying.

All accounting policies are applied consistently between periods unless disclosures are made in the financial
statements to the effect that there has been an accounting policy change, in which case, the impact of such change
on the comparative numbers will be disclosed.

The tax effect of the non-underlying costs in 2018 was a credit of £203,000 (2017: £449,000).

During the year, three (2017: three) Directors had awards receivable in the form of shares under a long-term
incentive plan.

On 31 March 2016, the Group provided an interest free, unsecured loan of £400,089 to M Uzielli, a Director of
the Company, to enable him to participate in the Cognita Group Management Incentive Plan. This was repaid in
full on 25 October 2018.

On 29 June 2018, the Group provided further interest free loans of £693,000 each to C Jansen and M Uzielli,
both Directors of the Company, to enable them to participate further in the Cognita Group Management Incentive
Plan. £ 606,000 of each of these loans was repaid and the remaining £87,000 was waived on 25 October 2018.

**9 Share based payments**

In June 2013, a management incentive plan (“MIP”) was introduced whereby certain Directors and senior
managers were awarded C shares in the Company. The C shares have limited rights and there is no entitlement to
dividends.

The rewards associated with the MIP are achieved by meeting specific IRR hurdles on the future sale, partial
sale, winding up, distribution or listing of shares in Cognita Topco Limited. These rewards are incremental and
will increase based on the IRR that is achieved by the main shareholders of Cognita Topco Limited. Should the
specific hurdles be achieved, the rewards will be payable to the participants of the MIP.

A number of new participants were granted shares in the incentive plan in the year ended 31 August 2018. The
nature and rewards attached to the C shares granted remain consistent with those previously issued. New

participants to the MIP scheme, were also eligible to acquire B shares in Cognita Topco Limited, these shares
rank pari passu with one another and entitle the B shareholders to participate in the profits of the Company. The
terms associated with these shares under the MIP are consistent with those relating to the C shares. During the
year ending 31 August 2018, 850 C2 and C3 shares and 61,500 B3 and B4 shares were issued (2017: no shares
issued). The weighted average fair value of the C and B shares was £9,864 and £3,304 respectively. The total
charge for the shares issued in the year was £22,386,000 which is being spread over the expected vesting period.
In May 2018, the vesting period was revised to assume a vesting date of 1 December 2018. This led to an
acceleration of the charge to the income statement.

Valuations were performed by an independent third party at each of the grant dates. Due to the complex features
of the awards, the fair value of these shares at the grant date were derived using a binomial model.

The following assumptions were applied in determining the fair value of the awards granted during the year:

 - An assumed equity value was estimated at each grant date

 - A realisation event was assumed to occur at 31 August 2020

 - A risk free rate of return ranging from 0.53% to 0.79%

 - A future volatility rate ranging from 33.28 to 34.26% was estimated based on the historical volatility of
comparable public companies adjusted for unique or significant events not expected to affect future
volatility

 - An annual employee exit rate of 0% has been factored into the assumptions, as shares are transferred to
other participants

In March 2016, the UK Government announced its intention to further reduce the main rate of UK corporation
tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.

Existing temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided may therefore unwind in future periods
at this reduced rate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated based on the rate of 17%
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

During the year, the Group wrote down £8,303,000 (year ended 31 August 2017: £2,516,000) of property, plant
and equipment following a review for impairment. This includes the £4,937,000 of impairment booked in
relation to the sale and leaseback transaction earlier in the year in respect of three UK schools. The Group also
reversed impairments of £2,393,000 (2017: nil) relating to property, plant and equipment during the year. The
impairment calculation was performed in line with the Group’s impairment accounting policy. Further details of
the key assumptions and sensitivities within this calculation are given in note 13. The impairment loss for the
year ended 31 August 2018 is allocated against Freehold land and buildings (2017: Freehold land and buildings)
and is included in operating loss within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Disclosure of capital commitments can be found in note 28 of the financial statements.

**12 Property, plant and equipment—Group (continued)**

During the year, the Group completed a ground rent sale and leaseback of freehold properties at five UK
schools—see note 19. The carrying value of the leased assets as at 31 August 2018 was £23,175,000 (2017:
£12,500,000).

Following the partial disposal of the Chilton Cantelo school buildings in June 2017, the remaining buildings have
been transferred to assets held for sale. The sale of the buildings is considered highly probable and they are being
actively marketed. As at 31 August 2018, the total amount classified as assets held for sale was £608,000 (2017:
£608,000), being the net book value of the property prior to its transfer to assets held for sale.

Certain subsidiary undertakings are guarantors over Senior Secured Loan Notes which are listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF Market. Under this arrangement, the assets of these subsidiary
undertakings are subject to a fixed and floating charge. The Senior Secured Loan Notes were redeemed on
25 October 2018 in conjunction with the acquisition of the Group by Jacobs Holding AG. See note 32 for further
information.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are spread across the Group’s regions. The carrying value of intangible
assets is monitored by reference to Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”). A CGU is typically a school or limited
company for non-school business units. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are discount and
growth rates. The Group considers that all CGUs operate in a similar sector being education, but acknowledge

that the countries in which the Group operates need to be considered in the calculation of discount rate. Therefore
this year’s impairment reviews adopted discount rates ranging between 9.0% and 16.3%. For all CGUs a growth
rate of 2.25% is applied with the exclusion of those in Brazil where a rate of 4.95% was used.

The Group monitors its post-tax weighted average cost of capital and those of its competitors using market data.
In considering the discount rates applied to the CGUs, the Directors have considered the relative sizes and risks
of its CGUs. The impairment reviews use a discount rate adjusted for pre-tax cash flows.

As part of the review for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill in seven schools in UK and one school in
Brazil (2017: two schools in UK) were identified as being impaired and an adjustment of £9,492,000 (2017:
£107,000) was made by the Group to write down the value of intangible consolidated goodwill.

**_Sensitivity analysis_**

Following the impairment losses recognised in certain schools and reported in tangible and intangible assets
respectively, recoverable amounts were equal to carrying amounts.

On the basis of the above, a range of sensitised trading scenarios, carried out on all impairment reviews and for a
reasonably possible range of sensitivities, the discounted future cash flows at 31 August 2018 exceeded the
valuation of tangible and intangible assets.

Impairment calculations are, however, more sensitive to changes in the discount rate. An increase of 1% in the
discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would give rise to an additional impairment charge of
£7.3m (2017: £4.9m) in the Group CGUs.

The interest in joint venture represented the Group’s contribution to the share capital of St Nicholas Preparatory
School Limited (the “joint venture”), created with a third party to manage the St Nicholas Preparatory School.

The joint venture was structured as a separate vehicle and the Group had a residual interest in the net assets. The
Group owned 50% of the share capital and the articles of association required unanimous consent amongst the
two owners for resolutions to be passed.

On 25 August 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in its joint venture, St Nicholas Preparatory
School in London, UK for a total consideration of £1.3m. The negative goodwill of £1.0m arising on acquisition
was immediately recognised in the income statement.

As at 31 August 2018, the Group had issued Senior Secured Loan Notes totalling £435m of which £60m was
issued in February 2018 at a premium of £1.95m.

The Senior Secured Loan Notes were due to mature on 15 August 2021 and carried a fixed rate of interest of
7.75%. The issue has been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF (“Multilateral Trading
Facility”).

On 25 October 2018, as part of a Group refinancing exercise in conjunction with the acquisition of the Group by
Jacobs Holding AG, the Senior Secured Loan Notes were redeemed, the Revolving Credit Facility was repaid in

£476,000).

The loans from subsidiary undertakings is a funding loan from Cognita Financing plc which carries a fixed rate
of interest of 8.25% and is repayable in August 2021.

**23 Employee benefits—Pension plans**

**Defined contribution plans**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans. The assets of these schemes are held
separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the various investment companies.

The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was £8,452,000 (2017: £7,861,000) (see note 7).

**Multi-employer defined benefit plan**

_Teachers’ Pension Scheme_

The Group participates in the TPS for its teaching staff. The defined contribution pension charge for the period
includes contributions payable to the TPS of £5,269,000 (2017 £5,369,000) and at the year end £nil (2017:
£4,000) was accrued in respect of contributions to this scheme.

The TPS is an unfunded multi-employer defined benefits pension scheme governed by the Teachers’ Pension
Scheme Regulations 2014. Members contribute on a “pay as you go” basis with contributions from members and
the employer being credited to the Exchequer. Retirement and other pension benefits are paid by public funds
provided by Parliament.

The employer contribution rate was set following scheme valuations undertaken by the Government Actuary
Department. The latest actuarial valuation of the TPS was prepared at 31 March 2012 and the valuation report,
which was published in June 2014, confirmed an employer contribution rate for the TPS of 16.4% from
1 September 2015. Employers are also required to pay a scheme administration levy of 0.08% giving a total
employer contribution rate of 16.48%. Contributors are being consulted over the proposed increase. At the time
of preparing these financial statements it was proposed that the employer contribution rate would increase from
16.48% to 23.6% with effect from September 2019.

**Property**

The property provision represents the anticipated costs of returning operating lease premises to their original
state as required by the terms of the related lease. The leases are due to expire within two to three years and,
therefore, the provision is expected to be utilised within this period. The level of provision is based upon an
annual review of the current condition of the building. The review is based upon internal and external
examinations of the property.

**Severance allowance and non-compulsory insurance**

Severance allowance is paid to certain employees in Vietnam when they terminate their employment contracts
and is estimated based on a consideration of time and services rendered by employees. The provision is
calculated on the basis of a half-month salary for each employee for each year of service with the relevant Group
company and based on basic salary levels at the balance sheet date.

The non-compulsory insurance provision represents income tax and VAT payments for non-compulsory
insurance in the Asia region. The non-compulsory insurance is considered as a taxable income and personal
income tax is estimated based on local tax rate.

**24 Provisions (continued)**

**Other**

The other provisions consist of a provision for fidelity complement in Spain and a labour litigation provision in
Brazil.

The fidelity complement is recognised as stated by the CBA in Spain. The provision covers the extra payments
that may be requested by staff if they comply with certain requirements. The level of provision has been
calculated by an actuary, and the release has been estimated over the next few years.

The labour litigation provision represents an amount relating to an ex-employee in Brazil.

During the year, the loyalty points system operating in Super Camps Limited ceased and the period available to
utilise these points has lapsed. A provision is no longer recognised.

During the year, the Company issued one additional ordinary share with nominal value of £1 and total
consideration of £7,000,000 to its immediate parent company, Cognita Midco Limited.

**Rights of share**

Ordinary shares have attached to them full voting, dividend and capital distribution rights; they do not confer any
rights of redemption.

_Merger reserve_

The merger reserve arose as a result of common control accounting upon the Company acquisition of Cognita
Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries during the year ended 31 August 2015. The merger reserve represents the
cumulative reserves of that group prior to the acquisition date.

_Equity reserve_

The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and is recognised in equity. The fair value determined at the
grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period,
based on the Group’s estimate of when the shares will vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based
vesting conditions.

_Translation reserve_

The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising since 1 September 2014, the transition
date to Adopted IFRSs, from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the
translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.

**Annual Report and Financial Statements**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**


**26 Financial instruments**

The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, equity investments and various items,
such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are
described in more detail below. In order to manage the Group’s exposure to those risks, in particular the Group’s
exposure to interest rate risk, the Group enters into a number of derivative transactions including, but not limited
to, forward currency contracts. All transactions in derivatives are undertaken to manage the risks arising from
underlying business activities and no transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange
risk, and interest rate risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are
summarised below.

**_a) Fair values of financial instruments_**

_Fair values_

The fair values of all financial assets and financial liabilities by class together with their carrying amounts shown
in the balance sheet are as follows:

_Effect of change of inputs used in fair value measurement_

The carrying amount of interest bearing trade and other receivables and trade and other payables is deemed to be
a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is determined
by reference to the quoted price for the Senior Secured Loan Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro
MTF Market.

**_b) Credit risk_**

_Financial risk management_

**_Group_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and trade receivables
and the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of these
assets.

**_b) Credit risk (continued)_**

The credit risk associated with bank balances is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies.

The principal credit risk in the group therefore arises from trade receivables, which represent outstanding fees
receivable. In order to limit the risk surrounding outstanding fees, student fees are reviewed on a regular basis in
conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.

The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date was:

The provision account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that
no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off
against trade receivables directly.

**_Company_**

The Company had no external receivables at the year end (2017: £nil) and so has no exposure to credit risk.

**_c) Liquidity risk_**

_Financial risk management_

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and by investing cash assets safely and profitably.

The Group is supported by its ultimate parent to ensure continuity of funding. In 2015, the Group secured
funding by issuing £280m of Senior Secured Loan Notes. In the year ended 31 August 2017 a further £155m was

raised through additional issuances, through private placements of Senior Secured Loan Notes. Additionally, the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility increased to £100m during the year ended 31 August 2017. Further local
financing is sourced where possible for acquisitions and developments.

On 25 October 2018, as part of a Group refinancing exercise in conjunction with the acquisition of the Group by
Jacobs Holding AG, the Senior Secured Loan Notes were redeemed, and the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility was repaid in full using the proceeds of new bank facilities totalling £652m. Local debt facilities in Hong
Kong were also settled as part of the refinancing.

The maturity of borrowings at the Balance Sheet date is set out in note 19 to the financial statements. In total, as
at 31 August 2018, the Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group had drawn borrowings of £630.9m (2017:
£515.5m), of which £561.8m (2017: £475.6m) was repayable after 31 August 2019. This included £430.4m of
Senior Secured Loan Notes due in August 2021. Following the refinancing of debt in October 2018, the Group
had drawn borrowings totalling £703.6m at the date of signing this report and committed unutilised facilities
totalling £123m. Of the total facilities available at the date of this report, £720.8m would be repayable after
31 August 2019. This includes bank loans and facilities totalling £675m with repayment dates in 2025 or beyond.

The Group has a strong working capital position as student contracts require cash payment in advance of tuition
services, generally on an annual, termly or monthly basis. Trade payables are settled on the basis of credit terms
agreed with the respective suppliers.

**26 Financial instruments (continued)**

**_d) Market risk_**

Market risk as applicable to the Group is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or
interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. These two
elements of Market risk are covered separately below.

_Market risk—Foreign exchange risk_

The Group’s results are reported in pounds sterling. Where possible, the Group seeks to manage the effect of any
exposure that may arise from the translation of the foreign currency assets by borrowing funds denominated in
the local currency of the entity it acquires, or will use hedging instruments to mitigate the exchange risk.

Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign subsidiaries, Group exposure to currency
risk at a transactional level is minimal. The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are usually carried
out in their local currency.

**_Company_**

The Company had no exposure to foreign currency risk at 31 August 2018 or at 31 August 2017.

_Sensitivity analysis—Group_

If sterling had been 10% stronger / weaker at 31 August 2018, Group equity would have decreased / increased by
£85,900 (2017: £590,036). This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had
been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

_Market risk—Interest rate risk_

The Group finances its operations through third party borrowings and in the form of Senior Secured Loan Notes
which, at the date of balance sheet, carried a fixed rate of interest of 7.75%. On 25 October 2018, following the
Group’s refinancing activities, the Senior Secured Loan Notes were redeemed in full. See note 32 for further
details.

The interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 August 2018 is shown in the
table below. The table includes trade debtors and creditors which do not attract interest but are subject to fair
value interest rate risk.

rates that are fixed for the life of the instrument.

**_d) Market risk (continued)_**

_Sensitivity analysis_

At 31 August 2018, the Group had exposure to interest rate sensitivity in respect of variable rate loans held in
Brazil and Hong Kong. In respect of these loans, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates over
the year would have increased / decreased the result for the year by £66,000 (2017: £56,000) for the loan held in
Brazil and £464,000 (2017: £58,000) for the loan held in Hong Kong.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers
the effect of all financial instruments with variable interest rates.

**_e) Capital management_**

**_Group and Company_**

The Group manages its capital to safeguard its ability to operate as a going concern and to optimise returns to
shareholders. Overdraft and revolving credit facilities will be used to finance the working capital cycle if
required.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19 after
deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and
retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.

The debt and equity balance in some parts of the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements
such as those imposed by third party loan providers. The local tax treatment is also taken into consideration when
determining the most appropriate capital structure for investments in subsidiaries.

**27 Operating leases**

Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows:

**Property** **Other** **Total** Property Other Total

leases (2017: £12,503,000).

**28 Capital Commitments**

**Group**

As at 31 August 2018, the Group had total capital commitments of £26,900,000.

In March 2018, St Nicholas Preparatory School entered into a new lease agreement to relocate the school from its
existing location. The relocation is subject to planning permission being granted. Total contractual commitment
should planning permission be granted is £10,963,000.

**28 Capital Commitments (continued)**

In December 2014, the Group entered into a promise to purchase agreement with a real estate developer to
construct a school in Chile. The development was completed and opened to students in March 2016. Under the
terms of the agreement, the Group will be required to purchase the school and the freehold property should
certain performance criteria be met, the aggregate contractual commitment at 31 August 2018 is £7,857,000
(2017: £7,141,000).

**29 Contingencies**

**Group Guarantees**

During the year ended 31 August 2015, the Group restructured its debt which involved the formation of new
companies within the Group, including subsidiary undertaking Cognita Financing plc. Cognita Financing plc
issued Senior Secured Loan Notes which are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF Market.
Cognita Bondco Parent Limited and certain subsidiary undertakings are guarantors on a senior basis. Under this
arrangement, the assets of certain Group companies are subject to a fixed and floating charge.

The total gross exposure in relation to the Senior Secured Loan Notes was £439,831,000 (2017: £379,204,000m)
including accrued interest and premiums on issue at 31 August 2018. The Guarantors also grant a senior
guarantee of a Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility agreement concurrently with the Senior Secured Loan
Notes guarantee. As at 31 August 2018, the total exposure to Revolving Credit Facility was £53,093,900 (2017:
£32,794,400). The Group also guarantees the loan facilities and deferred consideration in Brazil, Chile and Hong
Kong, with a total exposure of £120,314,000m (2017: £99,952,000m).

On 25 October 2018, the Senior Secured Loan Notes were redeemed in full. Also on this date, the Revolving
Credit Facility was settled in full. The Hong Kong local debt facility was repaid on 26 October 2018. See note 32
for more information.

**Reinstatement of leased land**

The Group is disclosing a contingent liability in relation to reinstatement costs of leasehold land on which it has
constructed school buildings. The terms in the lease contract provide the landlord with an option of reinstating
the leased land to its original preconstruction condition.

It has been estimated that the maximum liability at 31 August 2018 should a reinstatement be required would be
£6,571,000 (2017: £6,670,000). This estimated contingent liability represents the cost of demolition of the entire
area of construction including substructure, extraction of piles, back filling to original levels and re-turfing.

Management have reviewed the contract from a legal perspective and considered other relevant factors in
determining the likely outcome on lease expiry. As a consequence of this review, it has been concluded that
whilst a requirement for reinstatement is possible upon expiry of the lease, it is not probable and therefore no
provision should be recognised in this respect.

**Litigation**

The Group received claims in respect of a potential litigation associated with the criminal conduct of a former
teacher at Southbank International School. The Group maintains insurance cover and has been advised such
cover will be adequate to cover the full amount of any potential claims.

**Tax claims**

The Group has received assessments from HMRC in the aggregate amount of £1,534,000 (2017: £1,280,000)
with respect to PAYE and NI in connection with the operation of a former management GSOP in the four
accounting periods ended 31 August 2010 to 2013. The net exposure arising from the assessment is deemed to be
£555,000 (2017: £500,000). The Group has appealed these assessments on the basis of guidance from our
advisors and no provision has been made.

**32 Post balance sheet events**

**_Acquisition of Cognita Group_**

On 25 October 2018, the Cognita Group was sold by its previous owners, KKR European Fund III LP and Bregal

economic beneficiary of which is the Jacobs Foundation. The Jacobs Foundation is a non-profit, charity
organisation with the exclusive aim to improve the lives of young people around the world.

The acquisition of the Group has prompted a refinancing of the majority of the Group’s debt with new bank
facilities being drawn on 25 October 2018 totalling £652,000,000. This enabled the group to settle the Senior
Secured Loan Notes, Revolving Credit Facilities and Forward Currency Contracts, along with local debt in Hong
Kong.

**_Acquisition of Colegio Europeo de Madrid, Spain_**

On 6 November 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of 90% of the Colegio Europeo de Madrid, a

students with a capacity of c. 1,000. The acquisition was funded by a further £1,500,000 of bank debt from the
Group’s new facilities.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**33 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are set out and described in note 1, the Directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.

**Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately
below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

_Fair value of assets and liabilities attributable to business combinations_

All business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 which involves recording all the assets and liabilities
of the acquired entity at their fair value as at the date of acquisition. As part of this exercise, significant
judgement is needed to determine the valuation of the separable intangibles acquired in the business combination.
The judgements involve determining the types of intangibles which exist, their expected useful economic lives,
the future cash flows expected to be generated from the assets and the appropriate discount rate to use. The total
value of other intangibles recognised during the year ending 31 August 2018 was £11,290,000 (2017:
£7,756,000). The impact of making different judgements regarding these intangible assets would be to increase
or decrease goodwill by the equivalent amount.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year, are discussed below.

_Share based payments_

In accordance with IFRS 2, share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The valuation of
the share based payments is performed by an independent third party and involves the use of some significant
estimates. The key estimate which has a material impact on the resulting valuation of the share based payments is
the underlying equity valuation of the Group. This has been estimated by management and leads to a total
valuation of the shares issued during the year of £22,386,000 (2017: nil). The resulting charge in the income
statement for the year ending 31 August 2018 was £14,793,000 (2017: £245,000). The valuation of the share
based payments is extremely sensitive to changes in the equity valuation and a reasonably possible change in the
EV/EBITDA multiple of +/- 0.5x would cause the share based payment valuation to range from £20,740,000 to
£24,270,000.

_Impairment of goodwill_

The Group is required to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually. This requires the Group to
calculate the value in use of each CGU to which goodwill has been allocated by estimating its future cash flows
and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Management’s estimation of the future cash flows of each CGU is
based on the Group’s long term plan, adjusted to remove development capex and the positive results impact of
this spend. Discount rates are specific to each country of operation. The total goodwill impairment charge for the
year was £9,492,000 (2017: £107,000).

**Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2017**

**Strategic report**

The Directors submit the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group (the “Group”) for the year ended 31 August 2017.

The Group is a leading global operator of private-pay K-12 schools. The Directors are pleased with the
performance during the year to 31 August 2017 which was in line with expectations. At the year end, the Group
operated 67 (2016: 67) schools across Europe, Asia and Latin America with an average total capacity of 45,140
(2016: 43,544) places and a total average enrolment of 35,286 (2016: 33,595) FTE students. The Group opened
its 68th school in Hong Kong in September 2017, adding 400 additional seats of capacity on opening which will
have increased to 800 by January 2018.

The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cognita Midco Limited, a company registered in England and
Wales. Cognita Topco Limited, a company registered in Jersey and incorporated under Companies (Jersey) Law
1999, is the immediate parent company of Cognita Midco Limited, and the ultimate parent company of the
Group.

Cognita Topco Limited is owned by The Bregal Fund III LP and KKR European Fund III LP who each hold 50%
of the issued share capital. The audited, consolidated financial statements of Cognita Topco Limited are available
to the public by application to the registered office of that company, or from Companies House with the financial
statements of the immediate parent company.

Cognita Financing plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company was incorporated on 3 July 2015, with the
purpose of issuing debt in the form of Senior Secured Loan Notes (the “Notes”) on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange—Euro MTF (“Multilateral Trading Facility”). In accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured
Loan Notes indenture, the Company is required to prepare consolidated financial statements.

**Principal activity and review of the year**

The principal activity of the Company is to act in the capacity of a Group financing company. The principal
activity of the Group during the year was the operation of private-pay K-12 schools and related education and
wider learning activities.

**Our Strategy**

We consistently focus on the Group’s objective to maintain our position as a leading global operator of
private-pay K-12 schools. Our principal strategies are to deliver high quality education, leverage our global
platform and reputation, maximise operational and financial performance and continue expansion and operation
in selected attractive and scalable markets.

**Results and performance**

The results of the Group for the year are set out on F-88 to F-94.

Students, revenue and EBITDA for the year ended 31 August are disclosed below.

“EBITDA” means Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation.

“Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA before impairment, depreciation and amortisation of other intangibles and
excluding the joint venture portion of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA can be split into underlying and
non-underlying components.

“Non-underlying” means items of income or expenditure which are disclosed separately in order to provide
comparability between periods. The items of income or expenditure which are designated as being

On 25 August 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in its joint venture, St Nicholas Preparatory
School Limited in London, UK. Consequently, Group Adjusted EBITDA (including 100% of joint venture
Adjusted EBITDA) is considered the most relevant metric for information purposes.

Student numbers increased (including the impact of acquisitions) by 5.0% in the year, with Europe growing by
4.3%, Asia by 5.9% and Latin America by 5.3%. The Europe student growth was partially offset by a decrease in
student numbers in Chilton Cantelo, Cranbrook (closed in the year ended 31 August 2016) and Sackville (sold in
the year ended 31 August 2017) schools in the United Kingdom. Asia student growth was mostly driven by the
Dusit acquisition in Thailand in 2016 and continued growth in Stamford American School in Singapore and in
ISHCMC in Vietnam. The growth of 5.3% in Latin America is largely due to the ongoing growth in the Chile
schools with new capacity and the bilingual programme continuing to drive enrolments.

Group revenue (including 100% of the St Nicholas joint venture) increased from £330.9m in 2016 to £389.7m in
2017, an increase of 17.8% or 8.6% on a constant currency basis. Revenue attributable to new acquisitions during
the year ended 31 August 2017 represented 8.6% of the increase on a constant currency basis, with the remainder
due to the organic increase in student numbers and annual fee inflation.

Regional Group Adjusted EBITDA grew by 19.2% (8.0% on a constant currency basis) and represents a margin
of 21.8% of revenue (2016: 21.5%). Much of this increase was derived from organic growth of 13.2% in the Asia
region driven by a strong growth in all countries in the region utilising available capacity. The Asia Regional
Adjusted EBITDA grew 29.9% (13.9% on a constant currency basis) on revenues that grew by 23.5% (9.3% on a
constant currency basis) in the same period.

The 17.7% organic growth rate in Latin America, on a constant currency basis, was driven by a 0.5ppt
improvement in the utilisation rates from 76.4% to 76.9% in the year ended 31 August 2017. The improvement in
EBITDA has been most notable in Chile where a new bilingual programme continues to grow and has led to
improved margins.

Europe Regional Adjusted EBITDA of £26.5m fell 1.2% (fell 18.3% on an organic basis) during the year, driven
by lower EBITDA in the UK as a result of targeted investment in the educational provision and higher national
insurance contributions. The EBITDA in Spain was impacted by two additional sites in Madrid for Hastings
school which will drive growth in future years.

Group central costs grew 12.4% to £11.0m in the year ended 31 August 2017. This increase was primarily due to
the full year impact following the transition of the executive management team.

**Year ended 31 August 2017**

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Loss for the year before taxation**

The Group’s loss before tax was £17.8m (2016: £32.9m) for the year ended 31 August 2017, which was in line
with management’s expectations and reflective of the ongoing investment in growing the business. The £15.1m
improvement in loss before taxation was largely attributable to a £12.6m increase in operating profit and a £3.2m
decrease in the net finance expense.

**Capital expenditure**

During the year, the Group invested £134.0m in capital expenditure (2016: £124.3m) and £2.5m (2016: £1.2m) in
software. The capital expenditure reported in the year represents amounts spent on the regular renewal of estate,
along with amounts invested in the expansion plans of the Group’s existing portfolio of schools, along with the
significant investments in the Early Learning Village in Singapore and the c. £20.0m refurbishment cost for the
new Hong Kong school.

Amounts invested in development capital represented £116.8m (2016: £108.0m) in total compared to operating
capital expenditure of £17.2m (2016: £16.3m). Operating capital expenditure includes investment in ensuring
schools maintain their standards and compliance with all regulations, whilst development capital expenditure
represents investment made to expand capacity at the Group’s schools and for construction and development of
other facilities which do not directly result in capacity expansion.

**Developments during the year**

**Europe**

**_Acquisition of The English Montessori School, Madrid_**

On 6 September 2016, the Group acquired 100% shareholding in The English Montessori School, a school based
in Madrid, Spain. The consideration was funded by a drawdown on the Revolving Credit Facility. The school is
an independent British school offering education to students aged 3-18 years. The school had c. 790 students at
the date of acquisition, with a current capacity of c. 1,000.

**_Disposal of Sackville school, Kent_**

On 27 January 2017, the Group disposed of Sackville school in the United Kingdom. The school was sold as a
going concern and is expected to continue trading under new ownership. Cognita has retained the freehold
interest in the school property. The property has been leased to the purchaser for a 25 year term and includes an
option to buy. For accounting purposes, the lease is treated as a finance lease and has triggered the transfer of the
property from tangible fixed assets to finance lease receivables to the value of £3.8m.

**_Sale and leaseback_**

On 1 March 2017, the Group completed a ground rent sale and leaseback of freehold properties at four UK
schools. The freehold interest of Breaside Preparatory School, Clifton Lodge Preparatory School, Duncombe
School and Long Close School were sold for consideration of £12.7m. The purchaser has simultaneously granted
Cognita 150 year leases over the properties.

At the expiry of the leases, Cognita Schools Limited will have the option to buy back the freehold interest for £1
per property.

The proceeds of the transaction were used to partially repay the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility, enhancing

incurred in the year ended 31 August 2017.

**_Construction of new campus in Vietnam_**

Construction is on track to complete in December 2017 on a 900 seat campus which will house the secondary
school of the International School Ho Chi Minh City (ISHCMC), doubling the capacity of the school. This is a
USD 16.2m (c. £12m) investment by the Group which is jointly funded with a local developer, and will open in
January 2018. It will allow ISHCMC to continue to grow enrolments which currently stand at c. 1,100.

**_Funding secured to support Group growth_**

On 4 October 2016, an additional £45m of Senior Secured Loan Notes (the “Notes”) were issued via a private
placement at a premium of £2m to par value. This additional funding followed a £20m increase to the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility on 19 September 2016, taking the total facility to £100m.

The Group issued an additional £50m of Notes on 8 May 2017 via a private placement. These Notes, which carry
the same maturity and fixed interest rate of 7.75% were issued under the same indenture as the initial issuance. A
premium of £2.25m to par value was recognised upon the issuance of these instruments.

The proceeds of the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Group’s existing Revolving
Credit Facilities and to pay any related accrued interest, transaction costs and expenses, with any remaining
amounts to be used for general corporate purposes.

The Group continues to monitor and review its exposure to foreign exchange risk in relation to the Notes denoted
in pounds sterling.

**_British referendum on Europe_**

As a UK based organisation with global operations, management recognise that the Brexit vote may have
implications for the Group in financial, operational and regulatory areas. Whilst the timing and nature of the
UK’s separation from the EU remain unclear, management have identified some areas of potential business
impact which they will keep under review as events unfold.

_Currency exposure: Fluctuations in exchange rates will impact Group results which are reported in pounds_
sterling. Approximately 64% of Group revenue, 80% of Group EBITDA and 92% of Group capital expenditure
are denominated in foreign currency. The Group has entered into forward exchange contracts in respect of the
Notes as disclosed in the final section of this report.

_Student and staffing recruitment and retention: The potential impact on London’s status as a financial centre may_
affect demand for international schools. However, the weakening of the pound sterling against other major
currencies may make Cognita’s UK independent schools more competitive internationally as tuition fees become
more affordable for foreign families looking to educate their children in the UK. A further consideration is that
attracting and retaining students and teachers from the EU may become more difficult if visa entry requirements
become more stringent.

_Regulatory changes: Cognita will be working closely with the National Association of British Schools in Spain,_
the Council of British International School and the British Council to review the impact of Brexit, if any, on the
use of British qualifications for Spanish university entry and on Spanish students applying to British universities.

Management’s view is that the Group’s diverse global portfolio and the robust nature of the education sector will
provide resilience against the uncertainties faced during the Brexit transition period.

**_Serious Case Review_**

The Serious Case Review related to the criminal activity of a former teacher at Southbank International School
was published on 20 January 2016. The Review recognised that significant progress had been made at Southbank
and six key areas were identified for further focus and improvement. Cognita has invested considerable time and
resource at Southbank since the date of the Review and has made strong progress in the key areas of governance,
cultural change, compliance with statutory guidance, internal audit, partnering with the local authority children’s
safeguarding board and encouragement of reporting by pupils and children. The publication of the Serious Case
Review has not had a material adverse effect on our enrolments or retention of students at the three Southbank
schools.

**Cognita Bondco Parent Limited**
**Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2017**

**Strategic report (continued)**

The Group continues to invest in safeguarding and has a governance model which combines both internal and
external review in every school. Since implementing a new approach, Cognita has been identified as a leader in
this area. It is notable that in Cognita’s school inspections since October 2015, all schools have been deemed
compliant and all but one have scored Outstanding for Welfare, Health and Safety, including Southbank
International School.

**_Catalonia independence referendum_**

The Group has one school in Catalonia, Spain, the British School of Barcelona. The political situation in Spain is
being closely monitored and steps have been taken to ensure continuity of operations should the situation
escalate. Management do not expect the situation to have a material impact on the Group.

**_System Implementations_**

NetSuite, a global ERP system, has been successfully introduced into all regions during the year. NetSuite will
provide additional functionality, visibility and enable improved cost control management going forward.

The implementation of Group wide systems for human resources and admissions is also underway.

**Future developments**

The Group will continue to invest in its existing schools, with some strategic development projects planned for
the year ended 31 August 2018 and beyond. The Group will continue to develop opportunities in all regions.

**Statement of Going Concern**

The Group and Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect their future development,
performance and position are set out in this report. The financial position of the Group and Company, its cash
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out in the financial statements. The Group and
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital are described in note 1 to the financial
statements. Further information on the Group’s capital management can be found in note 25 to the financial
statements.

Details of the Group and Company’s financial risk management objectives, its financial instruments and hedging
activities; and exposures to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are set out below and in further detail in note
25 to the financial statements.

During the year ended 31 August 2015, the Group refinanced substantially all of its debt, with the exception of
debt held by Group companies in Brazil and Chile. Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued and the proceeds
were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness and related costs. The Notes mature on 15 August 2021. As part
of this refinancing arrangement, deep discounted bonds previously issued by Cognita Topco Limited were
collapsed via a capitalisation.

On 4 October 2016, an additional £45m of Notes were issued at a premium of £2.0m to par value. This additional
funding followed a £20m increase to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended 31 August
2016, and a further increase of £20m in September 2016, which in aggregate extended the facility to £100m.

The Group issued an additional £50.0m of Notes on 8 May 2017 via a private placement. These Notes, which
carry the same maturity and fixed interest rate of 7.75% were issued under the same indenture as the initial
issuance. A premium of £2.25m to par value was recognised upon the issuance of these instruments.

The Directors have performed a review of the Group’s finances and have a reasonable expectation that the
business has adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future and will be able to support the repayment
of its debt facilities and related interest payments. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

**Cognita Bondco Parent Limited**
**Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2017**

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Controlling parties and ultimate parent undertaking**

The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is Cognita Midco Limited, a company incorporated in England
and Wales. The ultimate parent undertaking is Cognita Topco Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey which
is jointly controlled by The Bregal Fund III LP and Crimson Cayman Holding Limited, which itself is controlled
by KKR European Fund III LP (see note 30).

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties**

The management of the business and the execution of the Group’s strategy are subject to a number of risks. Risks
are reviewed by the Board of Directors and appropriate processes put in place to monitor and mitigate them. The
key business risks for the Group are described in more detail below:

**Child protection and safeguarding**

The Group may be liable for certain acts that affect the health and safety of students and staff at schools, or
which breach the duty of care towards students, which may harm the Group’s reputation and adversely affect the
business and financial results. To mitigate this risk, the Group has policies and procedures in place which are
aligned to regulatory standards and are globally consistent.

**Authorisation to operate as an education provider**

The Group requires authorisation to operate as an education provider from the relevant government department
for education in each country in which it operates. The Group also needs to comply with the policies, laws and
regulations for school operations in each country and obtain the necessary licences, permits, visas, accreditations,
certifications and other authorisations for operating our schools and employing our teachers. The Group monitors
compliance with such policies, laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

**Health and safety**

The prevention of injury to employees, students, parents and other customers in the Group is of utmost
importance. The Group has clear policies and procedures which are in place and aligned to regulatory standards.

**Market forces**

Market forces have implications on pricing, demand for the Group’s services and ultimately the Group’s return
on investment. The Group invests in market research across all regions to ensure that it has a detailed and current
knowledge and understanding of the sector in which it operates and the related risks arising from market forces.

To minimise the possible impact of market forces, the Group focuses on delivering educational excellence, to
ensure that Cognita schools are competitive in the private schools market, even when market forces cause
unfavourable economic conditions.

**Political environment**

The Group is subject to the political conditions of each country in which it operates. Political events and unrest
can lead to issues such as sudden changes in laws, regulations, taxes and price volatility. Political unrest can also
impact the environments in which the school operates and destabilise a country, impacting on the performance of
schools. The Group monitors political risk to ensure compliance with local requirements and minimises exposure
to changes through maintaining and modifying appropriate business procedures as necessary.

During the year the Group has maintained and reviewed its anti-bribery and corruption policy which
encompasses existing controls as well as additional procedures. Anti-bribery and corruption procedures are
reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure continued compliance.

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

**ICT systems and infrastructure**

The Directors understand the importance of ICT within the business. The Group has controls and disaster
recovery plans in place in case of a significant system failure. The Group is also committed to enhancing the
current provision of ICT systems through ongoing investment into the business, including investment in a new
ERP solution, HR system and CRM during the year.

**Cyber risk and data protection**

The Group collects and retains personal data and unauthorised disclosure of this data due to a systems failure or
otherwise could have a damaging effect on the business. The Group has policies and procedures in place which
are aligned to regulatory standards and are well prepared for the introduction of the EU General Data Protection
Regulation.

**Human resources**

Retention of high quality staff both educational and non-educational is critical to the success of the business. The
Group’s employment policies, remuneration and benefits packages are regularly reviewed to ensure we can
attract and retain the best staff.

**Supporting growth**

The continued growth and financial performance of the Group depends on having the right resources in place.
Consequently, the Group continually assesses the needs of each region to ensure that the Group’s infrastructure
continues to expand in line with growth to ensure the necessary resources for current and future development.

A key focus of the Group is to ensure that newly acquired schools are integrated efficiently and effectively. This
enables minimal disruption, continuity in educational provision and access to key improvements and benefits
which membership of the Group can offer.

**Financial capital risk**

The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, equity investments and various items,
such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to facilitate the Group’s operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are
described in more detail below.

In order to manage the Group’s exposure to those risks, in particular the Group’s exposure to exchange rate risk,
the Group enters into a number of derivative transactions including foreign currency forward contracts.

All transactions in derivatives are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities and
no transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, interest
rate risk and credit risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are
summarised below.

**Macroeconomic environment**

Our operations are affected by the general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we operate.
These macroeconomic conditions are monitored on an ongoing basis along with the impact on our current and

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

future financial performance. Risks identified during the year included the potential impact of the British
referendum on the EU, slower than historical growth in the Asia region, driven by global macroeconomic
environment changes, and political developments in Catalonia, Spain.

To date, we have seen limited impact of these factors on our financial performance due to the importance of
education spend for parents and the general stability of the markets in which we operate, as well as our focus on
controlling our costs. Whilst for these reasons management believes our revenue and profitability are relatively
resilient to fluctuations as a result of macroeconomic conditions, we will continue to monitor developments and
the potential related risks.

**Liquidity risk**

The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and by investing cash assets safely and profitably.

The Group is supported by its ultimate parent, whose policy has been to ensure continuity of funding. In 2015,
the Group secured funding by issuing £280m of Senior Secured Loan Notes. In October 2016 and May 2017, the
Group issued an additional £45m and £50m respectively of Loan Notes through a private placement.
Additionally, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility was increased by £20m to £100m during the year ended
31 August 2017.

This funding will provide sufficient liquidity to the Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group through to the
maturity of the Senior Secured Loan Notes on 15 August 2021.

The maturity of borrowings at the Balance Sheet date is set out in note 19 to the financial statements. In total, the
Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group has access to committed borrowing facilities of £515.5m (2016:
£402.7m), of which £296.3m mature beyond 2020.

The Group is also able to mitigate liquidity risk through short-term and flexible overdraft facilities.

**Foreign exchange risk**

The Group’s results are reported in pounds sterling. Where possible, the Group seeks to manage the effect of any
exposure that may arise from the translation of the foreign currency assets by borrowing funds denominated in
the local currency of the entity it acquires, or will use hedging instruments to mitigate the exchange risk.

Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign subsidiaries, Group exposure to currency
risk at a transactional level is minimal. The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are usually carried
out in local currency.

The Group reassessed its hedging arrangements following the Group refinancing to cover its sterling exposure on
the Senior Secured Loan Notes by entering into forward currency contracts. Further details are disclosed in
note 21 of the financial statements.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through fixed rate Senior Secured Loan Notes, bank borrowings and
Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its bank borrowings is managed
by the use of hedging or fixed interest rate instruments. It is the Group’s policy to use fixed interest rate
instruments or to use fixed rate hedging instruments to fix interest rates on at least 50% of its bank borrowings.

**Credit risk**

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The credit risk associated with cash is
limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The
principal credit risk therefore arises from its trade receivables.

**Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law they have elected to prepare both the group and the parent company financial statements in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that
period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:

 - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

 - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;

 - state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

 - assess the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern; and

 - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group and Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and
Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Cognita Bondco Parent Limited**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (the “Company”) for the year ended
31 August 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance
Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Statement of Changes
in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.

In our opinion:

 - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s
affairs as at 31 August 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;

 - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

 - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted
by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

 - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and
are independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**Going concern**

We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is
inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. We have
nothing to report in these respects.

**Strategic Report and Directors’ Report**

The Directors are responsible for the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors’ report and, in doing so, consider whether,
based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work:

 - we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report;

 - in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

 - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

 - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

 - certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

 - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (continued)**

**Directors’ responsibilities**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on F-85, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

**The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**1 Accounting policies**

**_General information_**

Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cognita Midco Limited. The ultimate controlling party
is Cognita Topco Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey which is owned by The Bregal Fund III LP and
KKR European Fund III LP who each own 50% of the issued share capital.

The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) during the period
was the operation of private-pay K-12 schools and related education activities. These financial statements are for
this Company and the Group.

**_Basis of preparation_**

Both the Company and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). On
publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is
taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income
statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of the following assets and
liabilities which are stated at their fair value in accordance with the relevant Adopted IFRSs:

 - Derivative financial instruments

 - Liabilities for equity-settled share based payments.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all years
presented in these consolidated financial statements.

Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on
the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed
in note 31.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s interest in its jointly controlled entity. Control exists when the
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Total comprehensive
income is attributed to non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit
balance.

The governance of a jointly controlled entity is established by contractual agreement which requires the
venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. Therefore, the Group has joint
control of the entities’ activities. The equity method is used to account for the jointly controlled entity. The
Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity
movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint
control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.

**_Going concern_**

The Group has continued to expand both organically and via acquisitions during the year. The growth has been
funded from operating cash flow and short and long term borrowings (see note 19). Future growth will be funded
from suitable financing arrangements as well as cash flows generated from operations.

The information disclosed in the Strategic Report explains the Directors’ assessment of risk within the Group.
The Group is structured to enable sharing of resources where possible, including banking arrangements and
liquid assets between Group companies. The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage these business
risks in the current economic climate.

The Directors have performed a review of the Group and have a reasonable expectation that the business has
adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

The principal accounting policies are set out below. They have remained unchanged from the previous year.

**_Foreign currency_**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated
financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling,
which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Group.

i) Foreign currency transactions

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.

At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the income statement, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.

ii) Foreign operations

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign
operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to the Group’s
presentational currency at foreign exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. The revenues and
expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising are reported as an item
of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve, attributed to non-controlling interests
as appropriate.

Exchange differences arising from monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the
settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net
investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Classification of financial instruments_**

The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories:

 - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

 - Held to maturity financial assets

 - Loans and receivables

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
substance of the contractual arrangement.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised as proceeds received, net of direct issue
costs.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.

**_Non-derivative financial instruments_**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, cash and cash
equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other interest bearing loans and
borrowings.

**_Investments in equity securities_**

Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the parent company accounts.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. In the cash flow statement, cash and cash
equivalents includes bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any impairment losses. Due to their shortterm nature, the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. A provision for
impairment of receivables is applied where there is empirical evidence that the Group will not be able to recover
the contracted cash inflows. When certainty is obtained that a receivable is not recoverable, the specific
receivable is written off.

**_Trade and other payables_**

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value
of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

**_Interest-bearing borrowings_**

Senior Secured Loan Notes and bank borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Where amortised cost using straight line amortisation
approximates the outcome under the effective interest method, the straight line method is adopted.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Derivative financial instruments and hedging_**

The Group uses forward contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange and
interest rates of bank borrowings. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The fair value of
interest rate swaps are based on Mark to Market values provided by the issuing financial institutions. These
values are mid-market levels as at close of business on the balance sheet date. The gain or loss on
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group has not adopted hedge
accounting in relation to these instruments.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are
classified as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land
is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at
an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at
inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, using the
straight-line method over the useful economic life of that asset. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful
lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Freehold buildings – 20 to 60 years
Short leasehold land and buildings – the remaining life of the lease
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 1 to 10 years
Computer equipment – 2 to 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted if
appropriate.

Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. Upon completion the asset will be transferred into the
relevant category of property, plant and equipment and will be depreciated over its estimated useful life.

**_Business combinations_**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.

When the Group obtains control of a previously jointly controlled entity, the transaction is recorded as a disposal
of the investment in the jointly controlled entity and the acquisition of a subsidiary. The profit or loss on disposal
of the jointly controlled entity is the fair value of the original holding less its carrying amount.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

 - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

 - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Business combinations (continued)_**

 - the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

 - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are
expensed as incurred.

On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both
present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of
liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net
assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value at
the acquisition date.

**_Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests_**

Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for
as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and, therefore, no goodwill is recognised as a result of
such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net
assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which
non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.

**_Assets held for sale_**

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally
through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

**_Goodwill and Intangible assets_**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Where the total of consideration
transferred and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income
statement.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill at fair value
if those assets are separately identifiable and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of
intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and intangibles with an indefinite useful life are not
amortised but are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Capitalised software and other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.

**_Goodwill and Intangible assets (continued)_**

The estimated useful lives of other intangibles are as follows:

Computer software – 3 years
Customer contracts – average tenure of a student at relevant school
School licences – over the length of the licence
Brands – 20 years
Favourable leases – over the remaining length of the lease

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle
and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs in bringing them to their existing
location and condition.

**_Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets_**

_Financial assets (including receivables)_

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence
indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a
negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

_Non-financial assets_

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill is assessed
for impairment at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition and subsequently at each reporting date.

Indications of impairment are identified by reviewing events or changes in circumstance which suggest that the
carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount
is estimated. The recoverable amount is deemed to be the higher of net realisable value (fair value less costs to
sell) and value in use.

Value in use is calculated by discounting estimated future post-tax cash flows to their present value using a
post-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset.

The discount rate applied is based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group’s operations in
the country the asset sits. Estimated future cash flows are based on Board approved budgets which represent our
best estimate of future performance, supported by historical trends, known operating margins and achievable
growth or cost saving targets. An inflationary growth rate of 2.25% was used to extrapolate beyond the most
recent forecasts for all regions with the exclusion of Brazil where 4.95% was used, representing the inflation rate
for the business based on latest economic information.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash
inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).

The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cashgenerating units (“CGU”). Impairment testing is performed at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for

internal reporting purposes. Therefore a CGU represents an individual school or group of schools purchased as
one business acquisition transaction. No individual CGU’s are considered significant in comparison to the total
carrying value of goodwill.

Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised
in the income statement. Impairment losses in respect of a CGU are initially allocated against the carrying
amount of goodwill allocated to the units and then subsequently against the carrying amounts of other assets
within the CGU.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are irreversible. Impairment losses recognised against other
assets can be subsequently reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are therefore assessed at each reporting date for
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that
the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable for services or goods provided in the
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is recognised based on
the following criteria:

 - it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the Group

 - the revenue can be measured reliably

 - the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measure reliably

Revenue is generated from the provision of educational services and the sale of related services and goods. The
recognition of material revenue streams is detailed below:

 - **Tuition fees**

These are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the service provision. The fee will be recognised
over the full 12 months of that academic year. Annual fee rates are used as the basis for calculating the monthly
fee recognised.

 - **Application/enrolment fees**

These fees relate to the processing of new applications and where successful, a formal offer of a place within one
of the Group’s schools is made. These fees are recognised at the point at which an application is processed.

 - **Development/facility fees/capital levies**

This is a fee for the provision of the facilities made available to a student during their tenure at a Group school.
These fees are dependent upon the provision of tuition services and are therefore directly linked. The revenue is
recognised over the expected tenure of a student within the school. The expected tenure is considered on a school
by school basis and this estimate is reconsidered on an annual basis.

 - **Holiday camp revenue**

Fees payable for holiday camp services are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the service
provision.

**_Revenue (continued)_**

 - **Other revenue**

This represents a number of income streams including fees for information technology, transportation, clubs,
trips and income from the sale of books, uniforms and canteen sales. Revenue is recognised upon the provision of
services or upon sale of goods.

All revenue is presented net of discounts, the recognition of which is consistent with the related revenue stream.

**_Employee benefits_**

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.

_Multi-employer plans_

The Group participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (“the TPS”), in respect of certain
teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan and it is not possible for the Group to use
defined benefit accounting as sufficient information is not available. Accordingly, no provision can be made for
any under or over provision of funding within the plan as required under IAS 19 and the scheme is therefore
accounted for in the same way as if it were defined contribution. For further detail on the TPS see note 22.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of
past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

_Share based payment transactions_

Share based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own
equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment transactions, regardless of how the
equity instruments are obtained by the Group.

Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the
grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the
determination of the fair value of equity-settled share based transactions are set out in note 9.

The fair-value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as
a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates,
if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with
the corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.

**_Provisions_**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as
a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Provisions (continued)_**

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount
is the present value of those cash flows.

**_Expenses_**

_Operating lease payments_

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total
lease expense.

_Finance lease payments_

Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding
liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

_Financing income and expenses_

Financing expenses comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance
leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions,
and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see foreign currency accounting
policy). Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset
that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Financing
income comprise interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.

Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest
method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments
is established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

**_Taxation_**

Tax on the loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences
are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised.

**_Non-underlying items_**

Non-underlying items are disclosed separately in order to provide comparability between periods. They comprise
income and expenditure which is not related to the Group’s core operating activities, including acquisition and
business exploration costs, restructuring costs, impairment of assets, profit and loss on disposal of fixed assets,
school pre-opening losses and non-cash share based payment expense.

**Standards issued but not yet effective**

The material new standards and interpretations that are endorsed by the EU but not yet effective up to the date of
issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below and will be adopted where applicable when they
become effective.

IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and
liabilities and replaces the guidance provided by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’
with effect for the year ending 31 August 2019. Early application is permitted. The key change for the Group
arising from IFRS 9 is in the requirement to use an expected loss model for recognition of bad debt provisions
across the whole Group, however, the impact on the Group is not expected to be material.

IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ deals with revenue recognition and focuses on the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and its related cash flows. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and
IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ with effect for the year ending 31 August 2019. Early application is permitted.
The Group expects to see changes to the timing of revenue recognition as a result of the standard with tuition and
associated fees being recognised on a term time basis. This will lead to a one-off increase in equity on adoption,
however, annual revenue will not change materially.

IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ considers the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and also deals with
the disclosure of useful information relating to leasing activities. The standard replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and a
key change is that most operating leases held by lessees will be accounted for on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 is
effective for the year ending 31 August 2020, with early adoption permitted, as long as the standard is not
adopted prior to IFRS 15. On adoption, a one-off decrease in equity will be recognised along with higher
EBITDA, offset by higher interest costs.

Gearing will increase as a result of new operating lease liabilities, however, this will be offset by equal and
opposite right of use assets.

The consequences of the adoption of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 is currently being considered in detail by
management and the full impact has not yet been determined.

**2 Acquisitions of subsidiaries**

**_Acquisitions in the current period_**

During the year the Group completed four acquisitions. The English Montessori School S.A. in Madrid, Spain,
The Bushcraft Company Limited in the UK, Avondale Grammar School Pte Ltd in Singapore and St Nicholas
Preparatory School Limited in the UK.

The Group incurred costs related to these acquisitions of £434,000 relating to legal and financial due diligence
and transaction costs during the year ended 31 August 2017 (2016: £932,000). These costs have been included in
non-underlying costs in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Goodwill recognised on acquisition is mainly attributable to the value of synergies of integrating the operations
of the business with those of the Group as well as the skills and knowledge of the employees of the schools
acquired. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

**_Acquisitions in the current period (continued)_**

Cash outflows from acquisitions are reflected in the Consolidated Cash flow Statement on F-94. Cash outflows
relating to acquisitions are shown net of cash acquired and include deferred consideration paid in respect of prior
year investments.

If all of the acquisitions had occurred on 1 September 2016, the Group revenue would have been £392,970,000
and the Group net loss would been £27,966,000. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that
the fair value adjustment that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition
occurred on 1 September 2016.

More detail is provided on each acquisition below:

**The English Montessori School, Spain**

On 6 September 2016, the Group acquired a 100% shareholding in The English Montessori School S.A. for a
total consideration of €11.4m.

The school is an independent British curriculum school located in the outskirts of Madrid, Spain, offering
education to students aged 3-18 years. The school had c. 790 students at the date of acquisition, with a current
capacity of c. 1,000. The acquisition of the school expands the Group’s educational offering in Madrid and
provides a good opportunity to grow student numbers in Spain.

In the period from acquisition to 31 August 2017, The English Montessori School contributed £6,098,000 of
revenue and £332,000 profit to the consolidated net loss for the year.

**The Bushcraft Company**

On 12 May 2017, the Group acquired a 100% shareholding in The Bushcraft Company Limited (“Bushcraft”)
along with its holding companies Educational Activity Group Limited and Educational Activity Limited, for
consideration of £5.2m. The consideration includes deferred payments, of which a small amount is contingent.
The expected liability of c. £1.0m is due to crystallise in three years.

Bushcraft offers residential school trips, taking students aged 7-18 into UK woodland settings and giving them a
back-to-nature experience. The purpose of the acquisition was to compliment our educational offering in the UK
market.

In the period from acquisition to 31 August 2017, Bushcraft contributed £2,927,000 of revenue and £931,000 net
profit to the consolidated net loss for the year.

On 13 July 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Avondale Grammar School Pte Ltd
(“Avondale”), an independent Australian curriculum school in Singapore, for total consideration of SGD 10.5m
(c. £5.9m).

The purpose of the acquisition was to obtain full control of the Australian curriculum market in Singapore, as the
Group already owns the only other school in the country who provide this. At the date of acquisition, the school
had 250 students.

**St Nicholas Preparatory School**

On 25 August 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in its joint venture, St Nicholas Preparatory
School Limited in London, UK for a total consideration of £1.3m. Prior to the acquisition, the Group owned 50%
of the company and this increase in shareholding has been treated as a stepped acquisition in line with IFRS 3
resulting in the disposal of the joint venture and the acquisition of a 100% owned subsidiary. Negative goodwill
of £1.0m arising on the acquisition was immediately recognised in the income statement within acquisition and
business exploration costs (see note 5). This was offset by a loss on disposal of the joint venture of £1.4m (see
note 14).

St Nicholas Preparatory school is an independent Montessori nursery and preparatory school providing education
of children aged 3 months—11 years with 175 students at the date of acquisition. The acquisition gives the Group
full control of the school.

As the acquisition took place so close to the year end, the amount of revenue and loss included within the
consolidated net loss for the year was not material.

**4 Operating Segments**

The Group’s principal activity during the year was the operation of private schools and related education
activities.

At the year end the Group operated 67 (2016: 67) schools across Europe, Asia and Latin America. The Directors
consider these three segments as the Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8.

This segmental analysis shows the results of these divisions. Revenue is income earned by the Group from third
parties and is stated net of intersegmental revenue, in line with the reports reviewed by the chief decision makers.
Intersegmental revenue mainly includes management charges.

The Group analyses its results at Adjusted EBITDA level on an underlying basis with separate disclosure of
non-underlying costs in arriving at its results before tax. Adjusted EBITDA is the performance measure observed
by the chief decision makers and is defined as underlying operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and
impairment charges. Profit/loss before tax is not reviewed on an operating segment basis by the chief decision
makers, therefore, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Profit/loss before tax is shown below for
completeness. Refer to note 5 for an analysis of non-underlying items.

Non-underlying items are items of income or expenditure which for the Board and financial statement reporting
purposes are disclosed separately because in management’s judgement, due to their nature, size or incidence,
they distort an understanding of the Group’s financial performance and comparability between periods. The
items of expenditure which management designate as being non-underlying include acquisition and business
exploration costs, restructuring costs, impairments of assets, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets and
share based payment schemes.

**Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2017**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**5 Non-underlying items (continued)**

Impairment costs relate to the write down of assets identified as being impaired. Each year all CGU’s and their
associated assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment. If identified as being impaired, an impairment charge
will be made to the income statement. The impairment charge for an individual CGU, which does not result in a
cash cost to the business, is generally one-off in nature and, therefore, is not considered to be a recurring item. In
the event that an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the reversal is treated consistently with the initial
write down and would be recognised within non-underlying items. During the year, the Group impaired two
schools within the Europe operating segment.

Acquisition and business exploration costs are expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or
expansion opportunities including future business development into new countries and regions. These include
any legal and due diligence fees relating to potential or actual acquisitions as well as losses incurred prior to the
opening of new schools. Although costs relating to projects can span multiple financial years, key components of
expenditure for specific projects are non-recurring, for example financial due diligence, legal due diligence, and
market surveys. These costs have no relation to the operational results of existing schools and are split out to
enable the reader of the financial statements to gain greater clarity of the underlying business performance.

Restructuring costs mainly relate to employment cessation and associated legal costs. These costs are incurred
annually but relate to different projects and by their nature will only occur once. During the year ended
31 August 2016, two schools were closed in the UK with costs of £2.2m relating to the closures disclosed within
this category.

Share based payment costs represent the income statement charge relating to the management incentive plan
(MIP). This charge relates to the MIP put in place in June 2013, described in note 9. This charge does not result
in a cash cost to the business and has therefore been shown as non-underlying.

All accounting policies are applied consistently between periods unless disclosures are made in the financial
statements to the effect that there has been an accounting policy change, in which case, the impact of such change
on the comparative numbers will be disclosed.

The tax effect of the non-underlying costs in 2017 was a credit of £449,000 (2016: £262,000).

**8 Directors’ remuneration (continued)**

No Directors have benefits accruing under defined benefit or defined contribution pension schemes. Under
arrangements for selected individuals to subscribe for equity settled shares, a charge has been made to the income
statement of £245,000 (2016: £3,954,000) in respect of Directors and managers within non-underlying operating
costs. Of this charge, £nil (2016: £2,959,000) relates to arrangements which have vested during the periods ended
31 August 2016 and 31 August 2017.

The above emoluments include amounts paid to the highest paid Director as follows:

On 31 March 2016, the Group provided an interest free, unsecured loan of £400,089 to M Uzielli, a Director of
the Company, to enable him to participate in the Cognita Group Management Incentive Plan.

The loan becomes repayable, in cash, at the earlier of the Director leaving the employment of the Group and the
future sale, partial sale, winding up, distribution or listing of the shares in Cognita Topco Limited. In the event of
default, the borrower will be charged and required to pay interest calculated daily at base rate plus 4%.

The borrower may prepay the loan in full or in part, under certain circumstances. No prepayments had been made
against the loan principal at 31 August 2017.

**9 Share based payments**

The Group was acquired by Cognita Topco Limited during the year ended 31 August 2013. As part of the
restructuring, a management incentive plan (MIP) was introduced whereby certain Directors and senior managers
were granted C shares in Cognita Topco Limited. The C shares have limited rights and there is no entitlement to
dividends.

The rewards associated with the MIP are achieved by meeting specific IRR hurdles on the future sale, partial
sale, winding up, distribution or listing of shares in Cognita Topco Limited. These rewards are incremental and
will increase based on the IRR that is achieved by the main shareholders of Cognita Topco Limited. Should the
specific hurdles be achieved, the rewards will be payable to the participants of the MIP.

In 2013, certain senior managers were also granted loans by Cognita Topco Limited in respect of their purchase
of class C1 shares. The settlement or repayment of these loans by the employees is triggered at the same time as
vesting of C shares being by a future sale, partial sale, winding up, distribution or listing of the shares in Cognita
Topco Limited. The loans accrue interest at 4% per annum on a compound basis. The fair value of the loans and
the C shares awarded as a single share-based payment arrangement was calculated, taking account of the
expected settlement event and timing, at £8.7m for the Group and this amount was being charged to the
Consolidated Income Statement of the Group over the expected vesting period of 5 years and 3 months.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**9 Share based payments (continued)**

The Group undertook a full review of the MIP during the year ended 31 August 2016 and identified that a
number of the participants had left employment. As a result, the charge relating to these employees was
accelerated such that the full remaining fair value had been recognised through the Consolidated Income
Statement of the Group and was treated as non-underlying.

In the year, the vesting period remained unchanged with an anticipated vesting date in 2020.

A number of new participants were granted shares in the incentive plan in the year ended 31 August 2016. The
nature and rewards attached to the C shares granted remain consistent with the initial issuance in the year ended
31 August 2013. New participants to the MIP scheme in the year ended 31 August 2016, were also eligible to
acquire B shares in Cognita Topco Limited, these shares rank pari passu with one another and entitle the
B shareholders to participate in the profits of the Company. The terms associated with these shares under the
MIP are consistent with those relating to the C shares.

Valuations were performed by an independent third party at each of the grant dates. Due to the complex features
of the awards, the fair value of these shares at the grant date were derived using an approach called Quadrature.

The following assumptions applied in determining the fair value:

 - An assumed equity value was estimated at grant date

 - A realisation event was assumed to occur at 31 August 2020

 - A risk free rate of return ranging from 0.66% to 1.14%, depending on grant date was used for modelling
purposes

 - A future volatility rate of 43% was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable public
companies adjusted for unique or significant events not expected to affect future volatility

 - An annual employee exit rate of 0% has been factored into the assumptions, as shares are transferred to
other participants

The prior year tax reconciliation has been amended to reallocate an item more appropriately.

In March 2016, the UK Government announced its intention to further reduce the main rate of UK corporation
tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.

Existing temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided may therefore unwind in future periods
at this reduced rate.

This rate change was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been
calculated based on the rate of 17% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

During the year, the Group wrote down £2,516,000 (year ended 31 August 2016: £2,662,000) of property, plant
and equipment following a review for impairment. The impairment calculation was performed in line with the
Group’s impairment accounting policy. Further details of the key assumptions and sensitivities within this
calculation are given in note 13. The impairment loss for the year ended 31 August 2017 is allocated against
Freehold land and buildings, whilst in the year ended 31 August 2016, the impairment loss was allocated between
Freehold and Short leasehold land and buildings and is included in operating loss within the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

Disclosure of capital commitments can be found in note 27 of the financial statements.

During the year, the Group completed a ground rent sale and leaseback of freehold properties at four UK
schools—see note 19. The carrying value of the leased assets as at 31 August 2017 was £12,500,000.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are spread across the Group’s regions. The carrying value of intangible
assets is monitored by reference to Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”). A CGU is typically a school or limited
company for non-school business units. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are discount and
growth rates. The Group considers that all CGU’s operate in a similar sector being education, but acknowledge
that the countries in which the Group operates need to be considered in the calculation of discount rate. Therefore
this year’s impairment reviews adopted discount rates ranging between 9.4% and 14.6%. For all CGU’s a growth
rate of 2.25% is applied with the exclusion of those in Brazil where a rate of 4.95% was used.

**13 Intangible assets—Group (continued)**

The Group monitors its post-tax weighted average cost of capital and those of its competitors using market data.
In considering the discount rates applied to the CGU’s, the Directors have considered the relative sizes and risks
of its CGUs. The impairment reviews use a discount rate adjusted for pre-tax cash flows.

As part of the review for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill in two schools in UK (2016: UK and Brazil)
were identified as being impaired and an adjustment of £107,000 (2016: £6,628,000) was made by the Group to
write down the value of intangible consolidated goodwill.

**_Sensitivity analysis_**

Following the impairment losses recognised in the Group’s UK schools and reported in tangible and intangible
assets respectively, recoverable amounts were equal to carrying amounts.

On the basis of the above, a range of sensitised trading scenarios, carried out on all impairment reviews and for a
reasonably possible range of sensitivities, the discounted future cash flows at 31 August 2017 exceeded the
valuation of tangible and intangible assets.

Impairment calculations are, however, more sensitive to changes in the discount rate. An increase of 1% in the
discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would give rise to an additional impairment charge of
£4.9m (2016: £8.9m) in the Group CGU’s.

The interest in joint venture represented the Group’s contribution to the share capital of St Nicholas Preparatory
School Limited (the “joint venture”), created with a third party to manage the St Nicholas Preparatory School.

The joint venture was structured as a separate vehicle and the Group had a residual interest in the net assets. The
Group owned 50% of the share capital and the articles of association required unanimous consent amongst the
two owners for resolutions to be passed.

On 25 August 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in its joint venture, St Nicholas Preparatory
School in London, UK for a total consideration of £1.3m. The negative goodwill of £1.0m arising on acquisition
was immediately recognised in the income statement (see note 2).

sheet will be released to the income statement in more than one year from the Balance Sheet date.

On 26 January 2017, the Group disposed of Sackville School, UK, leasing the land and buildings to a third party,
thereby creating a finance lease receivable at an initial value of £3,750,000. The terms of the lease provide for a
rent free period until 31 August 2019, during which period finance lease interest will accrue. Interest accruing
from the date of transaction to 31 August 2017 amounted to £12,000.

**Property**

The property provision represents the anticipated costs of returning operating lease premises to their original
state as required by the terms of the related lease. The leases are due to expire within two to three years and,
therefore, the provision is expected to be utilised within this period. The level of provision is based upon an
annual review of the current condition of the building. The review is based upon internal and external
examinations of the property.

**23 Provisions (continued)**

**Severance allowance and non-compulsory insurance**

Severance allowance is paid to certain employees in Vietnam when they terminate their employment contracts
and is estimated based on a consideration of time and services rendered by employees. The provision is
calculated on the basis of a half-month salary for each employee for each year of service with the relevant Group
company and based on basic salary levels at the balance sheet date.

The non-compulsory insurance provision represents income tax and VAT payments for non-compulsory
insurance in the Asia region. The non-compulsory insurance is considered as a taxable income and personal
income tax is estimated based on local tax rate.

**Other**

The other provisions consist of amounts recognised for a loyalty points provision in Super Camps Limited, a
provision for fidelity complement in Spain and a labour litigation provision in Brazil.

The loyalty points provision represents the fair value of loyalty points awarded over the last 24 months and
management anticipate that they will be utilised over the next two years.

The fidelity complement is recognised as stated by the CBA in Spain. The provision covers the extra payments
that may be requested by staff if they comply with certain requirements. The level of provision has been
calculated by an actuary, and the release has been estimated over the next few years.

_Equity reserve_

The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and is recognised in equity. The fair value determined at the
grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period,
based on the Group’s estimate of when the shares will vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based
vesting conditions.

_Translation reserve_

The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising since 1 September 2014, the transition
date to Adopted IFRSs, from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the
translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.

**25 Financial instruments**

The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, equity investments and various items,
such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are
described in more detail below. In order to manage the Group’s exposure to those risks, in particular the Group’s
exposure to interest rate risk, the Group enters into a number of derivative transactions including, but not limited
to, variable to fixed rate interest rate swaps. All transactions in derivatives are undertaken to manage the risks
arising from underlying business activities and no transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange
risk, and interest rate risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are
summarised below.

**_a) Fair values of financial instruments_**

**25 Financial instruments (continued)**

**_a) Fair values of financial instruments (continued)_**

_Effect of change of inputs used in fair value measurement_

The carrying amount of interest bearing trade and other receivables and trade and other payables is deemed to be
a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is determined
by reference to the quoted price for the Senior Secured Loan Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro
MTF Market.

**_b) Credit risk_**

_Financial risk management_

**_Group_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and trade receivables
and the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of these
assets.

The credit risk associated with bank balances is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies.

The principal credit risk in the group therefore arises from trade receivables, which represent outstanding fees
receivable. In order to limit the risk surrounding outstanding fees, student fees are reviewed on a regular basis in
conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.

**_Company_**

The Company had no external receivables at the year end (2016: £nil) and so has no exposure to credit risk.

The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date was:

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**25 Financial instruments (continued)**

**_b) Credit risk (continued)_**

The provision account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that
no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off
against trade receivables directly.

**_c) Liquidity risk_**

_Financial risk management_

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and by investing cash assets safely and profitably. The Group’s policy has been to ensure continuity of funding
and where possible has relocated debt closer to operational activities in appropriate local currencies.

During the year ended 31 August 2015, the Group refinanced all debt other than that held in Brazil and Chile. As
part of this refinancing, on 21 July 2015 Cognita Bondco Parent Limited and Cognita Midco Limited were
inserted between Cognita Topco Limited and Cognita Holdings Limited. Other new companies were also
incorporated including Cognita Financing plc which issued Senior Secured Loan Notes of £280m.

On 4 October 2016, an additional £45m of Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued via a private placement at a
premium of £2.0m to par value.

The Group issued an additional £50m of Senior Secured Loan Notes on 8 May 2017 via a private placement.
These Notes, which carry the same maturity and fixed interest rate of 7.75% were issued under the same
indenture as the initial issuance. A premium of £2.25m to par value was recognised upon the issuance of these
instruments.

The Senior Secured Loan Notes mature on 15 August 2021 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 7.75%. The issue
has been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF (“Multilateral Trading Facility”).

The Group secured a £60m Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility to fund future borrowing requirements which
can be drawn down in a number of different currencies as required. During the year ended 31 August 2016 the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility was increased by £20m to £80m with a further increase of £20m in
September 2016, bringing the total facility to £100m.

The Group has a strong working capital position as student contracts require cash payment in advance of tuition
services, generally on an annual, termly or monthly basis. Trade payables are settled on the basis of credit terms
agreed with the respective suppliers.

**_d) Market risk_**

Market risk as applicable to the Group is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or
interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. These two
elements of Market risk are covered separately below.

_Market risk—Foreign exchange risk_

The Group’s results are reported in pounds sterling. Where possible, the Group seeks to manage the effect of any
exposure that may arise from the translation of the foreign currency assets by borrowing funds denominated in
the local currency of the entity it acquires, or will use hedging instruments to mitigate the exchange risk.

Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign subsidiaries, Group exposure to currency
risk at a transactional level is minimal. The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are usually carried
out in their local currency.

**Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2017**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**25 Financial instruments (continued)**

**_d) Market risk (continued)_**

**_Company_**

The Company had no exposure to foreign currency risk at 31 August 2017 or at 31 August 2016.

_Sensitivity analysis—Group_

If sterling had been 10% stronger / weaker at 31 August 2017, Group equity would have decreased / increased by
£590,000 (2016: £8,735,000). This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and
had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

_Market risk—Interest rate risk_

The Group finances its operations through third party borrowings and in the form of Senior Secured Loan Notes
which carry a fixed rate of interest of 7.75%. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable
interest rate bank borrowings is managed by the use of hedging. It is the Group’s policy to use fixed interest rate
hedging instruments to hedge at least 50% of its bank borrowings.

The interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 August 2017 is shown in the
table below. The table includes trade debtors and creditors which do not attract interest but are subject to fair
value interest rate risk.

All financial assets and liabilities identified as fixed rate instruments in the above table are accruing interest at
rates that are fixed for the life of the instrument. Interest rate swaps are disclosed above at fair value as fixed rate
instruments, whilst the loans that they are hedging are disclosed as variable rate instruments.

_Sensitivity analysis_

At 31 August 2017, the Group had exposure to interest rate sensitivity in respect of variable rate loans held in
Brazil. In respect of these loans, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates over the year would
have increased / decreased the result for the year by £423,000 (2016: £306,000).

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers
the effect of all financial instruments with variable interest rates. The analysis is performed on the same basis for
2016.

**_e) Capital management_**

**_Group and Company_**

The Group manages its capital to safeguard its ability to operate as a going concern and to optimise returns to
shareholders. Overdraft and revolving credit facilities will be used to finance the working capital cycle if
required.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19 after
deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and
retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.

The debt and equity balance in some parts of the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements
such as those imposed by third party loan providers. The local tax treatment is also taken into consideration when
determining the most appropriate capital structure for investments in subsidiaries.

Analysis between Property and Other leases has been restated for year ended 31 August 2016 to correct a
mis-classification between categories.

**Group**

During the year £12,503,000 was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases
(2016: £9,855,000).

**27 Capital Commitments**

**Group**

During the year, the Group entered into contracts to purchase property, plant and equipment for £9,756,000
(2016: £11,671,000). These commitments are expected to be settled within twelve months of the balance sheet
date.

The Group entered into a development contract for the Early Learning Village at Lorong Chuan campus in
Singapore, which opened in July 2017. As at 31 August 2017, a commitment of £11,241,000 (2016:
£58,750,000) remains.

The Group entered into a contract in Hong Kong for a brownfield school development during the prior year. The
development opened in September 2017 with initial refurbishment work due to be completed in January 2018. As
at 31 August 2017 there was a capital commitment of £10,722,000 (2016: £3,699,000).

In December 2014, the Group entered into a promise to purchase agreement with a real estate developer to
construct a school in Chile. The development was completed and opened to students in March 2016. Under the

terms of the agreement, the Group will be required to purchase the school and the freehold property should
certain performance criteria be met, the aggregate contractual commitment at 31 August 2017 is £7,141,000
(2016: £6,431,000).

**28 Contingencies**

**Group Guarantees**

During the period ended 31 August 2015, the Group restructured its debt which involved the formation of new
companies within the Group, including subsidiary undertaking Cognita Financing plc. Cognita Financing plc
issued Senior Secured Loan Notes which are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF Market.
Cognita Bondco Parent Limited and certain subsidiary undertakings are guarantors on a senior basis. Under this
arrangement, the assets of certain Group companies are subject to a fixed and floating charge.

The total gross exposure in relation to the Senior Secured Loan Notes was £379.2m (2016: £280.5m) including
accrued interest, transaction costs and premiums on issue at the end of the year. The Guarantors also grant a
senior guarantee of a Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility agreement concurrently with the Senior Secured
Loan Notes guarantee. The Group also guarantees the loan facilities and deferred consideration in Brazil, Chile
and Hong Kong, with a total exposure of £100.0m (2016: £94.0m).

**Reinstatement of leased land**

The Group is disclosing a contingent liability in relation to reinstatement costs of leasehold land on which it has
constructed school buildings. The terms in the lease contract provide the landlord with an option of reinstating
the leased land to its original preconstruction condition.

It has been estimated that the maximum liability at 31 August 2017 should a reinstatement be required would be
£6,670,000 (2016: £6,544,000 (restated)). This estimated contingent liability represents the cost of demolition of
the entire area of construction including substructure, extraction of piles, back filling to original levels and
re-turfing.

Management have reviewed the contract from a legal perspective and considered other relevant factors in
determining the likely outcome on lease expiry. As a consequence of this review, it has been concluded that
whilst a requirement for reinstatement is possible upon expiry of the lease, it is not probable and therefore no
provision should be recognised in this respect.

**Litigation**

The Group received claims in respect of a potential litigation associated with the criminal conduct of a former
teacher at Southbank International School. The Group maintains insurance cover and has been advised such
cover will be adequate to cover the full amount of any potential claims.

**Tax claims**

The Group has received assessments from HMRC in the aggregate amount of £1,280,000 with respect to PAYE
and NI in connection with the operation of a former management securities plan in the four accounting periods
ended 31 August 2010 to 2013. The net exposure arising from the assessment is deemed to be £500,000. The
Group has appealed these assessments on the basis of guidance from our advisors and no provision has been
made.

**31 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are set out and described in note 1, the Directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.

**Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately
below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

**31 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)**

_Classification of Singapore land lease—decommission liability_

The Group has entered into two land leases in Singapore, upon which school buildings have been constructed.
Note 28 describes the reinstatement clauses included in the lease contracts. Significant judgement is required in
determining the likelihood that reinstatement of the land will be required upon expiry of the lease. In making its
judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingent
liabilities set out in IAS 37. Following this work, management are satisfied that reinstatement costs are not
probable and therefore it is most appropriate to disclose a contingent liability in the financial statements.
Consequently an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the building and restoring the site to its
original state at the end of the lease term has been obtained.

_Revenue recognition—Development/facility fees_

The Group recognises development and facility fees over the tenure or expected tenure of a student within a
school. The Group’s management determines the estimated tenure of a student in order to recognise development
and facility fee revenue over the period of service provision. The estimated tenure is calculated on a school by
school basis using an analytical method based on historical statistics, adjusted for known or anticipated trends.

In making its judgement to apply this recognition basis, management considered the detailed criteria for the
recognition of revenue in the context of linked transactions set out in IAS 18 Revenue, in particular, the
considerations surrounding the length of service provision. Estimates made by management regarding the
calculation of tenure or expected tenure are discussed below.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year, are discussed below.

_Share based payments_

In accordance with IFRS 2, share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The valuation
requires a number of assumptions to be made based on factors outside the Group’s control, such as vesting period
and employee leavers.

_Fair value of assets and liabilities attributable to business combinations_

All business acquisitions made following the transition to IFRS are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3
which requires that all assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of
acquisition. In addition the Group performs a purchase price allocation for each acquisition which identified the
separable intangible assets acquired as part of each business combination. To establish the fair value of these
separable intangible assets, the Group has to make assumptions in relation to the potential future cash flows
relating to these assets which involved assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount
rates and the useful life of such assets.

_Impairment of goodwill_

The Group is required to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually. This requires the Group to
estimate the value in use of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated. The value
in use calculation requires an estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the
CGU and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate.

Management’s estimation of cash flows is based upon the current budgets and forecasts which are established
using management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The estimation of discount rate is considered on a case
by case basis and is achieved using a number of different methodologies which consider current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.

**31 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)**

_Provisions_

The Group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date. The
amount of provision recognised is dependent upon management’s estimation of the likely outcome. At the
balance sheet date, provisions included amounts for lease dilapidations, employee termination and other specific
provisions.

Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis, according to management’s best current estimates and are adjusted
accordingly. Due to the inherent estimates and assumptions required upon the recognition of a provision, the
amount required to settle a provision can be different to the provision recognised at the balance sheet date.

_Recoverability of trade receivables_

An estimation is required to determine the recoverability of fees receivable when collection of the full amount is
not considered virtually certain. At the balance sheet date, all schools assess the recoverability of trade
receivables and record a provision for doubtful debts based on knowledge of individual circumstances as well as
historic empirical evidence of recoverability based on relative ageing of fees receivable.

Where there is evidence that a fee will not be recovered, the fee receivable asset will be derecognised and a bad
debt charge will be recognised in the income statement.

Due to the use of estimates, sometimes there will be a difference between amounts collected in future periods
related to fees receivable recognised at the balance sheet date. The difference between the carrying amount of the
fee receivable on the balance sheet and the amount actually collected in a future period is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_Deferred tax assets_

In order to determine the recoverability and therefore recognition of deferred tax assets, the Group must estimate
the probable future taxable profits, against which the temporary timing differences can be utilised. This estimate
requires the use of current budgets and forecasts to determine future taxable profits and the timing of when these
will be realised.

Management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date and if it is considered
probable that all, or a part of the deferred tax asset will not be utilised within 5 years, the asset is derecognised.

**Strategic report**

The Directors submit the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group (the “Group”) for the year ended 31 August 2016.

The Group is a leading global operator of private-pay K-12 schools. The Directors are pleased with the
performance during the year to 31 August 2016 which was in line with expectations. At the year end, the Group
operated 67 (2015: 66) schools across Europe, Asia and Latin America with an average total capacity of 43,544
(2015: 42,063) places and a total average enrolment of 33,595 (2015: 31,764) FTE students.

Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (the “Company”) was formed on 3 July 2015 as part of a loan refinancing
arrangement and became the immediate parent company of Cognita Holdings Limited on 21 July 2015.

The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cognita Midco Limited, a company registered in England and
Wales. Cognita Topco Limited, a company registered in Jersey and incorporated under Companies (Jersey) Law
1999, is the immediate parent company of Cognita Midco Limited.

Cognita Topco Limited is jointly controlled by The Bregal Fund III LP and KKR European Fund III LP. The
audited, consolidated financial statements of Cognita Topco Limited are available to the public by application to
the registered office of that company, or from Companies House with the financial statements of the parent
company.

As part of the refinancing, Cognita Financing plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company which was
incorporated on 3 July 2015, issued debt in the form of Senior Secured Loan Notes of £280m on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange—Euro MTF (“Multilateral Trading Facility”). In accordance with the terms of the Senior
Secured Loan Notes indenture, the Company is required to prepare consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, the results presented to August 2015 represent the 42 day period from the date of acquisition of
Cognita Holdings Limited on 22 July 2015 to 31 August 2015. The results presented to 31 August 2016 represent
a full year of activity.

**Loss for the year before taxation**

The Group’s loss before tax was £32.9m for the year ended 31 August 2016, which was in line with
managements expectations and reflective of the ongoing investment in growing the business.

**Capital expenditure**

During the year, the Group invested £124.3m in capital expenditure. The capital expenditure reported in the year
represents amounts spent on the regular renewal of estate, along with amounts invested in the expansion plans of
the Group’s existing portfolio of schools, additional investment in the new early childhood facility being built in
Singapore and the £65.1m acquisition of the school property including fees in Hong Kong.

Amounts spent on development capital represented £108.0m compared to operating capital expenditure of
£16.3m. Operating capital expenditure includes investment in ensuring schools maintain their standards and
compliance with all regulations, whilst development capital expenditure represents investment made to expand
capacity at the Group’s schools and for construction and development of other facilities which do not directly
result in capacity expansion.

**Developments during the year**

**_Acquisition of brownfield school property in Hong Kong_**

The Group completed the purchase of a school property in Kowloon, Hong Kong on 15 April 2016. The building
acquired has capacity for c. 800 students, with expansion work planned to increase this to over 1,100. The
purchase price paid, excluding fees and expenses, was HKD 673m (c. £61.2m). The acquisition was funded using
a combination of existing cash resources, drawdown on the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility and local
financing. A complete refurbishment of the existing school building, which is expected to cost approximately
HKD 400m, (c. £37m), commenced during the final quarter of the year.

The school is anticipated to open in August 2017, subject to standard regulatory approvals. Refurbishment work
is being fully funded via locally raised non-recourse debt financing.

**_Construction of Early Childhood Facility in Singapore_**

The Group is investing £102.0m in land and buildings to develop a new facility dedicated to early childhood
learning in Singapore. The new facility is scheduled to open in August 2017 and will provide over 2,100
additional seats. As at 31 August 2016, c. £38.4m, in total, had been invested in this project, with c. £26.7m
incurred in the year ended 31 August 2016.

**_Acquisitions in Spain and Thailand_**

The Group acquired two schools during the year, International School of Barcelona in Sitges, Spain and
St. Andrews Dusit Campus Co Limited in Thailand.

On 1st January 2016, the Group acquired the trade and assets of International School of Barcelona, Sitges for
total consideration of approximately £2.2m. The acquisition was funded from existing cash resources. The school
had c. 300 students at the date of acquisition and has a capacity for 450 students.

St. Andrews Dusit Campus Co Limited, which operates St. Andrews International School Bangkok, Dusit was
acquired on 26 February 2016. The consideration, which was funded using existing cash resources, was £2.0m
for a 70% shareholding with a put/call option to purchase an additional 20% of the minority interest. The call
option can be exercised by either party between the acquisition date and 31 July 2020.

The school had c.160 students at the date of acquisition, with a current capacity of 420. The new acquisition
complements the existing Thailand portfolio and will act as an additional feeder school into our Bangkok
Sukhumvit 107 campus.

**_Construction of new campus in Vietnam_**

Construction has commenced on a new 900 seat campus which will house the secondary school of the
International School of Ho Chi Minh City (ISHCMC). This is a USD 16.2m (c. £12m) project, jointly funded
with a local developer, and is expected to open in August 2017. It will allow ISHCMC to continue to grow
enrolments which currently stand at c. 1,000.

**_New school and bilingual education offering in Chile_**

The group opened a new school in Santiago, Chile in March 2016. Colegio Pumahue Chicauma which teaches a
Chilean national curriculum has become the tenth school in the Cognita school network in Chile. The school has
a capacity of c.230 and opened with 112 students.

The building from which the school operates was built by a real estate developer, with whom Cognita entered
into a promise to purchase agreement in December 2014. The terms of the agreement remain unchanged, with the
Group being required to purchase the school and freehold property should certain performance criteria be met.

The Group’s current assessment of the agreement is that uncertainty remains around the timing of the
crystallisation of the obligation and therefore the contractual commitment, currently estimated at £6.4m, and
remains a contingent liability for accounting purposes.

Also in March 2016, three of the Group’s schools in Chile introduced English World, a bilingual stream, to their
Early Years programmes. Initial uptake of the new offering, which attracts higher fees, has exceeded
expectations.

**_School Closures_**

Chilton Cantelo and Cranbrook schools in the United Kingdom were closed at the end of the 2016 summer term.
An assessment was undertaken prior to the decision to begin a consultation process, which identified that the
student numbers at each of the schools had reduced to a level whereby the breadth of education would be
compromised from the next academic year. Student numbers at both schools have significantly reduced in recent
years, due to changes in the market dynamics in each of the school catchments, despite the Group’s continued
investment in improving facilities and expanding educational provision.

After exploring all the available options, the consultation process concluded and the closure announcement was
made in March 2016.

At the beginning of the consultation process, the school had a combined total of c.390 students. The losses
incurred by both schools in aggregate in the year to 31 August 2016 were £4.5m. The schools were not actively
marketed for sale at the year end date and therefore have not been treated as assets held for disposal.

**_Creation of distributable reserves_**

A share capital reduction exercise was undertaken during the year. The exercise, which has increased
distributable reserves across seven UK Group entities, facilitates the movement of cash within the group by way
of intra-group dividends.

**_British referendum on Europe_**

As a UK based organisation with global operations, management recognise that the Brexit vote will have
implications for the Group in financial, operational and regulatory areas. Whilst the timing and nature of the
UK’s separation from the EU remain unclear, management have identified some areas of potential business risk
which they will keep under review as events unfold.

**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Strategic report (continued)**

_Currency exposure: Fluctuations in exchange rates will impact Group results which are reported in GBP._
Approximately 58% of Group revenue, 82% of Group EBITDA and 90% of Group capex are denominated in
foreign currency. The Group has entered into forward exchange contracts in respect of the Senior Secured Loan
Notes as disclosed in the final section of this report.

_Student and staffing recruitment and retention: The potential impact on London’s status as a financial centre may_
affect demand for international schools. However, the weakening of the Great British Pound against other major
currencies may make Cognita’s UK independent schools more competitive internationally as tuition fees become
more affordable for foreign families looking to educate their children in the UK. A further consideration is that
attracting and retaining students and teachers from the EU may become more difficult if visa entry requirements
become more stringent.

_Regulatory changes: Cognita will be working closely with the National Association of British Schools in Spain,_
the Council of British International School and the British Council to review the impact of Brexit, if any, on the
use of British qualifications for Spanish university entry and on Spanish students applying to British universities.

Management’s view is that the Group’s diverse global portfolio and the robust nature of the education sector will
provide resilience against the uncertainties faced during the Brexit transition period.

**_Serious Case Review_**

The Serious Case Review related to the criminal activity of a former teacher at Southbank International School
was published on 20 January 2016. The publication of the Serious Case Review has not had a material adverse
effect on our enrolments or retention of students at the three Southbank schools.

**_Funding Secured to support Group growth_**

During the year ended 31 August 2016, the Super Senior Revolving Credit facility was increased by £20m to
£80m.

**Post balance sheet events**

**_Acquisition of The English Montessori School, Madrid_**

On 6 September 2016, the Group acquired 100% shareholding in The English Montessori School, a school based
in Madrid, Spain. The consideration, which was funded following a drawdown on the Revolving Credit Facility,
was approximately €10.1m (c. £8.6m).

The school is an independent British school offering education to students aged 3-18 years. The schools had
c.790 students at the date of acquisition, with a current capacity of c.1,000.

**_Acquisition of 49% minority interest in Chile_**

The Group formally notified the exercise of a call option to purchase the remaining 49% interest in the Chile
schools business via its shareholding in Desarrollos Educacionales, SA on 29 July 2016. Completion took place
on 26 September 2016 at an agreed price of CLP 6.6bn (c. £7.7m).

**_Funding Secured to support Group growth_**

On 4 October 2016, an additional £45m of Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued at a premium of £2.0m to par
value. This additional funding followed a £20m increase to the Super Senior Revolving Credit facility on
19 September 2016, taking the total facility to £100m.

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Future developments**

The Group will continue to invest in its existing schools, with some strategic development projects planned for
the year ended 31 August 2017 and beyond. The Group will continue to develop opportunities in all regions.

**Statement of Going Concern**

The Group and Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect their future development,
performance and position are set out in this report. The financial position of the Group and Company, its cash
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out in the financial statements. The Group and
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital are described in note 1 to the financial
statements. Further information on the Group’s capital management can be found in note 25 to the financial
statements.

Details of the Group and Company’s financial risk management objectives, its financial instruments and hedging
activities; and exposures to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are set out below and in further detail in note
25 to the financial statements.

During the year ended 31 August 2015, the Group refinanced substantially all of its debt, with the exception of
debt held by Group companies in Brazil and Chile. Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued and the proceeds
were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness and related costs. The Senior Secured Loan Notes mature on
15 August 2021. As part of this refinancing arrangement, deep discounted bonds previously issued by Cognita
Topco Limited were collapsed via a capitalisation.

On 4 October 2016, an additional £45m of Senior Secured Loan Notes were issued at a premium of £2.0m to par
value. This additional funding followed a £20m increase to the Super Senior Revolving Credit facility during the
year ended 31 August 2016 and a further increase of £20m post year end, which in aggregate extended the
facility to £100m.

The Directors have performed a review of the Group’s finances and have a reasonable expectation that the
business has adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future and will be able to support the repayment
of its debt facilities and related interest payments. The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

**Controlling parties and ultimate parent undertaking**

The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is Cognita Midco Limited, a company incorporated in England
and Wales. The ultimate parent undertaking is Cognita Topco Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey which
is jointly controlled by The Bregal Fund III LP and Crimson Cayman Holding Limited, which itself is controlled
by KKR European Fund III LP see note 30.

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties**

The management of the business and the execution of the Group’s strategy are subject to a number of risks. Risks
are reviewed by the Board of Directors and appropriate processes put in place to monitor and mitigate them. The
key business risks for the Group are described in more detail below:

**Child protection and safeguarding**

The Group may be liable for certain acts that affect the health and safety of students and staff at schools, or
which breach the duty of care towards students, which may harm the Group’s reputation and adversely affect the
business and financial results. The Group has policies and procedures in place which are aligned to regulatory
standards and are globally consistent.

**Cognita Bondco Parent Limited**

**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

**Health and safety**

The prevention of injury to employees, students, parents and other customers in the Group is of utmost
importance. The Group has clear policies and procedures which are in place and aligned to regulatory standards.

**Market forces**

Market forces have implications on pricing, demand for the Group’s services and ultimately the Group’s return
on investment. The Group invests in market research across all regions to ensure that it has a detailed and current
knowledge and understanding of the sector in which it operates and the related risks arising from market forces.

To minimise the possible impact of market forces, the Group focuses on delivering educational excellence, to
ensure that Cognita schools are competitive in the private schools market even when market forces cause
unfavourable economic conditions.

**Political environment**

The Group is subject to the political conditions of each country in which it operates. Political events can lead to
issues such as sudden changes in laws, regulations, taxes and price volatility. The Group monitors political risk to
ensure compliance with local requirements and minimises exposure to changes through maintaining and
modifying appropriate business procedures as necessary.

During the year the Group has maintained and reviewed its anti-bribery and corruption policy which
encompasses existing controls as well as additional procedures. Anti-bribery and corruption procedures are
reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure continued compliance.

**ICT systems and infrastructure**

The Directors understand the importance of ICT within the business. The Group has controls and disaster
recovery plans in place in case of a significant system failure. The Group is also committed to enhancing the
current provision of ICT systems through ongoing investment into the business.

**Cyber risk and data protection**

The Group collect and retain personal data and unauthorised disclosure of this data due to a systems failure or
otherwise could have a damaging effect on the business. The Group has policies and procedures in place which
are aligned to regulatory standards.

**Human resources**

Retention of high quality staff both educational and non-educational is critical to the success of the business. The
Group’s employment policies, remuneration and benefits packages are regularly reviewed to ensure we can
attract and retain the best staff.

**Supporting growth**

The continued growth and financial performance of the Group depends on having the right resources in place.
Consequently, the Group continually assesses the needs of each region to ensure that the Group infrastructure
continues to expand in line with growth to ensure the necessary resources for current and future development.

A key focus of the Group is to ensure that newly acquired schools are integrated efficiently and effectively. This
enables minimal disruption, continuity in educational provision and access to key improvements and benefits
which membership of the Group can offer.

**Cognita Bondco Parent Limited**

**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

**Financial capital risk**

The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, equity investments and various items,
such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to facilitate the Group’s operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are
described in more detail below.

In order to manage the Group’s exposure to those risks, in particular the Group’s exposure to exchange rate risk,
the Group enters into a number of derivative transactions including, foreign currency forward contracts.

All transactions in derivatives are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities and
no transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and credit
risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

**Macroeconomic environment**

Our operations are affected by the general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we operate.
These macroeconomic conditions are monitored on an ongoing basis along with the impact on our current and
future financial performance. Risks identified during the year included potential implications arising from the
British referendum on the EU, softening in the growth outlook for the Asia region driven by global
macroeconomic environment changes and general economic pressure and political changes in the Latin America
region.

To date we have seen limited impact of these factors on our financial performance due to the importance of
education spend for parents and the general stability of the markets in which we operate, as well as our focus on
controlling our costs. Whilst for these reasons management believe our revenue and profitability are relatively
resilient to fluctuations as a result of macroeconomic conditions, we will continue to monitor developments and
the potential risks relating to these.

**Liquidity risk**

The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and by investing cash assets safely and profitably.

The Group is supported by its ultimate parent, whose policy has been to ensure continuity of funding. In 2015,
the Group secured funding by issuing £280m of Senior Secured Loan Notes. In October 2016, the Group issued
an additional £45m of Loan notes through a private placement. Additionally, the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility was increased by £20m to £80m during the year ended 31 August 2016 and subsequently increased by a
further £20m on 19 September 2016.

This funding will provide sufficient liquidity to the Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group through to the
maturity of the Senior Secured Loan Notes on 15 August 2021.

The maturity of borrowings at the balance sheet date is set out in note 19 to the financial statements. In total, the
Cognita Bondco Parent Limited Group has access to committed borrowing facilities of £402.7m (2015:
£311.2m), of which £296.3m mature beyond 2020.

The Group is also able to mitigate liquidity risk through short-term and flexible overdraft facilities.

**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Strategic report (continued)**

**Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)**

**Foreign exchange risk**

The Group’s results are reported in pounds Sterling. Where possible, the Group seeks to manage the effect of any
exposure that may arise from the translation of the foreign currency assets by borrowing funds denominated in
the local currency of the entity it acquires, or will use hedging instruments to mitigate the exchange risk.

Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign subsidiaries, Group exposure to currency
risk at a transactional level is minimal. The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are usually carried
out in local currency.

The Group reassessed its hedging arrangements following the Group refinancing to cover its sterling exposure on
the Senior Secured Loan Notes by entering into forward currency contracts. Further details are disclosed in
note 21 of the financial statements.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through fixed rate Senior Secured Loan Notes, bank borrowings and
Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its bank borrowings is managed
by the use of hedging or fixed interest rate instruments. It is the Group’s policy to use fixed interest rate
instruments or to use fixed rate hedging instruments to ix interest rates on at least 50% of its bank borrowings.

**Credit risk**

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The credit risk associated with cash is
limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The
principal credit risk therefore arises from its trade receivables.

In order to manage credit risk, management sets limits for customers in accordance with prudent general practice
in the independent education sector. Credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in
conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.

**Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law they have elected to prepare both the group and the parent company financial statements in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that
period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:

 - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

 - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

 - state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and

 - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
group and the parent company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group and Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the
assets of the Group and Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**1 Accounting policies**

**_General information_**

Cognita Bondco Parent Limited (the “Company”) is a Company incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cognita Midco Limited. The ultimate controlling party
is Cognita Topco Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey which is jointly controlled by The Bregal Fund III
LP and Crimson Cayman Holding Limited which is controlled by KKR European Fund III LP.

The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) during the period
was the operation of private-pay K-12 schools and related education activities. These financial statements are for
this Company and the Group.

**_Basis of preparation_**

Both the Company and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). On
publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is
taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income
statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of the following assets and
liabilities which are stated at their fair value in accordance with the relevant Adopted IFRSs:

 - Derivative financial instruments

 - Liabilities for equity-settled share based payments.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods
presented in these consolidated financial statements.

Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on
the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed
in note 31.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s interest in its jointly controlled entity. Control exists when the
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Total comprehensive
income is attributed to non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit
balance.

The governance of a jointly controlled entity is established by contractual agreement which requires the
venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. Therefore the Group has joint
control of the entities activities. The equity method is used to account for the jointly controlled entity. The
Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity
movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint
control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.

**Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Basis of consolidation (continued)_**

Common control accounting has been applied in respect of the acquisition of the Cognita Holdings Limited
Group in the period ended 31 August 2015, on the basis that both entities were under the common ownership of
the ultimate parent company, Cognita Topco Limited.

The income statement effect of common control accounting is to combine the post-acquisition results of the
acquired company with the results of the Company. Goodwill is not calculated under this method of accounting.
The balance sheet is brought into the consolidation at book values with any pre-acquisition reserves of the
acquired company being held in a merger reserve.

**_Going concern_**

The Group has continued to expand both organically and via acquisitions during the year. The growth has been
funded from operating cash flow and short and long term borrowings (see note 19). Future growth will be funded
from suitable financing arrangements as well as cash flows generated from operations.

The information disclosed in the Strategic Report explains the Directors’ assessment of risk within the Group.
The Group is structured to enable sharing of resources where possible, including banking arrangements and
liquid assets between Group companies. The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage these business
risks in the current economic climate.

The Directors have performed a review of the Group and have a reasonable expectation that the business has
adequate resources to continue into the foreseeable future. The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

The principal accounting policies are set out below. They have remained unchanged from the previous period.

**_Foreign currency_**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated
financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling,
which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Group.

i) Foreign currency transactions

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.

At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the income statement, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.

ii) Foreign operations

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign
operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to the Group’s

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Foreign currency (continued)_**

presentational currency at foreign exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. The revenues and
expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising are reported as an item
of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve, attributed to non-controlling interests
as appropriate.

Exchange differences arising from monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the
settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net
investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.

**_Classification of financial instruments_**

The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories:

 - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

 - Held to maturity financial assets

 - Loans and receivables

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
substance of the contractual arrangement.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised as proceeds received, net of direct issue
costs.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.

**_Non-derivative financial instruments_**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, cash and cash
equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other interest bearing loans and
borrowings.

**_Investments in equity securities_**

Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the parent company accounts.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. In the cash flow statement, cash and cash
equivalents includes bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any impairment losses. Due to their shortterm nature, the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. A provision for
impairment of receivables is applied where there is empirical evidence that the Group will not be able to recover

**_Trade and other receivables (continued)_**

the contracted cash inflows. When certainty is obtained that a receivable is not recoverable, the specific
receivable is written off.

**_Trade and other payables_**

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value
of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

**_Interest-bearing borrowings_**

Senior Secured Loan Notes and bank borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Where amortised cost using straight line amortisation
approximates the outcome under the effective interest method, the straight line method is adopted.

**_Derivative financial instruments and hedging_**

The Group uses forward contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange and
interest rates of bank borrowings. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The fair value of
interest rate swaps are based on Mark to Market values provided by the issuing financial institutions. These
values are mid-market levels as at close of business on the balance sheet date. The gain or loss on
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group has not adopted hedge
accounting in relation to these instruments.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are
classified as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land
is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at
an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at
inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, using the
straight-line method over the useful economic life of that asset. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful
lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Freehold buildings – 20 to 60 years
Short leasehold land buildings – the remaining life of the lease
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 1 to 10 years
Computer equipment – 2 to 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted if
appropriate.

Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. Upon completion the asset will be transferred into the
relevant category of property, plant and equipment and will be depreciated over its estimated useful life.

**Financial Statements**
**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Business combinations_**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.

The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

 - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

 - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus

 - the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

 - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are
expensed as incurred.

On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both
present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of
liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net
assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value at
the acquisition date.

**_Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests_**

Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for
as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such
transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of
the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling
interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.

**_Goodwill and Intangible assets_**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill at fair value
if those assets are separately identifiable and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of
intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and intangibles with an indefinite useful life are not
amortised but are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Capitalised software and other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives of other intangibles are as follows:

Computer software – 3 years
Customer contracts – average tenure of a student at relevant school
School licences – over the length of the licence
Brands – 20 years
Favourable leases – over the remaining length of the lease

**Year ended 31 August 2016**

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**1 Accounting policies (continued)**

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle
and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs in bringing them to their existing
location and condition.

**_Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets_**

_Financial assets (including receivables)_

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence
indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a
negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

_Non-financial assets_

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill is assessed
for impairment at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition and subsequently at each reporting date.

Indications of impairment are identified by reviewing events or changes in circumstance which suggest that the
carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount
is estimated. The recoverable amount is deemed to be the higher of net realisable value (fair value less costs to
sell) and value in use.

Value in use is calculated by discounting estimated future post-tax cash flows to their present value using a
post-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset.

The discount rate applied is based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group’s operations in
the country the asset sits. Estimated future cash flows are based on Board approved budgets which represent our
best estimate of future performance, supported by historical trends, known operating margins and achievable
growth or cost saving targets. An inflationary growth rate of 2.25% was used to extrapolate beyond the most
recent forecasts, representing the inflation rate for the business based on latest economic information.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash
inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).

The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cashgenerating units (“CGU”). Impairment testing is performed at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for
internal reporting purposes. Therefore a CGU represents an individual school or group of schools purchased as
one business acquisition transaction. No individual CGU’s are considered significant in comparison to the total
carrying value of goodwill.

Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss in recognised
in the income statement. Impairment losses in respect of a CGU are initially allocated against the carrying
amount of goodwill allocated to the units and then subsequently against the carrying amounts of other assets
within the CGU.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are irreversible. Impairment losses recognised against other
assets can be subsequently reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are therefore assessed at each reporting date for
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that
the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable for services or goods provided in the
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is recognised based on
the following criteria:

 - it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the Group

 - the revenue can be measured reliably

 - the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measure reliably

Revenue is generated from the provision of educational services and the sale of related services and goods. The
recognition of material revenue streams is detailed below:

 - **Tuition fees**

These are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the service provision. The fee will be recognised
over the full 12 months of that academic year. Annual fee rates are used as the basis for calculating the monthly
fee recognised.

 - **Application/enrolment fees**

These fees relate to the processing of new applications and where successful, a formal offer of a place within one
of the Group’s schools is made. These fees are recognised at the point at which an application is processed.

 - **Development/facility fees**

This is a fee for the provision of the facilities made available to a student during their tenure at a Group school.
These fees are dependent upon the provision of tuition services and are therefore directly linked. The revenue is
recognised over the expected tenure of a student within the school. The expected tenure is considered on a school
by school basis and this estimate is reconsidered on an annual basis.

 - **Holiday camp revenue**

Fees payable for holiday camp services are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the service
provision.

 - **Other revenue**

This represents a number of income streams including fees for information technology, transportation, clubs,
trips and income from the sale of books, uniforms and canteen sales. Revenue is recognised upon the provision of
services or upon sale of goods.

All revenue is presented net of discounts, the recognition of which is consistent with the related revenue stream.

**_Employee benefits_**

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.

**_Employee bene its (continued)_**

_Multi-employer plans_

The Group participates in the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (England and Wales) (“the TPS”), in respect of certain
teaching staff. This is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan and it is not possible for the Group to use
defined benefit accounting as sufficient information is not available. Accordingly no provision can be made for
any under or over provision of funding within the plan as required under IAS 19. For further detail on the TPS
see note 22.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of
past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

_Share based payment transactions_

Share based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own
equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment transactions, regardless of how the
equity instruments are obtained by the Group.

Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the
grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the
determination of the fair value of equity-settled share based transactions are set out in note 9.

The fair-value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as
a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates,
if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with
the corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.

**_Provisions_**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as
a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount
is the present value of those cash flows.

**_Expenses_**

_Operating lease payments_

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total
lease expense.

**_Expenses (continued)_**

_Finance lease payments_

Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding
liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

_Financing income and expenses_

Financing expenses comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance
leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions,
and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see foreign currency accounting
policy). Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset
that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Financing
income comprise interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.

Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest
method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments
is established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

**_Taxation_**

Tax on the loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous periods.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences
are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised.

**Standards issued but not yet effective**

The Group has considered all new standards and interpretations that are endorsed but not yet effective at the year
end and views that there will be no significant impact on the financial statements next year.

**2 Acquisitions of subsidiaries**

**_Acquisitions in the current period_**

During the year the Group acquired two schools, one in Spain and one in Thailand. The Group incurred costs
related to these acquisitions of £932,000 relating to legal and financial due diligence and transaction costs during
the year ended 31 August 2016. These costs have been included in non-underlying costs in the Group’s
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**2 Acquisitions of subsidiaries (continued)**

**_Acquisitions in the current period (continued)_**

In the period from acquisition to 31 August 2016, the schools contributed £275,000 net loss to the consolidated
net loss for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 September 2015, the impact on Group revenue would
have been an increase of £3,908,000 and the impact on the Group net loss would been an estimated £553,600. In
determining these amounts, management have assumed that the fair value adjustment that arose on the date of
acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 September 2015.

More detail is provided on each acquisition below:

**Spain**

On 1 January 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the trade and assets of the International School of Barcelona,
Sitges.

The primary reason for the business combination is to facilitate further expansion of the British School of
Barcelona (BSB), by integrating the acquired site and providing service provision across both campuses. The
acquired school already has an established reputation and academic track record and historically has been one of
BSB’s main competitors.

**2 Acquisitions of subsidiaries (continued)**

**_Acquisitions in the current period (continued)_**

The entity acquired holds the trade and assets of a school based in Bangkok, Thailand, branded as St Andrews
International School Bangkok Dusit Campus. The primary reason for the business combination is that it
complements the Group’s existing portfolio. The acquired school already has an established reputation and is
located in central Bangkok in a high growing catchment area. There is high demand for places at the school and
Cognita will enable capacity expansion whilst further building the reputation and academic record of the school.

**4 Operating Segments**

The Group’s principal activity during the year was the operation of private schools and related education
activities.

At the year end the Group operated 67 (2015: 66) schools across Europe, Asia and Latin America. The Directors
consider these three segments as the Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8.

This segmental analysis shows the results of these divisions. Revenue is income earned by the Group from third
parties and is stated net of intersegmental revenue, in line with the reports reviewed by the chief decision makers.
Intersegmental revenue mainly includes management charges.

The Group analyses its results at Adjusted EBITDA level on an underlying basis with separate disclosure of
non-underlying costs in arriving at its results before tax. Adjusted EBITDA is the performance measure observed
by the chief decision makers and is defined as underlying operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and
impairment charges. Profit/loss before tax is not reviewed on an operating segment basis by the chief decision
makers, therefore a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Profit/loss before tax is shown below for
completeness. Refer to note 5 for an analysis of non-underlying items.

Non-underlying items are items of income or expenditure which for the Board and financial statement reporting
purposes are disclosed separately because in management’s judgement, due to their nature, size or incidence,
they distort an understanding of the Group’s financial performance and comparability between periods. The
items of expenditure which management designate as being non-underlying include acquisition and business
exploration costs, restructuring and exceptional advisory costs, impairments of assets, profit and losses on
disposal of fixed assets and share based payment schemes.

Impairment costs relate to the write down of assets identified as being impaired. Each year all CGU’s and their
associated assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment, if identified as being impaired, an impairment charge
will be made to the income statement. The impairment charge for an individual CGU, which does not result in a
cash cost to the business, is generally one-off in nature and therefore is not considered to be a recurring item. In
the event that an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the reversal is treated consistently with the initial
write down and would be recognised within non-underlying items.

Acquisition and business exploration costs are expenses incurred to seek out and acquire new schools or
expansion opportunities including future business development into new countries and regions. These include
any legal and due diligence fees relating to potential or actual acquisitions. Although costs relating to projects
can span multiple financial years, key components of expenditure for specific projects are non-recurring, for
example financial due diligence, legal due diligence, market surveys. These costs have no relation to the
operational results of existing schools and are split out to enable the reader of the financial statements to gain
greater clarity of the underlying business performance.

Restructuring costs mainly relate to employment cessation and associated legal costs. These costs are incurred
annually but relate to different projects and by nature will only occur once. Exceptional advisory costs relate to
advisory fees with respect to the review and assessment of the Group’s child safeguarding policies and
procedures. During the year ended 31 August 2016, two schools were closed in the UK. Costs of £2.2m relating
to the closures are disclosed within this category.

Share based payment costs represent the income statement charge relating to the management incentive plan
(MIP). This charge relates to the MIP put in place in June 2013, described in note 9. This charge does not result
in a cash cost to the business and has therefore been shown as non-underlying.

All accounting policies are applied consistently between periods unless disclosures are made in the financial
statements to the effect that there has been an accounting policy change, in which case, the impact of such change
on the comparative numbers will be disclosed.

The tax effect of the non-underlying costs in 2016 was a credit of £262,400 (2015: £334,200).

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**8 Directors’ remuneration (continued)**

The loan becomes repayable, in cash, at the earlier of the Director leaving the employment of the Group and the
future sale, partial sale, winding up, distribution or listing of the shares in Cognita Topco Limited. In the event of
default, the borrower will be charged and required to pay interest calculated daily at base rate plus 4% The
borrower may prepay the loan in full or in part, under certain circumstances. No prepayments had been made
against the loan principal at 31 August 2016.

**9 Share based payments**

The Group was acquired by Cognita Topco Limited during the year ended 31 August 2013. As part of the
restructuring, a management incentive plan (MIP) was introduced whereby certain Directors and senior managers
were granted C shares in Cognita Topco Limited. The C shares have limited rights and there is no entitlement to
dividends.

The rewards associated with the MIP are achieved by meeting specific IRR hurdles on the future sale, partial
sale, winding up, distribution or listing of shares in Cognita Topco Limited. These rewards are incremental and
will increase based on the IRR that is achieved by the main shareholders of Cognita Topco Limited. Should the
specific hurdles be achieved, the rewards will be payable to the participants of the MIP.

Certain senior managers were also granted loans by Cognita Topco Limited in respect of their purchase of these
C shares. The settlement or repayment of these loans by the employees is triggered at the same time as vesting of
C shares being by a future sale, partial sale, winding up, distribution or listing of the shares in Cognita Topco
Limited. The loans accrue interest at 4% per annum on a compound basis. The fair value of the loans and the C
shares awarded as a single share-based payment arrangement was calculated, taking account of the expected
settlement event and timing, at £8.7m for the Group and this amount was being charged to the Consolidated
Income Statement of the Group over the expected vesting period of 5 years and 3 months.

The Group undertook a full review of the MIP during the year ended 31 August 2016 and identified that a
number of the participants had left employment. As a result, the charge relating to these employees was
accelerated such that the full remaining fair value had been recognised through the Consolidated Income
Statement of the Group and has been treated as non-underlying. The vesting period was also reviewed and
updated leading to an expected vesting period of 7 years and 3 months from the date of the initial issuance in
June 2013.

A number of new participants were granted shares in the incentive plan in the year ended 31 August 2016. The
nature and rewards attached to the C shares granted remain consistent with the initial issuance in the year ended
31 August 2013. New participants to the MIP scheme in the year ended 31 August 2016, were also eligible to
acquire B shares in Cognita Topco Limited, these shares rank pari passu with one another and entitle the B
shareholders to participate in the profits of the Company. The terms associated with these shares under the MIP
are consistent with those relating to the C shares.

Valuations were performed by an independent third party at each of the grant dates during the year. Due to the
complex features of the awards, the fair value of these shares at the grant date were derived using an approach
called Quadrature.

The following assumptions applied in determining the fair value:

 - An assumed equity value was estimated at grant date

 - A realisation event was assumed to occur at 31 August 2020

 - A risk free rate of return ranging from 0.66% to 1.14%, depending on grant date was used for modelling
purposes

 - A future volatility rate of 43% was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable public
companies adjusted for unique or significant events not expected to affect future volatility

 - An annual employee exit rate of 0% has been factored into the assumptions, as shares are transferred to
other participants

The restatement represents a correction to the prior year classification of Goodwill and Other intangibles. The
adjustment has no impact on the net book value and no impact in the consolidated income and other
comprehensive statement of comprehensive income statement.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are spread across the Group’s regions. The carrying value of intangible
assets is monitored by reference to Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”). A CGU is typically a school or limited
company for non-school business units. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are discount and
growth rates. The Group considers that all CGU’s operate in a similar sector being education, but acknowledge
that the countries in which the Group operates need to be considered in the calculation of discount rate. Therefore
this year’s impairment reviews adopted discount rates ranging between 8.7% and 18.0%. For all CGU’s a growth
rate of 2.25% is applied.

The Group monitors its post-tax weighted average Cost of Capital and those of its competitors using market data.
In considering the discount rates applied to the CGU’s, the Directors have considered the relative sizes and risks
of its CGUs. The impairment reviews use a discount rate adjusted for pre-tax cash flows.

As part of the review for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill in two schools in Brazil were identified as
being impaired and an adjustment of £6,628,000 (period ended 31 August 2015: £nil) was made by the Group to
write down the value of intangible consolidated goodwill.

**13 Intangible assets—Group (continued)**

_Sensitivity analysis_

Following the impairment losses recognised in the Group’s UK and Brazil schools and reported in tangible and
intangible assets respectively, recoverable amounts were equal to carrying amounts. Therefore, any adverse
movement in a key assumption would lead to further impairment in the UK and Brazil CGU’s.

The sensitivity of goodwill carrying values to possible changes in key assumptions has been performed on the
remaining CGU’s in the UK and Brazil. In the UK, an increase in discount rate of 0.4% (2015: 1.5%) and a
decrease in growth rate of 0.5 % (2015: 1.9%) would be required for the carrying value of further CGU’s to equal
their recoverable amount. In Brazil, an increase in discount rate of 1.0% and a decrease in growth rate of 1.9%
would be required for the carrying value of further CGU’s to be impaired.

**Property**

The property provision represents the anticipated costs of returning operating lease premises to their original
state as required by the terms of the related lease. The leases are due to expire within two to three years and
therefore the provision is expected to be utilised within this period. The level of provision is based upon an
annual review of the current condition of the building. The review is based upon internal and external
examinations of the property.

**Severance allowance and Non-compulsory insurance**

Severance allowance is paid to certain employees in Vietnam when they terminate their employment contracts
and is estimated based on a consideration of time and services rendered by employees. The provision is
calculated on the basis of a half-month salary for each employee for each year of service with the relevant Group
company and based on basic salary levels at the balance sheet date.

provision for fidelity complement in Spain and a labour litigation provision in Brazil.

The loyalty points provision represents the fair value of loyalty points awarded over the last 24 months and
management anticipate that they will be utilised over the next two years.

The fidelity complement is recognised as stated by the CBA in Spain. The provision covers the extra payments
that may be requested by staff if they comply with certain requirements. The level of provision has been
calculated by an actuary, and the release has been estimated over the next few years.

The labour litigation provision represents an amount relating to an ex-employee in Brazil.

On 26 February 2016, the Company consolidated 300 ordinary shares of £1 into a single share of £300 and then
transacted a reduction in nominal value to £1, transferring the proceeds to distributable reserves. At the same
date, the share premium account was reduced by £498,908,000 and this amount was also transferred to
distributable reserves.

_Merger reserve_

The merger reserve arose as a result of common control accounting upon the Company acquisition of Cognita
Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries during the period ended 31 August 2015. The merger reserve represents the
cumulative reserves of that group prior to the acquisition date.

_Equity reserve_

The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and is recognised in equity. The fair value determined at the
grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period,
based on the Group’s estimate of when the shares will vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based
vesting conditions.

_Translation reserve_

The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising since 1 September 2014, the transition
date to Adopted IFRSs, from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the
translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.

**25 Financial instruments**

The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, equity investments and various items,
such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are
described in more detail below. In order to manage the Group’s exposure to those risks, in particular the Group’s
exposure to interest rate risk, the Group enters into a number of derivative transactions including, but not limited
to, variable to fixed rate interest rate swaps. All transactions in derivatives are undertaken to manage the risks
arising from underlying business activities and no transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange
risk, and interest rate risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are
summarised below.

_Effect of change of inputs used in fair value measurement_

As the possibility of obtaining unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets is remote, no
analysis of the effect of changing one or more of the inputs used in fair value measurement to another reasonably
possible assumption has been prepared.

**_b) Credit risk_**

_Financial risk management_

**_Group_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and trade receivables
and the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of these
assets.

The credit risk associated with bank balances is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies.

The principal credit risk in the group therefore arises from trade receivables, which represent outstanding fees
receivable. In order to limit the risk surrounding outstanding fees, student fees are reviewed on a regular basis in
conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.

**_Company_**

The Company had no external receivables at the year end (2015: £nil) and so has no exposure to credit risk.

The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date was:

The provision account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that
no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off
against trade receivables directly.

**_c) Liquidity risk_**

**_c) Liquidity risk (continued)_**

The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and by investing cash assets safely and profitably. The Group’s policy has been to ensure continuity of funding
and where possible has relocated debt closer to operational activities in appropriate local currencies.

During the period ended 31 August 2015, the Group refinanced all debt other than that held in Brazil and Chile.
As part of this refinancing, on 21 July 2015 Cognita Bondco Parent Limited and Cognita Midco Limited were
inserted between Cognita Topco Limited and Cognita Holdings Limited. Other new companies were also
incorporated including Cognita Financing plc which issued Senior Secured Loan Notes of £280m. The Group
secured a £60m Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility to fund future borrowing requirements which can be
drawn down in a number of different currencies as required. During the year ended 31 August 2016 the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility was increased by £20m to £80m.

The Senior Secured Loan Notes mature on 15 August 2021 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 7.75%. The issue
has been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF (“Multilateral Trading Facility”).

The net proceeds were used to invest in equity of Cognita Holdings Limited and these funds were used to repay a
number of outstanding external loans within the Group along with related accrued interest and break costs, to
settle costs related to the termination of interest rate swaps and pay fees and expenses in connection with the
transactions.

The Group has a strong working capital position as student contracts require cash payment in advance of tuition
services, generally on an annual, termly or monthly basis. Trade payables are settled on the basis of credit terms
agreed with the respective suppliers.

**_d) Market risk_**

Market risk as applicable to the Group is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or
interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. These two
elements of Market risk are covered separately below.

_Market risk—Foreign exchange risk_

The Group’s results are reported in pounds Sterling. Where possible, the Group seeks to manage the effect of any
exposure that may arise from the translation of the foreign currency assets by borrowing funds denominated in
the local currency of the entity it acquires, or will use hedging instruments to mitigate the exchange risk.

Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign subsidiaries, Group exposure to currency
risk at a transactional level is minimal. The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are usually carried
out in their local currency.

**_d) Market risk (continued)_**

_Sensitivity analysis—Group_

If sterling had been 10% stronger / weaker at 31 August, Group equity would have decreased / increased by
£8,735,000 (2015: £4,073,000). This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the Balance Sheet date and
had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

_Market risk—Interest rate risk_

The Group finances its operations through third party borrowings and in the form of Senior Secured Loan Notes
which carry a fixed rate of interest of 7.75%. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable
interest rate bank borrowings is managed by the use of hedging. It is the Group’s policy to use fixed interest rate
hedging instruments to hedge at least 50% of its bank borrowings.

The interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 August 2016 is shown in the
table below. The table includes trade debtors and creditors which do not attract interest but are subject to fair
value interest rate risk.

All financial assets and liabilities identified as fixed rate instruments in the above table are accruing interest at
rates that are fixed for the life of the instrument. Interest rate swaps are disclosed above at fair value as fixed rate
instruments, whilst the loans that they are hedging are disclosed as variable rate instruments.

_Sensitivity analysis_

At 31 August 2016, the Group had exposure to interest rate sensitivity in respect of variable rate loans held in
Brazil. In respect of the floating rate loans held in Brazil, an interest rate SWAP is in place to cover exposure to
interest rate fluctuations. In respect of these loans, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates
over the year would have increased / decreased the result for the year by £305,528 (2015: £279,000).

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers
the effect of all financial instruments with variable interest rates. The analysis is performed on the same basis for
2015.

**_e) Capital management_**

**_Group and Company_**

The Group manages its capital to safeguard its ability to operate as a going concern and to optimise returns to
shareholders. Overdraft and revolving credit facilities will be used to finance the working capital cycle if

commitment of £3,699,000.

The Group entered into a contract in Thailand for a campus development during the period ended 31 August

**28 Contingencies**

**Group Guarantees**

During the period ended 31 August 2015, the Group restructured its debt which involved the formation of new
companies within the Group, including subsidiary undertaking Cognita Financing plc. Cognita Financing plc
issued Senior Secured Loan Notes which are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF Market.
Cognita Bondco Parent Limited and certain subsidiary undertakings are guarantors on a senior basis. Under this
arrangement, the assets of the Group companies are subject to a fixed and floating charge.

The total gross exposure in relation to the Senior Secured Loan Notes was £280.5m (2015: £281.5m) including
accrued interest at the end of the year. The Guarantors also grant a senior guarantee of a Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility agreement concurrently with the Senior Secured Loan Notes guarantee. The Group also
guarantees the loan facilities and deferred consideration in Brazil, Chile and Hong Kong, with a total exposure of
£94.0m (2015: £45.8m).

**Reinstatement of leased land**

The Group is disclosing a contingent liability in relation to reinstatement costs of leasehold land on which it has
constructed school buildings. The terms in the lease contract provide the landlord with an option of reinstating
the leased land to its original preconstruction condition.

Management have reviewed the contract from a legal perspective and considered other relevant factors in
determining the likely outcome on lease expiry. As a consequence of this review, it has been concluded that
whilst a requirement for reinstatement is possible upon expiry of the lease, it is not probable and therefore no
provision should be recognised in this respect.

It has been estimated that the maximum liability at 31 August 2016 should a reinstatement be required would be
£3,804,000 (2015: £5,516,000). This estimated contingent liability represents the cost of demolition of the entire
area of construction including substructure, extraction of piles, back filling to original levels and re-turfing.

**Litigation**

The Group received claims in respect of a potential litigation associated with the criminal conduct of a former
teacher at Southbank International School. The Group maintains insurance cover and has been advised such
cover will be adequate to cover the full amount of any potential claims.

**Tax claims**

The Group has received assessments from HMRC in the aggregate amount of £1,179,000 with respect to PAYE
and NI in connection with the operation of a former management securities plan in the tax years between
2009/2010 and 2012/2013. The net exposure arising from the assessment is deemed to be £500,000. The Group
has appealed these assessments on the basis of guidance from their advisors and no provision has been made.

**Company**

During the year ended 31 August 2016, subsidiary undertaking Cognita Financing PLC loaned £271,381,000
(2015: £274,532,000) to the Company. The loan carries a fixed rate of interest of 8.25% and is repayable in
August 2021.

Also during the year ended 31 August 2016, subsidiary undertaking Cognita Holdings Limited loaned £83,000 to
the Company (2015: £6,628,000 was loaned by the Company to the subsidiary undertaking). The loan is
non-interest bearing.

**30 Ultimate parent company and parent company of larger group**

The immediate parent company is Cognita Midco Limited, a company registered in England and Wales which is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Cognita Topco Limited, a company registered in Jersey.

The ultimate controlling parties are The Bregal Fund III LP and Crimson Cayman Holding Limited, who jointly
control the Company. On 9 October 2015, a share rebalancing agreement was executed between the ultimate
parent company’s shareholders Crimson Cayman Holding Limited, which is controlled by KKR European Fund
III LP and The Bregal Fund III LP. The effect of this agreement was to both equalise the economic and voting
rights in the Company between these shareholders.

**31 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are set out and described in note 1, the Directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**31 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)**

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.

**Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately
below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies
and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

_Classification of Singapore land lease—decommission liability_

The Group has entered into two land leases in Singapore, upon which school buildings have been constructed.
Note 28 describes the reinstatement clauses included in the lease contracts. Significant judgement is required in
determining the likelihood that reinstatement of the land will be required upon expiry of the lease. In making its
judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingent
liabilities set out in IAS 37. Following this work management are satisfied that reinstatement costs are not
probable and therefore it is most appropriate to disclose a contingent liability in the financial statements.
Consequently an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the building and restoring the site to its
original state at the end of the lease term has been obtained.

_Revenue recognition—Development/facility fees_

The Group recognises development and facility fees over the tenure or expected tenure of a student within a
school. The Group’s management determines the estimated tenure of a student in order to recognise development
and facility fee revenue over the period of service provision. The estimated tenure is calculated on a school by
school basis using an analytical method based on historical statistics, adjusted for known or anticipated trends.

In making its judgement to apply this recognition basis, management considered the detailed criteria for the
recognition of revenue in the context of linked transactions set out in IAS 18 Revenue, in particular, the
considerations surrounding the length of service provision. Estimates made by management regarding the
calculation of tenure or expected tenure are discussed below.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year, are discussed below.

_Share based payments_

In accordance with IFRS 2, share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The valuation
requires a number of assumptions to be made based on factors outside the Group’s control, such as vesting period
and employee leavers.

_Fair value of assets and liabilities attributable to business combinations_

All business acquisitions made following the transition to IFRS are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3
which requires that all assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of
acquisition. In addition the Group performs a purchase price allocation for each acquisition which identified the
separable intangible assets acquired as part of each business combination. To establish the fair value of these
separable intangible assets, the Group has to make assumptions in relation to the potential future cash flows
relating to these assets which involved assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount
rates and the useful life of such assets.

**Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)**

**31 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)**

_Impairment of goodwill_

The Group is required to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually. This requires the Group to
estimate the value in use of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated. The value
in use calculation requires an estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the
CGU and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate.

Management’s estimation of cash flows is based upon the current budgets and forecasts which are established
using management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The estimation of discount rate is considered on a case
by case basis and is achieved using a number of different methodologies which consider current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.

_Provisions_

The Group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date. The
amount of provision recognised is dependent upon management’s estimation of the likely outcome. At the
balance sheet date, provisions included amounts for lease dilapidations and employee termination.

Provisions are reviewed on a regular basis, according to management’s best current estimates and are adjusted
accordingly. Due to the inherent estimates and assumptions required upon the recognition of a provision, the
amount required to settle a provision can be different to the provision recognised at the balance sheet date.

_Recoverability of trade receivables_

An estimation is required to determine the recoverability of fees receivable when collection of the full amount is
not considered virtually certain. At the balance sheet date, all schools assess the recoverability of trade
receivables and records a provision for doubtful debts based on knowledge of individual circumstances as well as
historic empirical evidence of recoverability based on relative ageing of fees receivable.

Where there is evidence that a fee will not be recovered, the fee receivable asset will be derecognised and a bad
debt charge will be recognised in the income statement.

Due to the use of estimates, sometimes there will be a difference between amounts collected in future periods
related to fees receivable recognised at the balance sheet date. The difference between the carrying amount of the
fee receivable on the balance sheet and the amount actually collected in a future period is recognised in the
consolidated statement of income.

_Deferred tax assets_

In order to determine the recoverability and therefore recognition of deferred tax assets, the Group must estimate
the probable future taxable profits, against which the temporary timing differences can be utilised. This estimate
requires the use of current budgets and forecasts to determine future taxable profits and the timing of when these
will be realised.

Management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date and if it is considered
probable that all, or a part of the deferred tax asset will not be utilised within 5 years, the asset is derecognised.

On 6 September 2016, the Group acquired 100% shareholding in The English Montessori School, a school based
in Madrid, Spain. The consideration, which was funded following a drawdown on the Revolving Credit Facility,
was approximately €10.1m (c. £8.6m).

The school is an independent British school offering education to students aged 3-18 years. The schools had
c.790 students at the date of acquisition, with a current capacity of c.1,000.

On 19 September 2016, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility was increased by £20m from £80m at
31 August 2016 to £100m.

On 26 September 2016, the Cognita Group acquired the remaining 49% of share capital in the Desarrollos
Educacionales group. This led to a £7.7m increase in the company investment in Cognita Funding 1 Limited.

On 4 October 2016, Cognita Financing plc, a Cognita Group subsidiary undertaking, made a further issue of
£45m of Senior Secured Loan Notes which are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange—Euro MTF Market.
These Loan Notes, which carry the same maturity and fixed interest rate of 7.75% were issued under the same
indenture as the initial issuance. A premium of £2.0m to par value was recognised upon the issuance of these
instruments. The guarantor status of the company applies to both the initial and subsequent issuances.
