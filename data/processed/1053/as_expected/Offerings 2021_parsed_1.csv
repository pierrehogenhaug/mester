1053_1,Offerings 2021.md,2254,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION,2254.1,,2254.1.1,,"EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations and Adjusted Operating Margin (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”), as presented in this offering memorandum, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures of operating performance. Additionally, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not used as, and are not intended to be, measures of cash flow in accordance with GAAP. For the definitions of, and more information about, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our method of calculating the Non-GAAP Financial Measures may vary from the method used by other companies. In addition, in calculating the Non-GAAP Financial Measures we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. The items excluded from the Non-GAAP Financial Measures are significant in assessing our operating results and liquidity. We present the Non-GAAP Financial Measures because we believe that investors consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Additionally, we believe issuers of non-investment grade securities present the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the related ratio data because investors, analysts and rating agencies consider them useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these ----- limitations are that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures (i) do not reflect all our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; (iii) do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and the Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; (v) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (vi) are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate the Non-GAAP Financial Measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using the Non-GAAP Financial Measures only for supplemental purposes. The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use of non-GAAP financial measures in registration statements filed under the Securities Act, such as the Non-GAAP Financial Measures, that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the Issuer’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - exclusion of non-cash charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity measures; - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur; and - presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the GAAP financial statements (or notes thereto) or any pro forma financial information. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with these rules. See “No Review by the SEC; No Registration Rights.” For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss), EBITDA Margin to net income (loss) margin, Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net income margin, Free Cash Flow to cash provided by operating activities, Adjusted Cost of Sales to cost of sales, Adjusted Gross Profit to gross profit, Adjusted Gross Margin to gross margin, Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses to selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations to income from operations, and Adjusted Operating Margin to operating margin, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Our social and digital marketing is centered on showcasing our clog and sandal silhouettes and our Jibbitz™charms.

We are expanding our sandal offerings as we pursue a greater share of a large market that currently has no clear global leader. We are continuing to invest in designer, celebrity, and brand collaborations, as well as celebrity brand ambassadors to raise consumer engagement with our brand. Our collaborations help further drive brand heat and relevance by improving social engagement through locally relevant platforms. In 2020, we pivoted branding to better connect with consumers by launching the “A Free Pair for Healthcare” initiative to help deliver over 860,000 free shoes to front-line healthcare and other essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The DTC channel drove 50% of total revenues in 2020 and includes both retail and e-commerce channels. Our wholesale channel contributed the other 50% of total revenues in 2020 and is comprised of e-tailers, distributors and other brick-and-mortar (“B&M”) retailers. Digital sales are reported within both wholesale and DTC and include e-tailers, our companyowned websites and third-party marketplaces. (1) Channel breakdown reflects the year ended December 31, 2020. _Wholesale Channel_ During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 50.0%, 53.3%, and 53.1% of revenues, respectively, were derived through our wholesale channel. Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international, multi-brand, B&M retailers, e-tailers, and distributors in certain countries, including partner store operators. B&M customers typically include family footwear retailers, national and regional retail chains, sporting goods stores, and independent footwear retailers. In 2020, as a result of COVID-19, many of our wholesale B&M retailers were closed for a portion of the year. Globally, our products are also offered on prominent e-tail platforms including Amazon, Zappos and Zalando. Outside the U.S., we use distributors when we believe such arrangements are economically preferable to direct sales. Distributors purchase products pursuant to a price list and are granted the right to resell those ----- products in a defined territory, usually a country or group of countries. Our typical distribution agreements have terms of one to five years and can be terminated or renegotiated if minimum requirements or other terms are not met. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our distributors’ stores were closed for a portion of the year and in many cases experienced lower traffic due to the decline in tourism. No single wholesale customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our total revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. _E-commerce Channel_ As of December 31, 2020, we offered our products through 13 company-operated e-commerce sites worldwide and also on third-party marketplaces, such as Tmall, VIP, Rakuten and eBay.

Our e-commerce presence facilitates increased access to our consumers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brand. We continue to leverage digital marketing activities to promote a seamless consumer experience and drive sales, thereby benefiting from the continued migration of consumers to online shopping. The e-commerce channel is a fast-growing distribution channel driven by accelerated consumer adoption, performance-driven marketing and expanded digital reach. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, digital penetration was 42% and 31% of sales, respectively. Since 2015, we have taken a digital-first approach to the brand, focusing on platform strength, experience and partnerships. As a result, we have been able to sustain double-digit e-commerce revenue growth for 15 consecutive quarters. Our robust digital strategy has included making early investments in first- and third-party mix optimization by country and region, while also investing in our people and technologies to elevate customer experience. These efforts support increasing customer brand affinity and higher conversion through relevant content. In accelerating our digital platform investment, we have executed retention strategies around data, segmentation and personalization.

Market Leader in Clog Category with Significant Whitespace in Sandals and Personalization._** Our product line is anchored by four pillars — clogs, sandals, Jibbitz™charms and visible comfort technology. We are the market leader in the clog category with an opportunity to further grow the category. According to a study by L.E.K. Consulting, the clog category grew to an estimated $5.0 billion annual market size in 2018. The clog category is believed to have outpaced growth of overall casual footwear from 2015 to 2018. We are the market leader in the growing clogs category with approximately 20.0% market share as of December 31, 2020. Our clog revenue increased by approximately 33% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 72% of total footwear revenues, up from 60% of total footwear revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. Key drivers of clog growth include innovations, colors and prints, impactful collaborations, and personalization with Jibbitz™. The casual sandal category was estimated to be a $30.0 billion annual market in 2018 according to L.E.K. Consulting and is believed to have grown in line with overall casual footwear from 2015 to 2018. We have an opportunity to significantly grow share in the sandals category, which is highly fragmented with no dominant players. Our sandal revenue had grown by over 10.0% for each of the three years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We look forward to a full sandal season in 2021 and restoring sandal growth by building on the early successes of the Brooklyn, Tulum, and Classic Slide products as well as introducing a new Two-Strap Classic Sandal. In addition, we have leveraged personalization trends to grow both clogs and sandals through our Jibbitz™charms.

Jibbitz™sales accelerated in the year ended December 31, 2020, nearly doubling in revenues as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Jibbitz™consumers are highly valuable due to the fact that, based on management’s estimates, they have an approximately two times greater customer lifetime value as compared to clog, sandals and work product customers.

We have strong, long-standing relationships with our top 20 global B&M accounts, of which 10 are in the U.S. Within the DTC channel, we have a rapidly growing e-commerce platform, driven by early investment in digital infrastructure and technologies.

International revenue represented 42% of total revenues in 2020. We have a strong network of international distributors. Our distributor model allows us to expand internationally in a less capital intensive way. In 2020, we experienced greater than 10.0% year-over-year growth in our owned e-commerce sites across all of our geographical regions. In recent years, we have seen the strongest growth in our Americas segment and believe there is continued opportunity for significant growth in our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments. In 2020, Americas segment revenue growth was 34.8%, driven by e-commerce growth, wholesale growth and strong retail comparable store sales. Of our 2020 Americas segment revenue, 45% was from wholesale, 29% was from retail and 26% was from e-commerce. Our performance in the U.S. in particular is the direct result of our commitment to driving relevance with the consumer through our iconic products and innovative marketing. In 2020, our EMEA segment benefited from strong brand momentum and delivered 29.7% DTC comparable sales, accelerating from 13.3% in 2019. In Asia, DTC comparable sales were 9.6% in 2020, accelerating from 5.6% in 2019, with the strongest performance in South Korea. We have also built on recent momentum and have started to realize the brand’s potential in China, which is the second largest footwear market in the world according to Statista. We believe that Crocs is underpenetrated in China as sales in China represented less than 5% of 2020 sales. To support international growth, construction began in 2020 on a new EMEA distribution center in the Netherlands, which is expected to be fully operational in 2021, and we completed the relocation of our third-party operated Asia Pacific distribution center within Japan. ----- ###### FY2020 Revenue by Geography Americas 62% EMEA 18% Asia Pacific 20%",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

First, with respect to our clogs, we plan to innovate through new graphics, licensed images, embellishments, and accessories, such as Jibbitz™charms, that allow for personalization. In sandals, we are expanding our offerings as we pursue a greater share of a large market that currently has no clear global leader. We believe there is a large share growth opportunity for us in sandals, which accounted for approximately 18.0% of our footwear sales in 2020. Recent product introductions have included the Classic Slide, Two-Strap Classic Sandal, Brooklyn and Tulum. In addition to these offerings, we plan to capitalize on our unique selling proposition for sandals, which is the ability to personalize the Classic Slide and Two-Strap Classic Sandal at the point of sale with our Jibbitz™charms. We believe a key driver of clog and sandal relevance is personalization through our Jibbitz™charms, which aligns to the global industry trend of personalization. Jibbitz™enhance the consumer experience by providing an outlet for storytelling and heightening our message of “Come As You Are™.” Jibbitz™charms are a driver of ASP and overall clog sales, while expanding the originality and uniqueness of the Crocs line of products. Based on management’s estimates, customers who purchase Jibbitz™charms have approximately twice the customer lifetime value of customers who only purchase clogs, sandals and work shoes.

In 2020 and continuing into 2021, our global brand ambassadors include actress and activist Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who resonates with the global consumer base, and leading Chinese actress Yang Mi, who helped grow brand awareness and brand resonance in China. In 2020, our innovative and creative collaborations ranged from global launches with Justin Bieber and Post Malone to more regional partnerships like Rare Market in Korea or Liberty London in EMEA. Our collaborations help grow brand relevance and fuel brand heat. We plan to leverage regional collaborations to increase brand awareness internationally and scale international markets. In addition, we shifted to an all-digital marketing approach several years ago and we plan to continue to leverage increasingly sophisticated digital marketing activities to enhance the consumer experience and drive sales, thereby benefiting from the continued migration of consumers to online shopping. Our social and digital marketing showcases our unique product assortment and helps create exceptional consumer engagement. The Crocs brand has evolved over the past four years, increasing desirability, relevance and consideration, with approximately 64% global aided brand awareness as of the end of 2020, according to our estimates. ----- Grow our Distribution Channels with a Focus on Digital._** From a channel perspective, digital remains our top priority. Our digital channel, which includes e-commerce and e-tail, reached 42% of revenues in 2020, driven by our strategic investment in the channel and growing consumer preference for digital shopping. In 2020, we experienced 10.0% year-over-year growth in our owned e-commerce sites across all of our geographies. Our e-commerce presence facilitates increased access to our consumers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brand. We plan to further invest in the channel through scaling of technologies and talent, along with supply chain investments. In 2020, we doubled our e-commerce distribution capacity in the U.S. Our planned 2021 distribution center investments are intended to support our digital-first strategy by increasing e-commerce capacity, which should allow us to better serve our online customers. We also intend to increase sales within our wholesale channel by focusing on e-tail accounts and distributors, which we believe present the greatest growth opportunities within this channel. We believe we have the opportunity to gain market share with our major wholesale customers, both B&M as well as e-tail, particularly as we grow our sandals offerings. We also believe we can significantly grow Jibbitz[TM] in the wholesale environment, particularly through multipack packaging, which makes it easier for our wholesale partners to display and sell products. We have an opportunity to further grow our international wholesale accounts, particularly through our distributor model. Our focus with our distributor partners is to continue to elevate the Crocs brand, accelerate personalization and drive digital growth. Finally, with respect to our retail channel, we do not anticipate significant growth in our footprint. We may selectively add stores in markets such as China, where store presence is important for brand awareness, and we may also selectively close locations in certain markets. We will also continue to prioritize our company-operated outlet stores, our most profitable retail format. Focus on Increasing our International Sales through Brand Building and Digital Acceleration._** Our international revenues, which includes revenues from all segments outside of the U.S., accounted for 42% of our total revenues in 2020. We believe that our Americas segment has the largest near-term growth opportunity followed by our EMEA segment, and that our Asia Pacific segment represents the segment with the largest long-term growth potential. Going forward, we intend to concentrate on driving increased revenue in each of our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments through brand building, product expansion and pricing actions. We plan to build international brand relevance through local collaborations and targeted marketing campaigns. Americas brand momentum continues to help grow Crocs relevance in EMEA. We have built on that brand heat through local collaborations and positive media, having recently collaborated with French DJ, Vladimir Cauchemar. In Asia Pacific, China is a top priority given it is the second largest footwear market in the world according to Statista and we believe we are currently underpenetrated in China with less than 5% of our total revenues in 2020. We are building brand awareness in China through significant marketing investment and our brand ambassador Yang Mi. We are also renovating our store fleet, investing in digital and hiring talent. We intend to further accelerate our international growth through our focus on digital via our owned e-commerce channel as well as e-tail. Both EMEA and Asia Pacific e-commerce channels grew significantly in 2020, with growth of 47.0% and 21.9%, respectively. ###### Accelerated Digital Growth in FY2020 _% Digital Penetration_ 55% 42% 31% 39% 39% 40% 30% 28% Americas Asia Pacific EMEA FY2019 FY2020 FY2019 Global FY2020 Global -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

(2) In the three months ended December 31, 2020, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights, primarily to align with current and future international operations. The transfer resulted in a step-up in tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual property rights. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of $127.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. (3) On December 5, 2018, all issued and outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred”) were repurchased in exchange for cash or converted to common stock. As a result, amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2018 include amounts resulting from the repurchase and conversion, in addition to payments made to induce conversion and accretion of dividend equivalents prior to December 5, 2018. (4) Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the impacts of $183.7 million used to repurchase Series A Preferred in 2018 and $120.0 million of borrowings. Cash used in financing activities also includes approximately $170.8 million, $147.2 million and $63.1 million, including commissions, used to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (5) Prior year amounts have not been recast to reflect adoption of revenue recognition guidance as of January 1, 2018, which impacts ‘Total Assets,’ or adoption of new lease guidance as of January 1, 2019, which impacts ‘Working capital’, ‘Total assets’, and ‘Long-term liabilities.’ (6) We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDA Margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as further adjusted for the Cost of Sales Adjustments (as defined below) and the Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Adjustments (each as defined below). We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues. We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, equipment, and software. We define Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales, as adjusted for (i) new distribution centers expenses, (ii) COVID-19 inventory write-off, and (iii) other expenses (collectively, the “Cost of Sales Adjustments”). We define Adjusted Gross Profit as revenue, less Adjusted Cost of Sales. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenues. We define Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses as selling, general and administrative expenses, as adjusted for (i) donations of inventory, (ii) COVID-19 severance costs, (iii) COVID-19 impact of bad debt expense, (iv) other COVID-19 costs, (v) acceleration depreciation of assets, (vi) asset impairments, (vii) duplicate headquarters rent, (viii) non-recurring expenses associated with cost reduction initiatives, (ix) offering fees, (x) closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities and (xi) other expenses (collectively, the “Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Adjustments”). ----- We define Adjusted Income from Operations as income from operations, as adjusted for the Cost of Sales Adjustments and the Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Adjustments. We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Income from Operations divided by revenues. We believe that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures presented in this offering memorandum can provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), net income (loss) margin, cash provided by operating activities, cost of sales, gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, and operating margin, as applicable, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies. We believe that the presentation of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures provide indicators of performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on the Non-GAAP Financial Measures for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures allow management to compare our results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. However, other companies may define the Non-GAAP Financial Measures differently, and as a result, our definitions of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. The non-GAAP information presented above and elsewhere in this offering memorandum should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss), EBITDA Margin to net income (loss) margin, Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net income margin, Free Cash Flow to cash provided by operating activities, Adjusted Cost of Sales to cost of sales, Adjusted Gross Profit to gross profit, Adjusted Gross Margin to gross margin, Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses to selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations to income from operations, and Adjusted Operating Margin to operating margin, respectively:",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers (as defined herein, including certain foreign subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes), including us, and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $180.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, with total borrowing capacity of approximately $319.4 million thereunder (including $0.6 million of letters of credit outstanding as of such date), all of which would be secured indebtedness. If a default or an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement (as defined herein), the holders of such secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our secured assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the Notes, even if we are in default with respect to the Notes. In that event, our secured assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the Notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all of the holders of our other unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the Notes, and potentially with all of our other general unsecured creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Notes. As a result, holders of the Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness. In addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be substantial.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Subject to the limits contained in the Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the applicable agreements governing our other existing indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could increase. Specifically, our level of debt could have important consequences, including the following: - making it more difficult for us to meet our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Notes; - reducing the availability of cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; ----- - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; - placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; - increasing our cost of borrowing; and - limiting our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Although certain of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, including the Indenture, contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.” Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional Notes under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes— Principal, Maturity and Interest.” To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor would increase. Furthermore, if we incur secured indebtedness and such secured indebtedness is either accelerated or becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and the assets of any guarantors thereunder would be used to satisfy obligations with respect to the indebtedness secured thereby before any payment could be made on the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, the Indenture also does not restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries from incurring additional debt, which debt would be structurally senior to the Notes. In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us and our subsidiaries from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $180.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, with total borrowing capacity of approximately $319.4 million thereunder (including $0.6 million of letters of credit outstanding as of such date), all of which would be secured indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

On the issue date, only our whollyowned restricted subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under our Revolving Credit Facility will initially guarantee the Notes. In the future, each of our wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor under any syndicated credit facility or capital markets debt of the Issuer or any guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of a certain amount will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions. Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these nonguarantor subsidiaries and will not be satisfied from the assets of these non-guarantor subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full. As of December 31, 2020, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the offering of the Notes, but not the use of proceeds therefrom, the Notes would have ranked effectively subordinated to $180.0 million of secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (with a further approximately $319.4 million available for borrowing under ----- the Revolving Credit Facility (including $0.6 million of letters of credit outstanding as of such date). See “Capitalization.” As of December 31, 2020, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the offering of the Notes, but not the use of proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries collectively would have held approximately 30.4% of our consolidated assets and would have had approximately $0.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries collectively generated approximately 30.6% of our revenues and approximately 10.2% of our Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, the Guarantee of certain Guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such Guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture or upon certain other events described in “Description of Notes—Note Guarantees.” The Indenture will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness thereunder.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

As a result, interest rates on variable rate debt could be higher or lower than current levels. As of December 31, 2020, all of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. In addition, certain of our variable rate indebtedness, including our Revolving Credit Facility, use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past.

These restrictions in the Credit Agreement and Indenture will limit the ability of the Borrowers to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt, incur certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates and transfer or sell certain assets.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the Notes or Guarantees were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the Notes or a Guarantee and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the Notes or the Guarantees; - the issuance of the Notes or the Guarantees left the Issuer or any of the Guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which the Issuer or such Guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or such Guarantee or further subordinate the Notes or such Guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the voidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the Guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a Guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the Guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the Notes and the Guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: ----- - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or such Guarantee and/or lien if the Issuer or such Guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable Guarantee and/or lien. To the extent proceeds of the offering are used to fund payments to equityholders, a court could conclude that we did not receive reasonably equivalent value. In addition, if the Guarantees were legally challenged, any Guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the Guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the Guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable Guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes. To the extent a court avoids any of the Guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers or holds any of the Guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of Notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable Guarantor. If a court were to hold a Guarantee unenforceable, the applicable Guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable Guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the Guarantee of the Notes. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining Guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor. Although each Guarantee entered into in connection with the Notes will contain a provision intended to limit that Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its Guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those Guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the Notes or by a Guarantor under a Guarantee made at a time the Issuer or such Guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or Guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the Guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the Notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Any future issuance of a Guarantee, including pursuant to Guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the Notes are issued, may be avoidable by the Guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the Guarantor is insolvent at the time of the issuance of the Guarantee, (2) the issuance of the Guarantee permits the ----- holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the Guarantee had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the Guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the Guarantee, or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if the Issuer or any Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the Notes and any Guarantees not issued on the issue date of the Notes had been issued less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such Guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the Notes (even if the other Guarantees issued on the issue date of the Notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such Guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the Guarantee.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of any future Guarantor of the Notes, such that it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. Also, the insolvency laws of such other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar. In addition, while the Issuer and the Guarantors will agree, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture that will govern the Notes, to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture that will govern the Notes or the Notes brought in any federal or state court located in New York City by an agent designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings, it may be difficult for holders of the Notes to effect service within the U.S. upon directors, officers and experts who are not residents of the U.S. in order to institute actions in U.S. courts predicated solely upon civil liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. There may be doubt as to the enforceability in non-U.S. jurisdictions in original actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. You should not assume that the non-U.S. jurisdictions: (a) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S.; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

The source of funds for any such purchase of the Notes will be the Issuer’s available cash or cash generated from the Issuer’s operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer may not be able to purchase the Notes upon such an asset sale offer because the Issuer may not have sufficient financial resources at the time of such asset sale to make the required purchase of Notes and such other indebtedness, or because restrictions in the Issuer’s other indebtedness will not allow such purchase of the Notes.

Despite this, in 2020, we saw strong sales in e-commerce and strong sell-through in e-tail and wholesale partner sites, as consumers migrated to online shopping. The vast majority of our 351 companyoperated stores were open at December 31, 2020. To ensure the well-being of our employees and customers, our corporate offices, retail stores, and distribution centers have implemented various elevated safety protocols, in accordance with local guidelines and regulations, including temperature checks, mandatory mask policies, social distancing, access to hand sanitizer, plexiglass partitions, and enhanced cleaning of the facilities. Our corporate offices have also actively managed attendance levels in accordance with local guidelines and regulations, and many of our corporate employees have continued to successfully conduct business virtually. We expect these measures to continue into 2021 until the population is vaccinated for COVID-19 to such a degree that these measures are no longer necessary. - Digital growth, which was a priority in 2020 and a growing consumer trend, remains a key focus for 2021, along with a focus on clogs, sandals, personalization, and visible comfort technology, and growth in China, which remains a significant long-term opportunity. Digital sales include sales through our company-owned website, third-party marketplaces, and e-tailers. - We expect revenue growth in 2021, primarily driven by our Americas and EMEA segments, and expect to incur costs affecting gross margin for investments in our distribution center network. Additionally, we plan to be able to continue leveraging SG&A as revenues grows in 2021. - We were cash flow positive for the year ended December 31, 2020, despite the negative impacts of the global pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we have returned to standard payment terms with our customers and vendors after encountering term extension requests from some customers and more strictly managing accounts payable in the first part of the year.

The increase in 2020 revenues compared to 2019 revenues was due to the net effects of: (i) higher sales volumes, which increased revenues by $24.5 million, or 2.0%; (ii) higher average selling prices as a result of favorable channel mix, reduced discounts and promotions, and increased prices on certain products, which increased revenues by $141.5 million, or 11.5%; and (iii) unfavorable changes in exchange rates, which decreased revenues by $10.6 million, or 0.9%. The following were significant developments affecting our businesses and capital structure during the year ended December 31, 2020: - Digital sales represented 41.5% of 2020 revenues, compared to 31.1% in 2019. Direct-to-consumer comparable sales grew 39.2% in 2020, compared to 2019. - We sold 69.1 million pairs of shoes worldwide, an increase from 67.1 million pairs in 2019, despite volume declines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. - Gross margin was 54.1% compared to 50.1% in 2019, an increase of 400 basis points, primarily as a result of fewer promotions, favorable product mix, higher pricing, and increased sales of charms per shoe. - SG&A was $514.8 million, an increase of $26.3 million, or 5.4%, compared to 2019. As a percent of revenues, SG&A improved 260 basis points to 37.1% of revenues, as reductions from several actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the elimination of certain temporary and permanent corporate and regional roles and a reduction in travel and related costs, were offset by higher variable costs associated with higher revenues and costs incurred as a result of COVID-19, including $9.9 million of inventory donations to frontline healthcare workers and other organizations. - We recognized $21.1 million in asset impairments, related primarily to a retail store location in New York City. - Income from operations was $214.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to income from operations of $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our operating margin rose to 15.4%, compared to 10.5% in 2019. - In December 2020, we completed a series of transactions that included a transfer of certain intellectual property rights among wholly-owned subsidiaries and resulted in the recognition of a $127.7 million tax benefit. - Net income was $312.9 million compared to $119.5 million in 2019.

Revenues._** Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had the most significant adverse impact on sales in the first half of the year, revenues increased for the full year ended December 31, 2020. Sales volumes, which were lower in all regions in the first two quarters of the year, rebounded in the second half of the year, as retail locations, partner stores, and B&M retailers reopened as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. Increased ASP, especially in the Americas, was the largest contributor to higher revenues in 2020, as a result of fewer promotions and discounts, higher pricing on certain products, channel mix from higher sales in our e-commerce channel, which typically sells at a higher price, and increased sales of charms per shoe. Our continued focus on digital commerce, which was further bolstered by consumer migration to online shopping during the pandemic, led to an increase of 58.2% in e-commerce channel revenues. Currency fluctuations, primarily in the Brazilian Real, Russian Ruble, and Korean Won, had a negative impact on revenues. ----- Cost of sales._** Cost of sales increased compared to 2019 due to higher average cost per unit on a constant currency basis (“AUC”) of $9.5 million, or 1.5%, due to increased e-commerce sales, which carry higher freight and fulfillment costs. Additionally, AUC increased as a result of continued investment in our global supply chain during 2020. Higher sales volume of $18.1 million, or 3.0%, also increased cost of sales, while foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in cost of sales of $5.1 million, or 0.8%. Gross profit._** Gross margin was 54.1% compared to 50.1% in 2019, while gross profit increased $132.9 million, or 21.5%. This was primarily a result of net higher ASP and AUC, which led to an increase of $132.0 million, or 21.4%, due to fewer promotions and discounts, favorable product mix, and higher pricing. Additionally, higher volume increased gross profit by $6.3 million, or 1.0%, while negative currency fluctuations decreased gross profit by $5.4 million, or 0.9% Selling, general and administrative expenses._** SG&A increased $26.3 million, or 5.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. SG&A was higher due to inventory donations of $9.9 million to frontline healthcare workers and other organizations, net higher marketing costs of $9.5 million due to higher variable marketing associated with increased e-commerce sales, and higher bad debt expense of $4.2 million, mostly due to the impacts of COVID-19 on certain global distributors, and other net increases, including higher variable compensation and sales commissions, of $2.7 million. However, SG&A improved as a percent of sales by 260 basis points to 37.1% from 39.7% in 2019. This was primarily a result of higher revenues leveraging our fixed cost base, coupled with several actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the elimination of certain temporary and permanent corporate and regional roles and a decrease in travel and related costs. Asset impairment charges._** During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $20.0 million in impairment charges to the right-of-use asset and store assets for a retail location in New York City and $1.1 million in impairment charges to the right-of-use asset for our former corporate headquarters. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred no impairment charges. Foreign currency gains (losses), net._** Foreign currency gains (losses), net, consists of unrealized and realized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $1.1 million compared to net losses of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Income tax benefit._** During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $105.9 million on pre-tax book income of $207.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of (51.2)%, compared to income tax benefit of $0.2 million on pre-tax book income of $119.3 million in 2019, which represented an effective tax rate of (0.1)%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a foreign deferred income tax benefit as a result of an intra-entity intellectual property rights transfer, resulting in a lower effective tax rate as compared to 2019. Our effective tax rate has varied dramatically in recent years due to the intra-entity intellectual property rights transfer, differences in our profitability level and relative operating earnings across multiple jurisdictions. and by changes in the valuation allowance. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights primarily to align with current and future international operations. The transfer resulted in a step-up in tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual property rights. We recorded a deferred tax asset of $492.5 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $197.0 million, and further reduced by a valuation allowance of $167.8 million. Based on available objective evidence, management believes that $167.8 million of the deferred tax asset, to the extent not offset by reserves for uncertain tax positions, is not more-likely-than-not to be realizable as of December 31, 2020 and, therefore, is offset by a valuation allowance. As such, a net deferred tax asset of $127.7 million was recognized along with a corresponding foreign deferred income tax benefit. Our valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of tax attributes recorded in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets ----- will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In assessing our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020, we considered all available evidence, including the magnitude of recent and current operating results, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our historical experience utilizing tax attributes prior to their expiration dates, the historical volatility of operating results of these jurisdictions, and our assessment regarding the sustainability of their profitability. The weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. Certain jurisdictions for which we have historically recorded significant valuation allowances now have a sufficient history of sustained profitability as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, not associated with the intra-entity intellectual property rights transfer, decreased by $20.2 million. The 2020 impact of changes in valuation allowances to the effective tax rate was an unfavorable impact of $143.0 million, equating to a 69.0% unfavorable impact. There is also a $4.6 million change in the valuation allowance related to cumulative translation adjustments. We maintain valuation allowances of approximately $226.7 million as of December 31, 2020, which may be reduced in the future depending upon the achieved profitability of certain jurisdictions as well as the magnitude of the profitability. In 2017, we began operating under a tax holiday in one of our foreign jurisdictions. This tax holiday is in effect through 2022, and may be extended if certain additional requirements are met.

E-commerce revenues, which increased 80.9%, and wholesale revenues, which increased 42.0%, contributed to this growth, while we also saw growth in retail revenues of 3.1%, despite temporary store closures for part of the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. ASP increased in all channels as a result of less promotional activity, product mix, price increases, and increased sales of charms per shoe, while higher volumes in our e-commerce and wholesale channels more than offset lower volume in our retail channel. This was in part a result of COVID-19-related closures that drove a consumer shift to online shopping. Income from Operations._** During the year ended December 31, 2020, income from operations for our Americas segment was $361.9 million, an increase of $157.1 million, or 76.7% from 2019. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $174.1 million, or 48.9%, and gross margin increased 590 basis points to 61.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit increased $132.7 million, or 37.3%, due to higher ASP and lower AUC. ASP increased as a result of channel mix due to higher sales in our e-commerce channel, less promotional activity, and favorable product mix. This was further supplemented by lower AUC as a result of product mix, partially offset by channel mix and higher distribution center costs from the expansion of our U.S. distribution center. Gross profit also increased $43.6 million, or 12.2%, due to sales volume. Foreign currency translation decreased gross profit by $2.2 million, or 0.6%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, SG&A for our Americas segment increased by $17.0 million, or 11.3%, compared to 2019. This was primarily due to an increase in marketing costs of $10.2 million due to higher variable marketing associated with a higher share of e-commerce sales, $8.3 million of inventory donations associated with COVID-19, and an increase in other net costs of $3.5 million, in part due to bad debt expense recognized related to the impact of COVID-19 on our distributors. These increases were offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in compensation expense, primarily due to the temporary closure of, and reduction of store hours at, our retail stores during the year and the permanent elimination of certain roles in response to COVID-19.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

An increase in e-commerce revenues partially offset these declines. Foreign currency fluctuations, primarily in the Korean Won, also decreased revenue slightly. Increased ASP, due to channel mix, fewer promotions, less discounting, and increased sales of charms per shoe, partially offset these declines. ----- Income from Operations._** During the year ended December 31, 2020, income from operations for our Asia Pacific segment was $47.4 million, a decrease of $33.2 million, or 41.2%. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $36.0 million, or 19.4%, while gross margin increased 40 basis points to 53.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross profit was largely due to lower volume of $34.1 million, or 18.4%, particularly in our wholesale channel, as a result of the lack of tourism in our distributors’ markets and temporary closures of our wholesale partners’ B&M stores during the pandemic. Foreign currency fluctuations also decreased gross profit by $1.5 million or 0.8%. Finally, higher ASP, net of AUC, of $2.0 million, due to the shift in direct-to-consumer revenues, was offset by a pandemicrelated inventory write-off of $2.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $2.8 million, or 2.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. This was due in part to reductions in compensation expense of $3.2 million due to the temporary and permanent elimination of certain roles in response to COVID-19, facilities expense of $3.2 million as a result of store closures in Australia and Hong Kong and COVID-19 related rent abatements, primarily in Singapore, and travel and related costs of $2.0 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in SG&A from donations of inventory to frontline healthcare workers and other organizations of $1.4 million, higher bad debt expense of $1.2 million, in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on distributor partners, an increase in marketing costs of $1.2 million due to variable marketing associated with a higher share of e-commerce sales, and higher other net costs of $1.8 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

E-commerce volume increases of 33.4% were more than offset by retail volume decreases of 36.4% and wholesale volume decreases of 2.7%, as consumers shifted to online shopping during the pandemic. Negative foreign currency fluctuations in the Russian Ruble, partially offset by positive fluctuations in the Euro, also reduced revenues.

The decrease in our EMEA segment gross profit was due to lower volumes of $3.6 million, or 3.0%, primarily in our retail channel, and negative foreign currency fluctuations of $1.3 million, or 1.1%. Higher AUC in our wholesale channel due to increased distribution costs at our EMEA distribution center was mostly offset by higher ASP in our e-commerce channel as a result of fewer promotions and discounts and price increases, for a total decrease to gross profit of $0.4 million or 0.3%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, SG&A for our EMEA segment increased $1.7 million, or 3.3%, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to increased marketing cost of $2.5 million as a result of higher variable marketing associated with a higher share of e-commerce sales and increased other net costs of $0.7 million, offset by a reduction in compensation expense of $1.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

This increase was primarily due to a $20.0 million impairment to the right-of-use asset and store assets for a retail location in New York City, a $1.1 million impairment to the right-of-use asset for our former corporate headquarters, higher compensation expense of $13.2 million due to higher variable compensation and sales commissions associated with higher revenues, and an increase in facilities expense of $3.0 million due to duplicate rent costs associated with our new corporate headquarters and higher insurance premiums.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on (A) a domestic base rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Federal Funds open rate, plus 0.25%, (ii) the Prime Rate, and (iii) the Daily LIBOR rate, plus 1.00%), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.875% based on our leverage ratio, or (B) a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.875% based on our leverage ratio. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) 3.50 to 1.00 from the quarter ended December 31, 2020 to the quarter ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) 3.25 to 1.00 from the quarter ending March 31, 2022 and thereafter (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The Credit Agreement permits (i) stock repurchases subject to certain restrictions, including after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed certain levels; and (ii) certain acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility were $500.0 million. At December 31, 2020, we had $180.0 million in outstanding borrowings, which are due when the Revolving Credit Facility matures in July 2024, and $0.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility.

We also entered into two revolving credit facility agreements in Asia during 2020, which are discussed in more detail under “Asia Revolving Credit Facilities” below. Throughout the year, we took several defensive measures to maximize liquidity in response to COVID-19, including reducing expenses, primarily through the temporary and permanent elimination of certain corporate and regional roles, extending payment terms with vendors, managing inventory levels by constraining incoming supply and focusing on core product, deferring discretionary capital expenditures, and suspending our share repurchase and foreign currency exchange derivative programs for a portion of the year. We began to reinvest in the business in the second half of the year and resumed both our share repurchase and foreign currency exchange derivative programs. We plan to continue to closely monitor our costs and adjust as needed in response to changes in the market. As of December 31, 2020, we have largely returned to standard payment terms with our vendors and customers after encountering term extension requests from some customers, recognizing bad debt expense of $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with global distributors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and more strictly managing accounts payable in the first part of the year.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on historical experience, complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We believe that the following discussion represents those accounting policies that are the most critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Our estimates are based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, economic trends and conditions affecting our customer base, significant non-recurring events, and historical write-off experience. Specific provisions are recorded for individual receivables when we become aware of a customer’s inability or unwillingness to meet its financial obligations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and we may experience changes in the amount of reserves we recognize for accounts receivable that we deem uncollectible. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge, respectively, to ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which we made such a determination. Additionally, a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenues and net income involves estimating reserves for sales returns, allowances, discounts, and rebates, which represent the portion of revenues not expected to be realized. Wholesale revenues are reduced by estimates of returns, allowances, discounts, contractual discounts to major customers, and rebates. We also may accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments, and may provide markdown allowances at our sole discretion to key wholesalers and distributors to facilitate sales of slower moving products. Further, we record reductions to revenues for estimated customer credits as a result of price markdowns in certain markets. Revenues in our retail and e-commerce channels are also reduced by an estimate of returns. Our estimated sales returns and allowances are based on customer return history and actual outstanding returns yet to be received. Changes to our estimates for customer returns, allowances, discounts, and rebates may be caused by many factors, including, but not limited to whether customers accept our new styles, customer inventory levels, shipping delays or errors, known or suspected product defects, the seasonal nature of our products, and macroeconomic factors affecting our customers. Historically, actual amounts of customer returns, allowances, discounts, and rebates have not differed significantly from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, allowances, discounts, and rebates as of December 31, 2020 would have an immaterial impact on our 2020 revenues. See Schedule II in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for an analysis of the activity in our reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, sales returns, allowances, and discounts. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,180
1053_1,Offerings 2021.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.22,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,15.22.3,Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,"Property and equipment along with other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Testing of long-lived assets for impairment is at the level of an asset group, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In our retail business, the asset group for impairment testing is each individual retail store. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including the remaining useful life of each asset group, forecasted growth rates, pricing, working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash needs specific to the asset group. Additional considerations when assessing impairment include changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions, global and regional economic conditions, demand for our product and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long-lived assets. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. In 2020, we recorded non-cash impairments of $20.0 million to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values for a retail store in New York City and $1.1 million for our former corporate headquarters. During 2019, we did not record any impairment charges. During 2018, we recorded non-cash impairment of $2.2 million to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values, including $1.3 million to reduce the carrying values of certain supply chain assets related to the closure of our Mexico and Italy manufacturing and distribution facilities and $0.9 million related to underperforming company-operated retail stores.

1053_1,Offerings 2021.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.22,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,15.22.4,Income Taxes,"As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded provisional estimates in accordance with GAAP, during 2017 in relation to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and the additional tax expense associated with the deemed repatriation tax. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded measurement period adjustments related to the provisional estimates. We have not changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion, and we have elected to account for the impact of global intangible low tax income (“GILTI”) based on the period cost method. While we consider our accounting for the Tax Act to be complete, we continue to evaluate new guidance and legislation as it is issued. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights primarily to align with current and future international operations. This transaction was executed using transfer pricing guidelines issued by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant estimates and assumptions were required to compute the valuation of this transaction. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future revenue growth and discount rates, which by their nature are inherently uncertain therefore may ultimately differ materially from our actual results. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential differences involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. While our tax position is not uncertain, because of the significant estimates used in the value of certain intellectual property rights, our tax reserves contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between ----- the carrying amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities. We provide for income taxes at the current and future enacted tax rates and laws applicable in each taxing jurisdiction. We account for the tax effects of GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises, to the extent applicable. We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. While the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the ‘Income tax expense (benefit)’ line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. We determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020, which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. See Note 13—Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for further information related to income taxes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

In 2020, construction began on a new EMEA distribution center in the Netherlands, which is expected to be fully operational in 2021, and we completed the relocation of our third-party operated Asia Pacific distribution center within Japan.

We own or license the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of all of our products, both domestically and internationally, in most countries where our products are currently either sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Crocs logo and the Crocs word mark, both of which are registered or pending registration in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Canada, among other countries. We also have registrations or pending trademark applications for other marks and logos in various countries around the world. In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. Our trademarks registered within and outside of the U.S. are generally valid as long as they are ----- in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. We believe our trademarks and patents are crucial to the successful marketing and sale of our products. We strategically register, both domestically and internationally, the trademarks and patents covering certain product designs and branding that we utilize today. We aggressively police our patents, trademarks, and copyrights and pursue those who infringe upon them, both domestically and internationally, as we deem necessary. We consider the formulations of the materials used to produce our footwear covered by our trademark Croslite™and LiteRide™, among others, valuable trade secrets. The material formulations are manufactured through a process that combines a number of components in various proportions to achieve the properties for which our products are known. We use multiple suppliers to source these components but protect the formulations by using an exclusive supply agreement for key components, confidentiality agreements with our third-party processors, and by requiring our employees to execute confidentiality agreements concerning the protection of our confidential information. Other than our third-party processors, we are unaware of any third party using our formulations in the production of footwear. We believe the comfort and utility of our products depend on the properties achieved from the compounding of the Croslite™and LiteRide™ materials, which constitutes a key competitive advantage for us, and we intend to continue to vigorously protect these trade secrets. We also actively combat counterfeiting and other infringements of our brand by monitoring the global marketplace. We use our employees, sales representatives, distributors, and retailers, as well as outside investigators, attorneys, and customs agents, to police against infringing products by encouraging them to notify us of any suspect products and to assist law enforcement agencies. Our sales representatives and distributors are also educated on our patents, pending patents, trademarks, and trade dress to assist in preventing potentially infringing products from obtaining retail shelf space. The laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, we may have difficulty obtaining legal protection for our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer shall send or cause to be sent by first-class mail (or electronic transmission in the case of notes held in book-entry form), with a copy to the trustee, to each holder of notes, at such holder’s address appearing in the security register, a notice stating: (1) that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant described herein under “—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event” and that all notes timely tendered will be accepted for repurchase; ----- (2) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the purchase date, which shall be, subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered; and (3) the procedures that holders of notes must follow in order to tender their notes (or portions thereof) for payment, and the procedures that holders of notes must follow in order to withdraw an election to tender notes (or portions thereof) for payment. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the indenture to redeem all of the notes, as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described above, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under this covenant by virtue of such compliance. The Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers in connection with this offering. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event, although it is possible that the Issuer would decide to do so in the future. Subject to the covenants described below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all”of our assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, if the Issuer disposes of less than all of its assets by any of the means described above, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its notes may be uncertain. The Credit Agreement restricts us in certain circumstances from purchasing any notes prior to maturity of the notes and also provides that the occurrence of some of the events that would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Credit Agreement. Other Debt of the Issuer may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require that other Debt be repurchased upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Our failure to purchase notes in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event would result in a default under the indenture. Any such default would, in turn, constitute a default under the Credit Agreement, and may constitute a default under any of our other Debt as well. Our obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified at any time prior to the occurrence of that Change of Control Triggering Event with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” The Issuer will promptly give the trustee written notice of any such suspension of covenants and in any event not later than five Business Days after such suspension has occurred.

On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt” (to the extent such Debt would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Debt Incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Debt would not be permitted to be Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt,” such Debt will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (j) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt.” For purposes of determining compliance with the ----- covenant described under “—Limitation on Asset Sales,” on the Reversion Date, the Net Available Cash from all Asset Sales not applied in accordance with the covenant will be deemed to be reset to zero.

For the purposes of this covenant: (1) securities or other assets received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the purchaser that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after the closing of such Asset Sale shall be considered to be cash to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; (2) any cash consideration paid to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary in connection with the Asset Sale that is held in escrow or on deposit to support indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations in respect of such Asset Sale shall be considered to be cash; (3) Productive Assets received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with the Asset Sale shall be considered to be cash; (4) the requirement that at least 75% of the consideration paid to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary in connection with the Asset Sale be in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents or assumed liabilities shall also be considered satisfied if the cash or Cash Equivalents received constitutes at least 75% of the consideration received by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Asset Sale, determined on an after-tax basis; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with the Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received in respect of Asset Sales, that at that time outstanding does not exceed the greater of (x) $50.0 million or (y) 5.00% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets shall be considered to be cash.

The holders of a majority of the principal amount of the notes may also remove the trustee under the indenture at any time. The Trustee may resign.

You can find the definitions of capitalized terms used in this description and not defined elsewhere under the subheading “Certain Definitions” below or elsewhere in this “Description of Notes.” The Issuer will issue the % senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) under an indenture, to be dated as of, 2021, among the Issuer, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (as such indenture may be supplemented and amended from time to time, the “indenture.”) The following summary of certain provisions of the indenture and the notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the provisions of the indenture and the notes including the definitions of certain terms therein. The indenture will not be qualified under, and is not required to be, nor is subject to, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). Consequently, holders of the notes generally will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act of holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It does not restate the indenture in its entirety. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We urge you to read the indenture in its entirety because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of a note. Copies of the indenture are available without charge upon request to the Issuer at the address indicated under “Information Incorporated by Reference.” A registered holder of a note (each, a “holder”) will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes under the indenture.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them from time to time. We and the Trustee take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Depository Trust Company has advised us that The Depository Trust Company is a limitedpurpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the ----- “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to The Depository Trust Company’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of The Depository Trust Company only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of The Depository Trust Company are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. The Depository Trust Company has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, The Depository Trust Company will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of such interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by The Depository Trust Company (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through The Depository Trust Company. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in The Depository Trust Company system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of The Depository Trust Company. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because The Depository Trust Company can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in The Depository Trust Company system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company or its nominee will be payable to The Depository Trust Company in its capacity as the registered holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee (and each of our respective agents) will treat the persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes whatsoever. Consequently, neither we, the Trustee nor any of our or the Trustee’s agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for (i) any aspect of The Depository Trust Company’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of The Depository Trust Company’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or (ii) any other matter relating to the actions and ----- practices of The Depository Trust Company or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. The Depository Trust Company has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date, in amounts proportionate to their respective holdings in the principal amount of beneficial interest in the relevant security as shown on the records of The Depository Trust Company unless The Depository Trust Company has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of the Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of The Depository Trust Company, the Trustee or us or any of our respective agents. Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our respective agents will be liable for any delay by The Depository Trust Company or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Notes, and we and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from The Depository Trust Company or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under the section of this offering memorandum entitled “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in The Depository Trust Company will be effected in accordance with The Depository Trust Company’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through The Depository Trust Company in accordance with The Depository Trust Company’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in The Depository Trust Company, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to The Depository Trust Company. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. The Depository Trust Company has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account The Depository Trust Company has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, The Depository Trust Company reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Notes to its Participants. Although The Depository Trust Company, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in The Depository Trust Company, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. None of us, the Guarantors, the Trustee and any of our or their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by The Depository Trust Company, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its U.S. Depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving Notes through The Depository Trust Company, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to The Depository Trust Company. Clearstream Participants and Euroclear Participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. Depositaries. Because of time-zone differences, credits of Notes received through Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a The Depository Trust Company participant will be made during subsequent Notes settlement processing and dated the business day following The Depository Trust Company settlement date.

Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers, and other institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition, because of timezone differences, U.S. investors who hold their interests in the Notes through these systems and wish to transfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests, on a particular day may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, as applicable.

Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to challenge successfully our determination and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders would be required, among other things, (a) to accrue ordinary interest income, regardless of their method of tax accounting, based on a projected payment schedule and comparable yield, which will be a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes, and (b) to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, all or a portion of any gain recognized on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a Note.

This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained by a court.

This discussion does not include any description of the tax laws of any state, local or foreign government that may be applicable to a particular U.S. holder or non-U.S. holder and, except as otherwise expressly noted, does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” and who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. For this purpose only, the issue price of the Notes will be the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, wholesalers or placement agents. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident alien of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. For purposes of the following discussion, a “Non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note (other than a partnership or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder. If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

For example, a Subject Plan is prohibited from lending money (or otherwise extending credit) to a party in interest or disqualified person, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, any fiduciary who authorizes such a transaction may be subject to personal liability, and any such transaction may need to be reversed or otherwise corrected. In addition, if the Subject Plan involved in a non-exempt prohibited transaction is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity (“IRA”), the IRA could lose its tax-exempt status. Because the Notes will be considered to be a loan from the Note purchasers or holders to us, the acquisition and/or holding of a Note by a Subject Plan with respect to which we are considered to be a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the Note is acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of a Note. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, relating to transactions effected by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, relating to investments by bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, relating to investments by life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23, relating to transactions directed by in-house asset managers, although there can be no assurance that the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. In addition to the foregoing, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 provides a statutory exemption (Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code) for transactions between a Subject Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person with respect to that Subject Plan (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that, directly or indirectly, has or exercises discretionary authority or control, or renders investment advice with respect to, the Subject Plan assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the Subject Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that, in connection with the transaction, the Covered Plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate consideration. ----- Governmental plans and church plans that are subject to Similar Law may purchase or hold a Note only in compliance with such Similar Law, including any applicable statutory or administrative prohibited transaction exemption available under such Similar Law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases. ----- - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. - Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase Notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

The initial purchasers and their affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In particular, U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., one of the initial purchasers, is an affiliate of the trustee under the indenture governing the Notes. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. For example, affiliates of some of the initial purchasers are lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility and our Citibank Facility. As a result, they will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering in connection with the repayment of our Revolving Credit Facility. See “Use of Proceeds.” If certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchases or their affiliates routinely hedge and certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, ----- these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby.

The Company takes a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. In December 2020, the Company completed a series of transactions resulting in changes to their international legal structure, including a transfer of certain intellectual property rights among wholly-owned subsidiaries to the Netherlands. The transfer resulted in a step-up in tax basis of intellectual property rights and a corresponding increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual property rights. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $492.5 million and related uncertain tax positions of $197.0 million. We identified management’s valuation of the deferred tax asset and related uncertain tax positions resulting from the Company’s transfer of certain intellectual property to its Netherlands subsidiary as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments and estimates that were required to be made by management to properly value the deferred tax asset and uncertain tax positions. The judgments and estimates were related to the Company’s interpretation of related tax laws and regulations, as well as the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events. As a result, we utilized a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions for the measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the forecasts of future revenue growth and the selection of the discount rate. We also utilized a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management’s judgments in interpreting and applying tax laws and estimates and assumptions regarding future settlement were appropriate in determining the value of the uncertain tax positions. _How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_ Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue growth and discount rate used by management to measure the deferred tax asset and the uncertain tax position included the following, among others: - We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the determination of the measurement of deferred tax asset, such as controls related to management’s selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenues, and management’s controls over the measurement of the uncertain tax position, such as controls related to the evaluation of subjective estimates in the amounts to be realized. - We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts by comparing to: – Historical revenue growth rates – Historical revenue growth rates of peer companies – Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors – Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports – Expected macroeconomic trends. - With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate by: – Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation ----- – Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management. - With the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated the measurement of uncertain tax positions. Our procedures included the following, among others: – Reviewed the Company’s analysis of the uncertain tax positions and evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions and calculations the Company used to develop the amount of the related uncertain tax positions – Obtained the Company’s supporting documentation to assess the technical tax merits applicable to Dutch and international transfer pricing standards, the more-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds and evaluated the application of these relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination – Evaluated the Company’s measurement of the liability using our knowledge of international, domestic, and local income tax laws, as well as settlement activity from the relevant income tax authorities. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Denver, Colorado February 23, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Leases with an original term of twelve months or less are not reported in the consolidated balance sheets; expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that, if exercised by us, may extend the lease term. The exercise of these renewal options is at our discretion. When assessing the likelihood ----- of a renewal or termination, we consider the significance of leasehold improvements, availability of alternative locations, and the cost of relocation or replacement, among other considerations. The depreciable lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the expected lease term. We determine the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and factor in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Due to our centralized treasury function, we utilize a portfolio approach to discount our lease obligations. We assess the expected lease term at lease inception and discount the lease using a fully-secured annual incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for time value corresponding with the expected lease term. Certain of our retail store leases include rental payments based upon a percentage of retail sales in excess of a minimum fixed rental. In some cases, there is no fixed minimum rental and the entire rental payment is based upon a percentage of sales. Certain of our warehouse leases have rental payments that vary based upon the volume of product placed in storage. In addition, certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for changes in price level indices. We recognize expense for these types of payments as incurred and report them as variable lease expense. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we received lease concessions from landlords in the form of rent deferrals and rent abatements in the year ended December 31, 2020. We chose to implement the policy election provided by the FASB in April 2020 to record rent concessions as if no modification to lease contracts were made, and thus no changes to the lease obligations were recorded in respect to these concessions. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding deferred rent of $0.4 million. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we received rent abatements of $1.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

RSAs and RSUs generally vest over three years, depending on the terms of the grant. Holders of unvested RSAs have the same rights as those of common stockholders including voting rights and non-forfeitable dividend rights. However, ownership of unvested RSAs cannot be transferred until vested. Holders of unvested RSUs have a contractual right to receive shares of common stock upon vesting. RSUs have dividend equivalent rights, which accrue over the term of the award and are paid if and when the RSUs vest, but RSU holders have no voting rights. We grant servicecondition RSUs, performance-condition RSUs, and, less frequently, market-condition RSUs. Service-condition RSUs are typically granted on an annual basis and vest over time in three equal annual installments, beginning one year after the grant date. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we granted 0.6 million, 0.3 million, and 0.4 million service-condition RSUs, respectively. Performance-condition RSUs are typically granted on an annual basis and consist of a performancebased and service-based component. The performance targets and vesting conditions for performancecondition RSUs are based on achievement of multiple weighted performance goals. The number of performance-condition RSUs ultimately awarded may be between 0% and 200%, based on performance. These RSUs vest in three equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date, pending certification of performance achievement by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors and continued service. The fair value of performance-condition awards is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. Compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is updated for our expected performance level against performance goals at the end of each reporting period. We also periodically grant market-condition RSUs to certain executives. The grant date fair value and derived service period for marketcondition RSUs are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we granted 0.5 million, 0.5 million, and 1.0 million performance- and market-condition RSUs, respectively. ----- RSA and RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2020 was:",N/A,as_expected,2021,180

Unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 relate to tax years that are currently open under the statute of limitation. The primary impact of uncertain tax benefits on the rate reconciliation includes audit settlements, net increases in position changes, and accrued interest expense. Any settlements or statute of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions using the best available information to management. However, our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and any variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible change related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant. ----- Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in ‘Income tax expense (benefit)’ in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded approximately $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, of penalties and interest. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we released $0.1 million of interest from settlements, lapse of statutes, and change in certainty. The cumulative accrued balance of penalties and interest was $1.2 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Unrecognized tax benefits of $205.6 million, $4.0 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate offset by deferred tax assets recorded for uncertain tax positions.

As such, U.S. state income tax returns for us are generally subject to examination for the years 2015 to 2020.

The change in the valuation allowance includes $143.0 million related to income tax benefit and $4.6 million that does not impact the tax provision because this amount reflects the cumulative impact of unrecorded tax attributes related to changes in cumulative translation adjustments. During 2019, valuation allowances decreased by $34.2 million. The change in the valuation allowance includes $33.7 million related to income tax expense and $0.5 million that does not impact the tax provision because this amount reflects the impact of unrecorded tax attributes related to changes in cumulative translation adjustments. Our valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of tax attributes recorded in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In assessing our valuation allowance we considered all available evidence, including the magnitude of recent and current operating results, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our historical experience utilizing tax attributes prior to their expiration dates, the historical volatility of operating results of these jurisdictions, and our assessment regarding the sustainability of their profitability. The weight we give to ----- any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. Certain jurisdictions, for which we have historically recorded significant valuation allowances, have sufficient history of sustained profitability as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, not associated with the intra-entity intellectual property rights transfer, decreased by $20.2 million. In certain other jurisdictions, we recorded additional attributes, primarily driven by operational losses recognized based on local tax accounting requirements. These carryforwards were generated in jurisdictions where results indicate it is not more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized. We maintain a valuation allowance against the majority of these balances. We have included in the table above deferred tax assets related to U.S. federal tax carryforwards, including foreign tax credits and other tax credits, which expire at various dates between 2026 and 2040 of $5.8 million and $39.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have included in the table above deferred tax assets related to U.S. state tax net operating loss carryforwards, some of which expire at various dates beginning in 2022 and some of which do not expire, of $3.6 million and $6.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have recorded deferred tax assets related to foreign tax carryforwards, including foreign tax credits and net operating losses, which expire starting in 2021 and those which do not expire of $58.4 million and $48.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of the foreign carryforwards and other attributes. The transition tax in the Tax Act imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings at various tax rates. This tax largely eliminated the differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of foreign undistributed earnings. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2020, foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. as these amounts are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

We have not changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion, and we have elected to account for the impact of global intangible low tax income based on the period cost method. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights primarily to align with current and future international operations. This transaction was executed using transfer pricing guidelines issued by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant estimates and assumptions were required to compute the valuation of this transaction. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future revenue growth and discount rates, which by their nature are inherently uncertain therefore may ultimately differ materially from our actual results. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential differences involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. While our tax position is not uncertain, because of the significant estimates used in the value of certain intellectual property rights, our tax reserves contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and ----- regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated. The transfer resulted in a step-up in tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual property rights. We recorded a deferred tax asset of $492.5 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $197.0 million, and further reduced by a valuation allowance of $167.8 million. Based on available objective evidence, management believes that $167.8 million of the deferred tax asset, to the extent not offset by reserves for uncertain tax positions, is not more-likely-than-not to be realizable as of December 31, 2020 and, therefore, is offset by a valuation allowance. As such, a net deferred tax asset of $127.7 million was recognized along with a corresponding foreign deferred income tax benefit.

Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. Revenues for ‘Other businesses’ include non-footwear and accessories product sales to external customers that are excluded from the measurement of segment operating revenues and income. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of other businesses and unallocated corporate expenses, as well as inter-segment eliminations.

On January 13, 2015, we were notified about the issuance of assessments totaling 14.4 million Brazilian Real (“BRL”), or approximately $2.8 million at current exchange rates, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. We disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, we received additional assessments totaling 33.3 million BRL, or approximately $6.4 million at current exchange rates, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. We also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, we received a favorable ruling on our appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and we have challenged the appeal on both the merits and procedure. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable for us and resulted in an approximately 38% reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately $4.0 million, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and Crocs has filed a response to the tax authorities’ appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, we may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. We have not recorded these items within the consolidated financial statements as it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of this matter or to estimate a potential amount of loss, if any. For all other claims and disputes, we have accrued estimated losses of $0.1 million within ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As we are able, we estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses for claims and other disputes. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that reasonably possible losses could potentially exceed amounts accrued by up to $0.9 million. Although we are subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, other than as set forth above, we are not party to any other pending legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably have a material adverse impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,180
