 Confirmation of your representation: In order to be eligible to view the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum or make an investment decision with respect to the Notes, you must be outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. You have been sent the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum on the basis that you have confirmed to the initial purchasers set forth in the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum (the ‘‘Initial Purchasers’’), being the sender or senders of the attached, that either: (1) the e-mail address to which the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum has been delivered is not located in the United States, its territories and possessions, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia; ‘‘possessions’’ include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island and the Northern Mariana Islands; or (2) if you are a resident in a member state of the EEA, you are not a ‘‘retail investor’’. For the purposes of clause (2) of the preceding sentence, the expression ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (x) a ‘‘retail client’’ as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); or (y) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (the ‘‘Insurance Mediation Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

 The attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic format. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of transmission and, consequently, none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer or any of their subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, employee or agent thereof, or affiliate of any such person, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

###### consent of the Issuer. If you receive this document by e-mail, you should not reply by e-mail to this announcement. Any reply e-mail communications, including those you generate by using the ‘‘Reply’’ function on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive this document by e-mail, your use of this e-mail is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that it is free from viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

 The materials relating to the Offering (as defined in the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum) do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

 Restrictions: The attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum is being furnished in connection with an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. Nothing in this electronic transmission constitutes an offer of securities for sale in the United States.

 Any securities to be issued will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

 Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led the manufacturers to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however and without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

 The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Insurance Mediation Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

 The attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, persons who (i) are outside the United Kingdom, (ii) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’), (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Financial Promotion Order, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as the ‘‘relevant persons’’). The attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on the attached Preliminary Offering Memorandum or any of its contents.

 This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared and is not being distributed in the context of a public offering of financial securities in France within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Code mon´etaire et financier and Title I of Book II of the R`eglement G´en´eral of the Autorit´e des march´es financiers (the French financial markets authority) (the ‘‘AMF’’). Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the public in France (‘‘offre au public de titres financiers’’), and neither this Preliminary Offering Memorandum, nor any offering or marketing materials relating to the Notes must be made available or distributed in any way that would constitute, directly or indirectly, an offer to the public in France.

 The Notes may only be offered or sold in France to qualified investors (‘‘investisseurs qualifi´es’’) acting for their own account and/or to providers of investment services relating to portfolio management for the

PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION
CONFIDENTIAL IN THE UNITED STATES

20SEP201810311157


#### Getlink SE
###### E500,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2023


Getlink SE (formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE), a European company regulated by French law with a Board of Directors,
incorporated in Paris, France and governed by the relevant provisions of prevailing French and EU laws and regulations (the
‘‘Issuer’’), is offering (the ‘‘Offering’’) A500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the
‘‘Notes’’). Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each 30 June and 30 December commencing on
30 December 2018. The Notes will mature on 2023.
The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after 2020, in each case, at the redemption prices set
out in this Preliminary Offering Memorandum (the ‘‘Offering Memorandum’’). Prior to 2020, the Issuer will be entitled to
redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date, plus a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium, as described in
this Offering Memorandum. Prior to 2020, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, also redeem up to
40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings. Additionally, the
Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events
constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to repurchase all or any portion of the Notes at 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of such repurchase. See ‘‘Description of
_Notes—Optional Redemption’’._
The Notes are senior obligations of the Issuer and will be secured by share pledges over two of the Issuer’s direct subsidiaries and a
first ranking charge on the Debt Service Reserve Account (as defined herein), which together will constitute the Security (as defined
herein). The Notes will rank _pari passu in right of payment with any of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not expressly_
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future debt of the Issuer
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment thereto. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s existing
and future debt that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and
assets securing such debt. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt of subsidiaries of the Issuer. The
Security that secures the Notes may secure certain hedging obligations and certain other future debt (the ‘‘Senior Obligations’’) on a
_pari passu basis. The Security may be released in certain circumstances._
This Offering Memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, security,
covenants and transfer restrictions.
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange plc trading as Euronext
Dublin (‘‘Euronext Dublin’’) for the approval of this document as Listing Particulars. Application has been made to Euronext Dublin
for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List and trading on the Global Exchange Market, which is the exchange regulated
market of Euronext Dublin. The Global Exchange Market is not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2019/65/EC, as
amended (the ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’). There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Global
Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin. Settlement of the Notes is not conditional on such listing or admission.
The Notes are expected upon issue to be rated by S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited (‘‘S&P’’) and by Fitch Ratings Limited
(‘‘Fitch’’), and, together with S&P, the ‘‘Rating Agencies’’). S&P and Fitch are established in the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’)
and registered under Regulation (EU) No 1060/2009, as amended. S&P and Fitch appear on the latest update of the list of
registered credit rating agencies on the ESMA website http://www.esma.europa.eu. A security rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

 THE NOTES MAY NOT BE OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC WITHIN ANY JURISDICTION. BY ACCEPTING DELIVERY OF THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM, YOU AGREE NOT TO OFFER, SELL, RESELL, TRANSFER OR DELIVER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY NOTES TO THE PUBLIC.

 NOTICE TO EEA INVESTORS

 The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the ‘‘Insurance Mediation Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

 Professional Investors and ECPs only target market. Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led the manufacturers to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

 France.

###### CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 Certain statements in this Offering Memorandum are not historical facts and are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements appear in various locations, including, without limitation, in the sections entitled ‘‘Summary’’, and ‘‘Risk Factors’’, along with sections of Annex A entitled ‘‘Presentation of the Group and its Businesses’’, ‘‘Results and Outlook’’ and ‘‘Risks and Controls’’ and the section of Annex B entitled ‘‘Half Year Activity Report’’. The Group may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements in reports to shareholders and in other communications. In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking information that has been extracted from third-party sources. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the Group’s plans, expectations, projections, objectives, targets, goals, strategies, future events, future operating revenues or performance, capital expenditures, return on capital invested, operating margins, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, the Group’s competitive strengths and weaknesses, the Group’s business strategy, and the trends the Group anticipates in the industries and the political and legal environments in which the Group operates and other information that is not historical information.

 Words such as ‘‘believe’’, ‘‘anticipate’’, ‘‘estimate’’, ‘‘target’’, ‘‘potential’’, ‘‘expect’’, ‘‘intend’’, ‘‘predict’’, ‘‘project’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘should’’, ‘‘may’’, ‘‘will’’, ‘‘plan’’, ‘‘aim’’, ‘‘seek’’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

 The forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum are largely based on the Group’s expectations, which reflect estimates and assumptions made by the Group’s management. These estimates and assumptions reflect the Group’s best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other factors, some of which are discussed below. In addition, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. The Group cautions all readers that the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum are not guarantees of future performance, and the Group cannot assure any reader that such statements will be realised or the forward-looking events and circumstances will occur.

 By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, many of which are beyond the Group’s control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among other things, those listed in the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’, as well as those included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. You should be aware that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors include those set out in section 3.1 of Annex A.

 These factors and the other factors discussed in the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and relevant sections of Annex A are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum (including Annexes A and B) describe additional factors that could adversely affect the Group’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Group to predict all such risks, nor can the Group assess the impact of all such risks on the Group’s business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

 Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this Offering Memorandum or, in respect of Annexes A and B, or the dates noted in the section entitled ‘‘Annexes and Documents Incorporated by Reference’’ above. Accordingly, the Group does not intend, and does not undertake any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements set forth in this Offering Memorandum or Annexes A and B. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Group or to persons acting on the Group’s behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum and/or Annexes A or B, as applicable. You should not place undue reliance on any forward- looking statements.

###### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA

 Issuer

 The Issuer is a European company regulated by French law, incorporated in Paris, France and is governed by the relevant provisions of prevailing French and EU laws and regulations. The Issuer has no material assets or liabilities other than its holdings in, and intercompany loans to, its subsidiaries and it has not engaged in any operating activities. The Issuer was incorporated on 6 July 2005.

 Financial information

 Financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been extracted from the Annual Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements of the Issuer, as applicable. The English language translation of (i) the Annual Financial Statements is included, or incorporated by reference into, Annex A to this Offering Memorandum; and (ii) the Interim Financial Statements is included in Annex B to this Offering Memorandum, in each case as set out in further detail in ‘‘Annexes and Documents Incorporated by Reference’’. The Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS and have been audited by the Issuer’s independent accountants, KPMG Audit a division of KPMG SA, and Mazars SA (the ‘‘Independent Accountants’’), as set forth in their audit reports. The Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (Interim Financial Reporting) (‘‘IAS 34’’) and have been reviewed by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in their review report.

 The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. For a description of the Issuer’s significant accounting policies, critical estimates, judgments and assumptions, see Note B of each set of Annual Financial Statements. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial information are disclosed in the notes to the Annual Financial Statements and financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

 This Offering Memorandum also includes certain financial information relating to the Group’s key performance indicators derived from the Annual Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements, as applicable.

 Non-IFRS financial measures

 In this Offering Memorandum, the Group has included certain non-IFRS financial measures, such as EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.

 None of these measures are an IFRS measure, nor should they be construed as an alternative to any IFRS measure such as revenue, gross profit, other income, net profit or cash flow from operating activities. The Group defines:

 • ‘‘EBITDA’’ as trading profit before depreciation charges; and

 • ‘‘Free Cash Flow’’ as net cash flow from operating activities less net cash flow from investing activities (excluding the initial investment in new activities and the acquisition of shareholdings in subsidiary undertakings) and net cash flow from financing activities relating to debt service plus interest received (on cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets).

 These measures are sometimes used by investors to evaluate the efficiency of a company’s operations and its ability to employ its earnings toward repayment of debt and working capital requirements. There are no generally accepted principles governing the calculation of these measures and the criteria upon which these measures are based can vary from company to company. These measures, by themselves, do not provide a sufficient basis to compare the Group’s performance with that of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating profit or any other measure as an indicator of operating performance, or as an alternative to cash generated from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

 The Issuer presents in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information on an as adjusted basis to reflect the impact of the Transactions. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Financial and Other Information’’ and ‘‘Capitalisation’’. For a description of the estimated application of the proceeds of the Transactions; see ‘‘Use Of Proceeds’’. The unaudited as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the Group’s actual results would have been had

 xiii


-----

###### the Transactions occurred on such dates nor do they purport to project the Group’s financial position or finance costs or other as adjusted financial ratios at any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments, nor the resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

 The as adjusted financial information assumes that the principal amount of the Notes offered hereby is A500.0 million. To the extent the principal amount of the Notes changes, the as adjusted financial information will correspondingly change.

 Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented for the twelve months ended 30 June 2018. Such financial information has been computed by adding the number for the six months ended 30 June 2018 to the number for the year ended 31 December 2017 and subtracting from the resulting total the number for the six months ended 30 June 2017, in each case, in the relevant line item. These numbers are provided for convenience only and are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. The accounting basis used to prepare this information is not consistent before and after 1 January 2018, due to the first application of the new IFRS 9—Financial Instruments as at 1 January 2018, as disclosed in Note B.3.1 to the Interim Financial Statements.

 PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

 1.1 PROFILE

 1.1.1 DEVELOPMENT

 Initially the promoter of the Channel Tunnel, which is a historic and technological feat, the Group has transformed itself to provide solutions to increasing demands for mobility.

 In 23 years, the Tunnel has fundamentally changed commercial exchanges between the United Kingdom and continental Europe by enabling the development of new integrated cross-border logistics chains, as well as access to new markets. Approximately 30% of British exports to the European Union (approximately A54.8 billion) and 22% of imports from the European Union (approximately A60 billion) depended on the rapidity and the reliability of the Tunnel. Exports transiting through the Tunnel alone help to support 220,000 jobs in the United Kingdom. (Source: Ernst & Young LLP: Economic footprint of the Channel Tunnel fixed link: An analysis of the economic value of trade and passenger traffic travelling through the Channel Tunnel, October 2016).

 The Tunnel allows, every year, more than 20 million passengers to cross the Channel aboard Le Shuttle Passenger Shuttles and Eurostar passenger trains. The economic footprint generated by the tourists that travel through the Tunnel is estimated at A2.1 billion per year, contributing to 45,000 additional jobs in the United Kingdom.

 The Group was created in 1986 with the signing of the Concession Agreement, which granted the Franco British consortium of France Manche SA and The Channel Tunnel Group Limited the construction, financing and operation of the Channel Tunnel. The operation of the Tunnel started in 1994. In 2007 a new holding company, Groupe Eurotunnel SA (‘‘GET SA’’), was set up that proposed to all shareholders of the former Eurotunnel structure, to exchange their twinned shares for ordinary shares of Groupe Eurotunnel SA. This offer was accepted by more than 93% of shareholders. In late 2007, Eurotunnel PLC and Eurotunnel SA became TNU PLC and TNU SA and were absorbed by Groupe Eurotunnel SA (which has since become Groupe Eurotunnel SE) in May 2009 and October 2010 respectively.

 On 20 November 2017, the Group was rebranded ‘‘Getlink’’ and on 18 April 2018, Groupe Eurotunnel SE became Getlink SE. This new ‘‘Getlink’’ name, which evokes the dynamism of exchanges and links, marks the Group’s entry into a new era of mobility infrastructures. Much more than merely a new page in its history, this new name is a true commitment to the future with the development and management of safe, modern and environmentally-friendly mobility infrastructures. All of the Group’s businesses build and strengthen each day the promise made by this new identity to all of its customers: Safe, Smart & Green:

 • Safe: since its creation, the Group has chosen never to compromise on security and is still the safest way to cross the Channel and transport goods;

 • Smart: digital investment over more than five years has brought the Group into the era of smart infrastructure and enables it to offer customers an experience that is being constantly enriched, whether in terms of service quality, information accuracy or the reactiveness of its teams; and

 • Green: the Group operates some of the most environmentally-friendly mobility solutions and infrastructures and the Group is currently a leader in eco-responsible transport, contributing fully to energy transition.

 With this new ‘‘Getlink’’ name, the Group confirms its commitment to energy transition, its next generation public service mission and a new connected business model, that is more innovative and collaborative.

###### 1.1.2 THE GROUP’S STRUCTURE

 The Issuer is a European company regulated by French law with a Board of Directors, incorporated in Paris, France and is governed by the relevant provisions of prevailing French and EU laws and regulations.

 The legal structure of the Issuer was incorporated on 6 July 2005 for a fixed period of 99 years from the date of its registration in the Paris Trade and Companies Registry, i.e. until 3 August 2104. The Issuer was converted on 26 December 2014 to a European company and its name changed to Groupe Eurotunnel SE.

 The ordinary shares issued by the Issuer are listed on Euronext Paris and with the UK Listing Authority in London (standard listing) and are traded on Euronext Paris and Euronext London.

 The Issuer’s role with regards to its subsidiaries is set out in the introduction to the notes to the 2017 Annual Financial Statements in section 2.2.1 of Annex A.

 Under the umbrella of the Issuer, the Group operates the following commercial brands:

 • Eurotunnel, leader in cross-Channel exchanges (‘‘Eurotunnel Le Shuttle’’ and ‘‘Eurotunnel Le Shuttle Freight’’);

 • Europorte, leading private rail freight operator in France;

 • ElecLink, the future electrical interconnector between the United Kingdom and France; and

 • CIFFCO, the first private training centre dedicated to rail industry professions.

 As at 31 December 2017, the Issuer had a total of 54 subsidiaries, including 21 located in France and 30 located in the United Kingdom.

 In 2017, the Group was organised around the following three business sectors:

 • the cross-Channel fixed link Concession segment known as (the ‘‘Fixed Link’’);

 • the Europorte rail freight segment; and

 • the ElecLink segment.

 The Fixed Link segment

 France Manche SA (‘‘FM’’) and The Channel Tunnel Group Limited (‘‘CTG’’) operate the Tunnel as Concessionaires in accordance with the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement as described in chapter 8 of Annex A. FM and CTG, whose shares are twinned, are the borrowing entities under the Term Loan.

 Eurotunnel Services GIE (‘‘ESGIE’’) and Eurotunnel Services Limited (‘‘ESL’’) employ and manage the Group’s personnel mainly for the activities of the Concession. Relations between the employing companies of the Group and the Group’s subsidiaries are described in section 6.2 of Annex A.

 Centre International de Formation Ferroviaire de la Cˆote d’Opale (‘‘CIFFCO’’) supplies professional training services in the rail sector as described in section 6.2 of Annex A.

 Eurotunnel SE heads the distribution business in continental Europe (excluding France) of the Truck Shuttle Service activity.

 Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited (‘‘EASL’’) holds bonds purchased on the market by the Group. It held certain CLEF’s floating rate notes until their redemption in June 2017, as described in note G.1.1.a to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in section 2.2.1 of Annex A and holds certain CLEF’s G2 Bonds as mentioned in note A.1.2 to 2017 Annual Financial Statements contained in section 2.2.1 of Annex A.

 The Europorte rail freight segment

 The holding company Europorte SAS groups together all the rail freight transport subsidiaries (the ‘‘Europorte segment’’) providing a wide range of integrated rail freight services, including national and international haulage, local services for secondary lines, and services to industry (individual junction management, infrastructure maintenance, and wagon loading and unloading).

 2


-----

###### The ElecLink segment

 ElecLink Limited’s corporate purpose is the construction and operation of a 1,000 MW electricity interconnector between the UK and France. Preliminary work began towards the end of 2016 and the interconnector is scheduled to be brought into service at the beginning of 2020. GET Elec Limited, a subsidiary of the Issuer, holds the entire share capital of ElecLink Limited.

 Internal legal reorganisation of the Group

 In order to pursue its development and ensure its capacity to create value in the long term, the Group evolved its legal structure so that its main activity, namely the operation of the Fixed Link, is now in a different sub-group to the other sectors in the Group; they are managed and financed separately from the Fixed Link activity.

 This internal reorganisation enabled the Issuer to be released from its commitments as guarantor under the Term Loan described in section 8.1.4 of Annex A. It also enabled a more flexible funding structure to be put in place that is more suitable for the Group’s development needs.

 This evolution is set against the background of the long-term strategy begun by the Group with the aim of developing its core businesses, namely transport infrastructure and operations. It follows the operations begun in December 2015 with the withdrawal of two monolines, followed in 2017 by the refinancing of the variable rate debt, which enabled interest payments to be reduced by A50 million a year and the average cost of the debt to drop below 4%, and then on 7 February 2018 by the conclusion of an agreement to buy the G2 Bonds back from FMS Wermanagement AoR (‘‘FMS’’) with the possibility of acquiring before 2025 all or part of the G1 and/or G3 bonds held by FMS.

 The objective was to put a more flexible financing structure in place that would allow the Group to develop and deepen its strategy along the same lines as the ElecLink project.

 The reorganisation involved transferring the companies in the Fixed Link group to Eurotunnel Holding SAS, which became the new holding company for the Eurotunnel sub-group and the holder of the debt obligations of the Term Loan.

 1.1.3 GROUP STRATEGY

 Since its creation, the Group has continually evolved and since 2010 has enjoyed a period of quite remarkable growth as it has constantly sought to grow and create value, guided by an entrepreneurial spirit.

 As indicated in an EY study of October 2016, ‘‘The Channel Tunnel is an essential part of the UK’s transport infrastructure that has revolutionised the country’s physical accessibility to continental European markets. Since its opening in 1994, the Channel Tunnel has seen 300 million tonnes of goods, more than 23 million trucks, and 38 million tonnes of rail freight. The opening of the Tunnel has had far reaching economic consequences, enabling the development of new and varied business models. It has enabled the development of integrated cross-border supply chains in sectors such as manufacturing and retail, driving gains in productivity, and delivering clear and direct benefits to the UK economy. It has also helped to facilitate online purchasing, as express delivery companies ship goods to UK consumers via European hubs. The Tunnel has revolutionised business travel, with Eurostar services providing a fast and reliable service to Paris, Brussels and beyond. This has supported businesses in maintaining relationships with overseas customers whilst reducing travel time and cost. The opening of the first completed section of High Speed 1 in 2003, and its completion to St Pancras International in 2007, resulted in considerable reductions in journey times and, for a number of destinations, Eurostar is now faster than air travel’’.

 Recent history and context

 Attractiveness of a unique infrastructure

 The Group has seen outstanding growth in its Shuttle Services since 2010. During that time yields have also increased, thereby demonstrating the attractiveness of the transport system and the dynamism of the pricing structure.

 The high-speed railway business has also enjoyed sustained growth, with a resulting increase in revenue since the toll is based on passenger numbers with inflation contributing to revenue growth to a certain extent.

 3


-----

###### At an industrial level, the Group has been able to absorb this growth while maintaining the high quality of service that has under-pinned its success for nearly 25 years.

 This period of renewal was also accompanied by the diversification of the Group’s activities beyond the Concession:

 • in rail freight with Europorte in France, and GBRf in the United Kingdom, which was sold in 2016 with a return on investment in excess of 28%; and

 • with ElecLink, the electrical interconnector project between France and the United Kingdom; the Group acquired full control of this project in 2016 and work is now well under way.

 A strategic plan for the 21[st] century

 A mobility player of its time

 The Group and the Concession are at the very heart of the changes facing passenger and goods transport this century, with two key challenges emerging: energy transition and the digitalisation of the economy and the customer relationship. The Group is determined to transform these challenges into opportunities.

 The Tunnel: a unique and essential mobility player, ready to meet the mobility challenges of tomorrow

 In this context, the Group has drawn up a strategic plan based, for the Concession business, on two key pillars:

 • a dynamic pricing policy; and

 • constant improvements to the railway system, with service quality as the Group’s key focus. The Group will prioritise the fluidity and rapidity of its Short Straits’ crossings, which have been its trademark and the source of its success for nearly 25 years. This promise should take account of customer expectations and even anticipate them with digital solutions.

 The investment policy to accompany this plan must ensure both controlled and realistic growth in traffic while constantly improving service quality, essential to asserting and strengthening the Tunnel’s premium positioning.

 The company’s digital transformation is key to the plan’s success and will evidently require Group employees to be supported through the resulting profound changes in working practices and human relations. This support is an essential factor of the plan.

 Beyond this, the Group, like all long-term transport infrastructure players, is fully aware of the challenges raised by energy transition and the digital economy. The Group will take an active role in these changes that will transform the 21[st] century, participating in discussions on mobility in a low-carbon era and the rise of autonomous driving.

 Key role of transport infrastructure manager

 The Group plays a key role of a transport infrastructure manager for high-speed transport passengers. The Tunnel is ready to service new routes such as Amsterdam—London which began operating in April 2018, and is able to accommodate new services with annual passenger numbers potentially in excess of 15 million. Planned investment to improve track infrastructure will enable this level of growth to be absorbed without difficulty. As indicated in chapter 3 of Annex A, the High-Speed Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services travel through the Tunnel, but the Group does not operate these services and cannot exert direct influence on their commercial operation. High-Speed Passenger Train services are faced with barriers to development such as difficulties implementing efficient border controls and obtaining rolling stock authorisations (from the IGC and other authorities), which can delay, restrict or stop the development of services to new destinations. As indicated in section 1.2.2 of Annex A, the Group has developed various actions relating to the national authorities and the rail participants to bring these opportunities to fruition and pursues its long-term efforts to resolve the barriers to development of new services.

 ElecLink: a unique growth driver

 ElecLink, the 1,000 MW electrical interconnector between France and the United Kingdom currently being built by the Group, is a key component of the Group’s development strategy. ElecLink benefits from

 4


-----

###### a 25-year exemption from the application of EU regulations: ElecLink can forward sell capacity and has control over all of its assets and revenue. In addition, ElecLink will make a significant contribution to opening up the UK energy market and will benefit from the congestion income resulting from the imbalance in the electricity wholesale markets on either side of the Channel.

 Rail freight: a long-term commitment to a highly-promising sector

 The clean-up of the market and the long-delayed restructuring of Fret SNCF is under way. A new profitable business model for a virtuous economy is being implemented. Europorte, the first private rail operator in the market, is ideally positioned to become the rail freight benchmark in France.

 Debt management: optimizing costs and greater flexibility

 The Group’s existing debt was put in place during the 2007 financial restructuring. It included debt restriction and limitation clauses in order to guarantee the Group’s strength and stability, but which have the effect of limiting cost optimisation and financial flexibility options. The successful refinancing of part of the debt in June 2017 enabled financial costs to be optimised and the recognition by the markets of the Group’s financial solidity. The Group undertook a third step in its financial re-organisation when it concluded an agreement to purchase the G2 Bonds from FMS in order to make progress in the clarification of its structure and correspondingly the optimisation of its financing. The Transactions are an additional step in the Group’s debt management strategy.

 Robust outlook buoyed by collective goals

 The Group’s investment policy aims to support and amplify growth in its markets and focuses on investments that are complementary to existing asset positions. It aims to develop synergies within the Group and to leverage the specialist expertise of its teams in managing complex infrastructures, and particularly the Tunnel. Alongside operating the Concession, which will remain its core business, the Group aims to continue the controlled diversification of its revenues by operating Europorte, which is currently the only profitable rail freight business in France and completing the construction of the ElecLink electricity interconnector, which is already well under way. This project will be a significant driver of growth in Group revenues and margins from 2020. The Group may also perform focused acquisitions, alone or in partnership, such as in the transport infrastructure sector that may generate synergies with current businesses while strengthening the diversification of the Group’s business portfolio. That will also contribute to a reduction in its risk profile including the Group’s exposure to Brexit.

 Sustainable development

 In an environment marked by numerous geopolitical factors, the Group has demonstrated the relevance of its model. True to its entrepreneurial and responsible vision, the Group will continue to promote long-term value creation, while maintaining its commitment to sustainable, environmental and social development, inseparable from its long-term goals.

 1.2 CROSS-CHANNEL ACTIVITIES

 Under the terms of the Concession Agreement, the States have granted the Concessionaires the right and obligation to design, finance, construct and operate the Fixed Link between France and the United Kingdom, without prejudice to the sovereign role of the States in terms of control and border enforcement. The Concession Agreement, which is described in chapter 8 of Annex A to this Offering Memorandum, will expire in 2086.

 The Fixed Link comprises three tunnels of a length of about 50 kilometres each under the English Channel, as well as the two terminals at Folkestone in the United Kingdom and Coquelles in France, the fixed equipment and the related installations:

 • Two rail tunnels with a single track are, during normal service, each used by the trains moving in a single direction;

 • The third tunnel, located for most of its length between the two main rail tunnels, is a secure means for evacuation and is also used for Tunnel maintenance; and

 • Two cross over points between the rail tunnels allow trains to change between tunnels during maintenance work on certain sections of the tunnels.

 5


-----

###### The Fixed Link is directly connected to the British and French motorway networks, via the Folkestone and Coquelles terminals which are the departure and arrival points. Retail and food service areas are available to customers at each terminal. The Fixed Link is also connected to the national French and British rail networks and, more particularly, to the high-speed lines.

 The Fixed Link is an integrated transport system, including road shuttle services (for cars and trucks) and a rail service (passenger and freight trains). The Concessionaires, FM and CTG, operate the transport system with Shuttles and make paths available to companies that have a license allowing them to operate cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services.

 1.2.1 MAIN MARKETS

 The Fixed Link offers both a Shuttle Service between Calais and Folkestone for the transport of passengers, cars, coaches and trucks, and a Railway Network on which Railway Companies can run rail freight trains and High-Speed Passenger Trains. These services operate in the transport market between continental Europe and the United Kingdom.

 a) Freight market

 Freight traffic between continental Europe and the United Kingdom is commonly divided into four distinct modes:

 • Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied: trucks and trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea on Shuttles or ferries at the same time as the road tractor and driver, mostly via the Short Straits;

 • Roll-On/Roll-Off unaccompanied: trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea independently of the road tractor, mostly via North Sea routes;

 • rail freight: conventional or Intermodal trains running through the Tunnel; and

 • Lift-On/Lift-Off: moveable containers or swap bodies loaded on Lift-On/Lift-Off container ships, mostly on the North Sea routes.

 The market is based on three corridors:

 • the Short Straits: all routes from continental Europe to Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate (including the Tunnel);

 • the English Channel: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the south coast of the United Kingdom to the south west of Folkestone; and

 • the North Sea: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the east coast of the United Kingdom to the north of Ramsgate (including the Thames estuary).

 The modal distribution varies by geographic zone. For accompanied trucks, the long trip across the English Channel or the even longer trip across the North Sea makes these routes more suitable for Roll-On/ Roll-Off unaccompanied and Lift-On/ Lift-Off solutions.

 By contrast, the shorter crossing times of the Short Straits are more suitable to time-sensitive traffic, and attract most of the Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied traffic.

 Short Straits

 In the freight market, the Truck Shuttle Service is in competition with ferry operators in the accompanied road transport route across the Short Straits. Over the last 20 years, there has been a marked shift towards the use of accompanied trucks between continental Europe and the United Kingdom. The market share between the different routes is currently relatively stable. The Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied mode on the Short Straits routes still continues to grow because it provides the shortest and quickest route for crossing the Channel. The Short Straits’ share of the freight market (both Truck Shuttles and ferries) rose due to the success of the Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied mode and can be explained by various factors such as capacity increases and changes in the various operators’ pricing policies.

 b) Passenger market

 The international passenger transport market departing to and from the United Kingdom has grown steadily for several years with growth estimated at close to 4% in 2017 compared to 2016. (Source: UK

###### Office of National Statistics: Provisional estimations from International Passenger Survey at the end of October 2017).

 The Shuttles and the Short Straits ferries carry passengers travelling with their vehicles between Calais in France and Kent in the United Kingdom (Folkestone for the Shuttles or Dover for the ferries). Transport services for passengers travelling without their vehicles provided by airlines or by High-Speed Passenger Trains are a marginal and indirect source of competition to this service. Eurostar services principally operate in the transport market for passengers travelling without their vehicles between Paris and London and between Brussels and London. Eurostar’s main competitors are the airlines.

 Short Straits

 Day trips permanently declined following the end of duty free purchases in 1999, in favour of long stay (five days and over) and short stay (fewer than five days).

 c) Competitive position in the Short Straits market

 The Shuttle Services are in direct competition with the ferry services and compete indirectly with airlines and, to a lesser extent, with Eurostar.

 i. Ferry operators

 Cross-Channel ferry operators are using larger ships to handle greater volumes of traffic and to achieve economies of scale over the long term, looking for growth in the freight market rather than in the passenger market (cars).

 A public service delegation contract was signed by the Hauts-de-France region on 19 February 2015 in respect of the Calais Port 2015 project, aimed at merging the ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer and extending the port of Calais and in particular its ferry terminal. Work is under way with the creation of a platform on which future buildings, roads and bridges will be built (Source: www.spd-calais.com). On 10 April 2015, the Group filed with the Administrative Court of Lille an application for the annulment of the public service delegation contract, for breach of the principle of equality between candidates, distortion of the basis of public service delegation law and the granting of guarantees representing illegal State aid. The exchange of pleadings was completed in the autumn and the investigation was closed on 6 October 2017. The hearing date is not yet known.

 Construction has begun on a project to create a new terminal in the Western Docks at the port of Dover to accommodate larger ferries.

 Since 2015, only two ferry companies have operated on the Short Straits (P&O Ferries and DFDS Seaways), offering reduced capacity compared to that available previously.

 P&O

 P&O Ferries (‘‘P&O’’) is a subsidiary of DP World, a worldwide operator of port facilities.

 P&O is the largest ferry operator on the Short Straits, with six vessels, and is in direct competition with the Fixed Link in both the freight market and the passenger market.

 In 2017, P&O operated up to six vessels, two of which, at 210 metres, were the longest ships deployed on routes to and from Dover.

 DFDS Seaways

 DFDS Seaways (‘‘DFDS’’) is owned by the Danish company DFDS.

 In 2017, DFDS deployed three vessels on the Dover-Dunkirk route and three on the Calais-Dover route including two of the ferries that were previously owned by the Group, ‘‘Berlioz’’ and ‘‘Rodin’’, renamed ‘‘Cˆote des Dunes’’ and ‘‘Cˆote des Flandres’’.

###### ii. Shuttle Services

 Competitive advantages of the Shuttle Service

 The Group considers that, under normal operating conditions, its Shuttle Service benefits from the following competitive advantages over ferries:

 • safety: the Group offers a reinforced safety system at the site of Coquelles and additional means of control before boarding that reassure Truck Shuttle customers;

 • speed: the standard travel time between the French and British motorways is much shorter than that of its competitors;

 • departure frequency: the Shuttle Service runs more frequently than any of its competitors, and it runs every day of the year;

 • convenience: with the GSM-P system, Shuttle Services customers have uninterrupted access to GSM and 4G services in the Tunnel;

 • reliability: unlike the ferries, the Shuttle Service is not affected by sailing conditions and is not dependent on the weather; and

 • environmentally-friendly: the electric power it uses for traction generates much lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels.

 The Group has decided to further enhance these advantages by implementing a digital transformation plan focusing on six key areas (including service fluidity; customer experience; maintenance; and systems).

 Eurotunnel’s Shuttle Service also offers:

 • a freight service that is independent of the passenger service, which is subject to the seasonality of tourist traffic;

 • more efficient management of loading/unloading; and

 • the direct management of its terminals, in contrast to the ferries, for which port operations are managed by third parties.

 iii. Airlines

 Airlines, and particularly low cost airlines, also have an indirect impact on the Short Straits market. These companies serve many destinations in continental Europe and thus compete with operators in the Short Straits, including the Passenger Shuttle Service in the short stay leisure market. Many destinations in France are now served by low cost airlines offering an alternative means of transport between France and the United Kingdom.

 iv. Eurostar

 To a lesser extent, Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains compete indirectly with the Passenger Shuttle Service in the leisure market.

 1.2.2 FIXED LINK: ACTIVITIES

 The Fixed Link is an infrastructure that enables vehicles aboard Shuttles to cross the Channel: the Group operates and directly markets its Shuttle Services. High-Speed Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services may also travel through the Tunnel in return for payment of a toll: the Group does not operate these services, but manages their safe and efficient passage through the Railway Network.

 a) Shuttle transport activities

 The Group operates Truck Shuttles transporting heavy goods vehicles and Passenger Shuttles transporting passengers in their vehicles (cars, coaches, motorbikes, motor homes). In 2017, the Group earned 58% of its revenue from its Truck Shuttles and Passenger Shuttles offerings.

###### i. Truck Shuttle Service

 Introduction

 The Truck Shuttle Service carries trucks between France and the United Kingdom on Shuttle trains. On each terminal, drivers pass through dedicated check-in, security and border control facilities. Real time information has been improved (on-board information system with screens, customer information panels on the approach route and the ‘‘Elite’’ customer information processing software). Other facilities for trucks are located close to the terminals. Drivers and passengers do not remain in their vehicles during the crossing, but travel in a separate carriage (‘‘Club Cars’’ which were completely refurbished in 2014) specially designed for this purpose.

 The Truck Shuttle Service can operate up to seven departures per hour in each direction.

 Strategy

 Truck service marketing strategy

 The strategy is based on optimizing Truck Shuttle revenue and a pricing policy that reflects the value of the service provided by the Group, as well as its speed, ease and reliability.

 Throughout the year, the Group gives priority to customers under contract, only providing transport to occasional customers as available capacity allows. The Group has put in place a mechanism to optimise Truck Shuttle revenue based on a pricing policy consisting of more flexible prices, adjustable according to demand and available capacity. The aim is to encourage an improved distribution of truck flows at all times of day and all week long, so that capacity and load factors can be optimised whilst maintaining service quality during peak days.

 Truck Shuttle Service market share

 The Group estimates that its share of the Truck Shuttle Service market on the Short Straits corridor has evolved as follows:

**2017** **2016**
**Market share** **Market**
**Vehicles** **(estimate)[(1)]** **Vehicles** **share[(1)]**

###### Accompanied Trucks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,637,280 39.1% 1,641,638 39.2%

(1) The market share percentages are derived by calculating the Truck Shuttle Service’s truck traffic as a proportion of the total
accompanied truck traffic on the Short Straits market as reported by IRN Services Limited.

###### The cross-Channel truck market was stable in 2017 year-on-year (growth of 0.1%) after increasing over 5% in 2016, reaching a record high for the overall Short Straits market in 2017, despite the disruptions in the geopolitical environment since 2015.

 The number of trucks transported by the Truck Shuttles and their market share in 2017 remained relatively stable compared to 2016. However, the start of 2017 was affected by a temporary decrease in fresh fruit and vegetable traffic due to the exceptionally bad weather conditions in southern Europe. November was affected by a reduction in capacity due to a temporary increase in maintenance operations. These negative factors were compensated by a number of traffic records during the rest of the year and by record traffic for the second half of the year.

 ii. Passenger Shuttle Service (‘‘Le Shuttle’’)

 Introduction

 The Passenger Shuttle Service carries cars, motor homes, caravans, coaches, motorcycles and trailers between France and the United Kingdom on Shuttles. Customers remain in their vehicle throughout the crossing, which normally lasts approximately 35 minutes from platform to platform. Each Passenger Shuttle has two sections: a double deck section mainly for cars and motorcycles and a single deck section reserved for vehicles higher than 1.85 metres, mainly coaches, minibuses and cars with roof boxes or towing caravans.

 The Passenger Shuttle Service can operate up to five departures per hour in each direction.

-----

###### Strategy

 The business model aims to optimise Passenger Shuttle revenue by increasing the average revenue per Shuttle departure.

 Since 2016, the Fixed Link has been running a service specifically for commercial vans travelling on Passenger Shuttles, the VP (‘‘Van on Pax’’) service, which offers transporters the choice of travelling with their commercial vans on board Passenger Shuttles if they have a reservation. New scanners on the passenger terminals reinforce security measures for this service. By freeing up space on Truck Shuttles while filling up space on Passenger Shuttles, the VP service allows transporters to avoid peak periods for the Truck Shuttle Service and enables the company to optimise the use of available capacity.

 Pricing policy: Dynamic Pricing

 The pricing system adjusts ticket prices according to departure time and Shuttle load factor. This policy optimises passenger revenue and the average ticket price for passenger vehicles (cars, motor homes, caravans, motorcycles, etc.).

 Tickets can be bought in advance from the website (www.eurotunnel.com), by telephone from the customer service centre, from travel agents and on arrival at check-in. Currently more than 80% of Le Shuttle customer bookings are made online.

 Adapting capacity to demand

 The capacity of the Passenger Shuttle Service is constantly adjusted to improve load factors and reduce costs. Operational changes are made to constantly improve this strategy, such as better distribution of Shuttle departures during the day, fewer Passenger Shuttles running at off peak times and more during peak times and the optimisation of train crew management.

 This policy allows for an optimisation of the average load, which has increased from 45% in 2004 to 59% in 2017.

 The Customer Experience

 As a service business, Le Shuttle puts the customers at the core of its strategy and implements ways to enhance their satisfaction and loyalty:

 • Improved communication of real-time information, for each customer at every stage of their experience with the Group, with the roll-out of the digital transformation plan;

 • Personalisation of services, by taking into consideration the specific needs of each customer segment, such as owners of electric vehicles and those travelling with their pets. The Group works constantly to improve the service, renovating the passenger building on the Coquelles terminal (World Duty Free and lounge), enhancing real-time communication with customers through iBoarding, and installing fast universal chargers (for any type of electric vehicle) and specific charging points for Tesla cars. Since July 2017, the new William Turner building has welcomed Flexiplus premium customers in France and the new Claude Monet Flexiplus building on the UK terminal opened to customers on 18 May 2018;

 • The terminals are equipped with automatic terminals for check- in for all pre-reserved customers as well as a system that reads license plates. RFID technology (an electronic chip included in the transport document) has been introduced progressively since June 2016; and

 • In 2017, the Group launched the Fixed Link’s digital transformation project. This new collaborative digital vision is founded on five pillars comprising clear goals. Two of these pillars (in addition to optimizing infrastructure, data processing and corporate culture) relate directly to customer service:

 • Optimisation of flows on the terminals to further reduce transit times, by pooling data collection and equipping teams on the ground with digital tools enabling them to access and share this information; and

 • Enhancement of customer experience by meeting their basic needs and providing an internet connectivity and access to information, particularly in the event of disruption; overhaul of IT systems to implement an extensive, reliable and secure digital plan serving customers and terminal operations.

###### Passenger Shuttle Service market share

 The Group estimates that its share of the car and coach passenger markets on the Short Straits were as follows:

**2017** **2016**
**Market share** **Market**
**Vehicles** **(estimate)** **Vehicles** **Share**

###### Cars . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,595,247 54.9%[(1)] 2,610,242 55.0%[(1)]

(1) The market share percentages are calculated by converting the number of vehicles transported into Car Equivalent Units
(‘‘CEU’’) and determining the Passenger Shuttle Service’s share of total CEU transported on the Short Straits as reported by
IRN Services Limited.

(2) The market share percentages are calculated by determining the Passenger Shuttle Service’s share of the total number of
coaches transported on the Short Straits as reported by IRN Services Limited.

###### In contrast to the trend in the overall market, which increased 4% in 2017, the Short Straits car market remained relatively stable, with a slight contraction of 0.2%. Car market share remained relatively stable compared to the previous year, at 54.9%. Compared to 2016, cross-Channel car traffic in 2017 was affected by non-recurring events including the Euro football tournament in 2016 and elections in France and the UK in 2017.

 The Short Straits cross-Channel coach market contracted by approximately 7.0% in 2017, but the Passenger Shuttle’s coach market share increased by 1 point compared to the previous year, to 39.1%.

 b) Railway Network

 In 2017, the Group earned 28% of its revenue (32% of Fixed Link revenue) from the use of the Railway Network by High-Speed Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services. The Group does not operate these trains but manages their safe and efficient passage through the Tunnel infrastructure.

 The use of the Tunnel by the Railway Companies is governed by the Railway Usage Contract with the national Railways, which is in force until 2052. Under this charging framework, the Railways are obliged to pay to the Group variable charges according to the number of passengers on High-Speed Passenger Trains, as well as fixed annual charges. The variable charges are determined on the basis of a toll formula that applies throughout the life of the Railway Usage Contract, and which takes into account the effects of inflation to a certain extent. In addition, the Railways are required to contribute to the operating costs of the System, as well as to investment costs relating to the modernisation of equipment.

 This long-term pricing framework for the Railway Usage Contract is applied and published every year by the Concessionaires in the Network Statement, which sets out access conditions to the Railway Network for all Railway Companies, for the operation of High-Speed Passenger Trains and freight trains, as well as the pricing scale for the year under consideration. In this framework, a simplified pricing mechanism for freight trains was put in place, with charging per freight train instead of charging per ton of freight.

 The Group’s revenue from its Railway Network depends solely on variable charges received based on the number of passengers transported by Eurostar High-Speed Passenger Trains and the number of freight trains, as well as the annual fixed charges and the Railways’ contribution to operating costs.

 In 2017, the Group generated revenue of A293 million from the use of its Railway Network.

 i. High-Speed Passenger Trains

 Market developments

 The market for High-Speed Passenger Train services (Eurostar and future new market entrants) comprises business and leisure passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. The market is geographically diverse and includes, on the one hand, inter-capital travel between London and Paris or London and Brussels, and, on the other hand, a wider flow of passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Eurostar also operates a direct service to Disneyland Paris, and to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille during the spring and summer time and a service to Bourg-Saint-Maurice in winter.

###### The competitive environment of High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar)

 Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains connect London with the centre of Paris and Brussels and compete directly with traditional and low-cost airlines operating these routes in the business and leisure segments, in terms of travel time, frequency, comfort and price. In addition, for short-stay leisure trips, Eurostar also competes with low-cost airlines in terms of price, capacity and choice of destination, not only for destinations served by Eurostar, but also for other short-haul destinations. Within the framework of the liberalisation of the international rail passenger transport market, on 1 January 2010, the Group published its efficient and non-discriminatory conditions for access in its Network Statement. They offer all railway companies, including new entrants, the opportunity to operate cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Train services to existing or new destinations in competition with each other and with the airline sector.

 High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar)

 Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Train services are operated by Eurostar International Limited, owned 55% by SNCF, 5% by SNCB, and 40% by a consortium comprising CDPQ, the Caisse de d´epˆot et placement du Qu´ebec and Hermes Infrastructure.

 Since 2007, the High-Speed Passenger Trains services have benefited from the high-speed line between London and the Tunnel, which reduced the transit time between Paris and London or Brussels and London by around 20 minutes and London’s St Pancras International station, which improves rail links with Northern England (proximity of rail services from St Pancras, King’s Cross and Euston stations). Ebbsfleet International station, located near the M25 London orbital motorway, also allows Eurostar to expand its catchment area.

 In 2017, Eurostar ran 12 to 18 departures in each direction between Paris and London and 7 to 10 trains in each direction between London and Brussels on business days, with adjustments depending on the day, the season and the destination. Some trains make intermediate stops at Ebbsfleet or Ashford International in the United Kingdom and at Calais-Fr´ethun or Lille-Europe in France. Eurostar also runs a service to Disneyland Paris four to seven days a week (except in January) and seasonal services from London and Ashford to Bourg-Saint-Maurice with two return journeys a week (from December to April) as well as a spring/summer seasonal service (May to September) from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille with three or four return journeys a week.

-----

###### In 2017, the number of Eurostar passengers (travelling through the Tunnel) increased by 3% on average over the year to 10.3 million (Source: Eurostar) following a recovery in demand after a market context strongly affected in 2016 by the terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels and Nice. This recovery led to record traffic volumes at the end of the 2017. Prior to 2016, the number of Eurostar passengers have steadily increased year-on-year since 2003. Calculated in accordance with the pricing framework indexing formula set out in the Railway Usage Contract, the unit toll per passenger paid by Eurostar increased by 1.2% in 2017, as compared to 2016.

 Since November 2015, Eurostar has been progressively commissioning the 17 new e320 distributed drive trains ordered from Siemens. More comfortable (with on-board WiFi and individual sockets) and more powerful than the previous trains (top speed of 320km/h), they can accommodate 900 passengers (20% more than the original fleet) and are equipped with interoperable systems that are compatible with the development of services to new destinations. These trains are gradually replacing the majority of first generation trains after the test periods needed to eliminate any residual defects in the Eurostar rolling stock fleet, that also includes modernised Alstom e300 trains with a similar level of comfort to that of the e320.

 Development of new destinations

 In 2015, Eurostar launched a new direct service from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille, operating seasonally in the spring and summer months. However, this service requires passengers to disembark at the Lille station on the return trip for border controls and therefore there remains considerable potential for improving competitiveness.

 Eurostar announced on 9 February 2018 the start of its new direct service between London and Amsterdam which commenced in April 2018, and marks a historic milestone in the expansion of high-speed international rail travel. For the first time, passengers can travel from the heart of London directly to the Netherlands in only three hours at a speed of 300km/h. Initially, passengers will travel direct from London to Amsterdam and Rotterdam although in the direction Amsterdam to London, they will change at Brussels where passport and security checks will be carried out. This is a temporary measure while the UK and Dutch governments reach an agreement regarding passport checks on departure from the Netherlands, in the same way as happens for the other main Eurostar destinations. The governments have committed to putting in place an agreement before the end of 2019 in order to allow Eurostar to run a direct service in both directions.

 Further opportunities exist for services to Germany (Cologne, Frankfurt), southern France (Marseille, the French Riviera, Bordeaux) and/or Switzerland (Geneva).

 In 2010, Deutsche Bahn stated its intention to launch ICE High-Speed Passenger Train services from London to Cologne and Frankfurt. The operational outline was approved by the IGC in June 2013, but the schedule is yet to be confirmed due to project delays.

 To help accelerate the realisation of these opportunities, the Group has developed the ETICA-Pax (Eurotunnel Incentive for Capacity Additions—Passengers), a financial assistance mechanism for the launch of new cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Train services. Through the ETICA-Pax programme, the Group contributes to creating direct services to new destinations by reducing the launch cost of these new services and increasingly rewarding Railway Companies for their market development efforts.

 At the same time, the Group also continues its long-term efforts with national authorities and rail organisations to progressively eliminate the barriers to the development of new destinations (efficient security and border controls, rolling stock authorisations, investment in interoperability, improved access to stations, and long-term visibility). Significant progress has been achieved with the implementation of ‘‘open access’’ for international passenger services across Europe and the increasing application of interoperability standards, notably with efforts to standardise IGC technical requirements for cross- Channel High-Speed Passenger Trains. Further progress remains necessary, in particular with regards to border controls, to develop solutions that are efficient and tailored to the type of destination (juxtaposed controls for frequent services between capital cities and on-board control or controls on arrival for regular regional services) and thereby preserve the benefits of speed and convenience essential to the competitiveness of High-Speed Passenger Train services. The Group is working closely with rail infrastructure managers to facilitate the elimination of these barriers and the development of new direct destinations (notably on interoperability investments and boarding areas in stations).

###### ii. Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services

 Market developments

 Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services compete with most modes of sea and rail transport between continental Europe and the United Kingdom, offering their own advantages of efficiency and attractiveness with a Channel crossing without the need for modal shift, in a particularly environmentally- friendly means of transport and potentially a service quality independent of weather conditions and road networks.

 After a significant surge in traffic from 2010 to mid-2015, Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services traffic on the Fixed Link dropped by a half abruptly in the second half of 2015 due to disruption by migrants in the Calais area, before stabilizing in 2016 and returning to strong growth in 2017.

###### Competitive environment of the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services

 Rail freight through the Tunnel, originally developed by state-run Railways, has had a history of disappointing results and organisational difficulties. International rail freight is also held back by inadequate national infrastructure (in particular train gauge, length and weight restrictions in the UK, quality and availability of paths in France), distortions in favour of sea and road transport and excessive constraints (whether regulatory, social or technical).

 Rail freight trains are in competition with most modes of freight transport in operation between continental Europe and the United Kingdom and, in particular, with unaccompanied maritime services via the North Sea, with onward road or rail transport in continental Europe.

 Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services

 Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services between continental Europe and the United Kingdom are run by Railway Companies including DB Cargo (on behalf of BRB), SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Europorte, Rail Operations Group and potentially any freight train operator in open access. Three different types of freight trains use the Railway Network:

 • Intermodal trains, composed of platform wagons transporting containers or swap bodies;

 • conventional trains (carrying palletised goods in enclosed wagons or bulk loads in adapted wagons such as tankers, hoppers, platforms, etc.) carried as a trainload; and

 • trains with specialised wagons for transporting new cars.

 In order to revive cross-Channel rail freight, the Group adopted in 2007 a strategy based on three policies: (i) development of open access for rail freight operators, (ii) efficient processing of border constraints, and (iii) a simplified and competitive pricing policy.

 In 2017, the Group launched the construction of a full-train scanner on the national railway network in Fr´ethun, representing an investment of over A6 million. This scanner will enable customs officials to control freight trains moving at a speed of 20km/h, thereby enhancing the security and fluidity of cross- Channel rail freight and consequently its attractiveness. In addition, the Group extended its ETICA- Freight financial aid programme to support the launch of new services, generating a growing interest in the development of new services.

 In order for these growth efforts to produce their full effect, the Group continues to draw the attention of authorities to the need to progressively address the barriers to development existing on the national networks (size, length, capacity, quality, border constraints, etc.). These continue to hold back the development of cross-Channel rail freight and offer considerable potential for efficiencies waiting to be realised.

###### c) Other revenue

 The Fixed Link generated A18 million in other revenue in 2017, representing 2% of the Group’s total revenue. This other revenue consists mainly of (i) revenue from third party retail businesses in the terminals on both sides of the Tunnel, (ii) revenue for telecommunication lines in the Tunnel, (iii) revenue related to the property business, (iv) the sale of travel insurance products in the United Kingdom, (v) revenue related to CIFFCO training and (vi) a first revenue from Energy Savings Certificates generated by energy efficiency investment in third generation Truck Shuttles as detailed in chapter 6 of Annex A.

 For additional details on the Fixed Link capacities and reliability, please see sections 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 of Annex A.

 1.3 EUROPORTE ACTIVITIES

 1.3.1 EUROPORTE’S MAIN MARKETS
 According to figures published by the French Minist`ere de la Transition Ecologique et Solidaire, French[´] rail freight volumes totalled 32.6 billion ton kilometres in 2016, down 5% compared to 2015 (34.3 billion ton kilometres). Against this background, Europorte transported 1.7 billion ton kilometres in 2017, stable compared to 2016, representing an estimated market share of approximately 5%.

 1.3.2 EUROPORTE ACTIVITIES

 Thanks to its dense coverage in France, Europorte is positioned as a growth vehicle for the Group, present across the entire rail freight transport logistical chain, from collecting and routing on primary and secondary networks (‘‘Europorte France’’) or loading and unloading of wagons on private branch lines on industrial sites (‘‘Socorail’’), to managing rail infrastructure (ports, private and public/private industrial sites) in France and also in Belgium. Europorte is developing its various complementary activities concurrently in order to offer its customers complete and customised solutions that meet their expectations for integrated logistics chains and high quality of service.

 Revenue generated by Europorte’s activities in 2017 increased to A118 million, by 2% from 2016, stimulated by growth in the transport of chemical products.

 1.4 ELECLINK

 The ElecLink project involves the installation of a new electricity interconnector between the French and British grids. This will enable the import and export of electricity from one country to the other with a bi-directional transport capacity of 1,000 MW via a high-voltage direct current cable installed in the north rail tunnel under the Channel.

 In 2014, ElecLink obtained a regulatory derogation granted by the French Energy Regulation Commission (‘‘CRE’’) and its UK equivalent, the Office of Gas and Electricity (‘‘Ofgem’’). This regulatory derogation was also approved by the European Commission.

 Project construction formally commenced at the end of 2016 and ElecLink awarded the construction work to leading companies: Siemens is building the converter stations in France and the United Kingdom and Balfour Beatty/Prysmian were chosen to manufacture and install the direct current cables in the Tunnel and the underground alternating current cable in the United Kingdom. RTE is responsible for providing and installing the underground alternating current cable in France.

 As discussed in chapter 3 of Annex A, the construction, as with any new project, carries risks linked to its technical implementation and compliance with performance levels as well as the commissioning schedule, all within a regulatory context that may change.

 The safety of the project both in terms of construction safety and the operational safety of the cable in the Tunnel, is paramount to the Group and is the subject of detailed ongoing monitoring by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority of the IGC.

 The Group’s investment in this project is described in section 1.6 of Annex A.

 ElecLink successfully took part in a capacity auction organised from 6 to 8 February 2018 in the United Kingdom and won a capacity contract for the period October 2021 to September 2022. Following this first participation, ElecLink now has confirmed annual revenues for this period of approximately £5.8 million

 15


-----

###### (in 2016/17 values). These additional revenues will complement the main source of ElecLink’s revenue namely that arising from the marketing of its interconnector capacity (congestion rents), which will be the main source of ElecLink’s revenue.

 1.5 FIRST HALF 2018

 The Group’s results for the first half of 2018 reflect the orientations adopted within the framework of the strategic plan. They confirm the robustness of its business model focused on sustainable growth in its various business segments and on creating value for its shareholders.

 The results of the Shuttle business, with traffic growth of between 2 and 3% and revenue increasing by 5%, reflect the strategy of optimizing profitability through active management of prices, for both truck and car activities.

 This strategy, driven by an attractive commercial proposition based on quality of service and digitalisation of processes, is intended to generate continuous growth in Tunnel traffic whilst optimizing margins. The Group’s investment policy serves this strategy and, such as with the opening of the new Flexiplus lounge on the Folkestone terminal during the first half of 2018, the Group is continuing its targeted investments aimed at reinforcing service quality and modernizing its infrastructure and equipment.

 Despite the SNCF strike during the period, passenger high-speed train traffic travelling through the Tunnel continued the growth seen in 2017, and the launch in April 2018 of the new service between London and Amsterdam confirms the potential for growth of the rail transport market between the UK and the Continent over and above existing services and destinations.

 The Group remains very confident in the solidity of its Fixed Link business and in its potential for growth. The Fixed Link continues to be, and will increasingly assert itself as, the principle choice for trade and movement of people between the UK and continental Europe.

 The Group is closely following the negotiations on the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, which, with the recent publication of a white paper by the British Government, has entered an intense phase in the run-up to the effective date of 29 March 2019. Since 2016, the Group has been in constant contact with the French and British authorities and other stakeholders so as to be informed of potential changes to the framework for future cross-border controls and the definition of technological options to facilitate them. As a private company, manager of its own infrastructure and with 25 years of experience in the management of change, the Group remains confident in its ability (once the arrangements have been agreed between the parties) to deliver the solutions required to enable it to guarantee the fluidity of traffic through the Tunnel and to reinforce its position as a vital link in the European economic landscape. It is to be remembered that under the Treaty of Canterbury, the management of frontiers is the joint responsibility of the two States.

 Europorte continues its strategy of prioritizing the profitability of its operations and the quality of its services. Its performance in the first half of 2018, achieved despite the SNCF strikes, reinforces the Group’s objective of creating value in rail freight in France through managed growth and a high quality of service.

 The ElecLink project is progressing normally and is in line with both budget and timetable, except for a small shift in the deployment in the rail tunnel. The various studies and independent expert opinions requested by the IGC in order to give authorisation for the installation of the cable will be completed and delivered in the next few weeks. The objective of a start of operations at the beginning of 2020 remains valid.

 Following the completion of its corporate reorganisation in April 2018, the Group continues to work on the optimisation of its financing structure in order to minimise, as market conditions allow, the cost of its debt and to support its strategy to develop its core businesses of infrastructure and transport activities. The contemplated transactions involve a refinancing of the EASL external bank loan of £190 million (the ‘‘G2 Bridge Loan’’).

 1.6 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

 Reorganisation

 On 13 April 2018, the Group announced completion of its internal reorganisation. As part of that reorganisation, the Issuer contributed its shares in France Manche SA and The Channel Tunnel Group Ltd

 16


-----

###### into Eurotunnel Holding SAS to ring-fence the Group’s Fixed Link activities under the umbrella of Eurotunnel Holding SAS, thereby separating them from the other activities of the Group, including Europorte (rail freight), ElecLink (electricity interconnector between the UK and France) and property development. See ‘‘Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure’’ for the current simplified corporate structure of the Group.

 Financing

 On 9 February 2018, EASL acquired from FMS certain G2 Bonds with aggregate nominal value of £150 million. The purchase price of £359 million was financed, in part, by proceeds of an external loan of £190 million incurred by EASL and, in part, by the Group’s own funds.

 Recent trade data

 In 2016 and 2017, EY analysed key trade flows between the UK and the rest of Europe (Source: Ernst & Young LLP: Economic Footprint of the Channel Tunnel in the EU: An analysis of the value of trade travelling through the Channel Tunnel between the UK and EU countries, June 2018).

 The data revealed A69 billion worth of exports from the UK to the EU and A69 billion worth of exports from the EU to the UK in 2016. In 2016, the total value of exports from the EU to the UK transported through the Channel Tunnel represented 21% of the total value of such exports. The largest category of goods exports by value was postal and courier freight (A24.6 billion), followed by food and drink (A10.5 billion), computers and electronics (A10.2 billion), transport equipment (including retail of automotive parts (A6.6 billion)) and textiles, clothing and leather (A5.0 billion). The total value of goods transported per year was A138 billion, representing 26% of overall UK-EU trade.

 Trade with France, Germany and Spain, collectively, represented the majority of EU-UK trade that the Channel Tunnel facilitated in 2016. In the same period, the UK also had major trade flows via the Channel Tunnel with Belgium and the Netherlands.

 UK-France trade data

 Key data relating to trade flows between the UK and France were as follows:

 • A10.9 billion of goods by value were imported from France into the UK (which represented 26.7% of total trade between the two countries);

 • A11.1 billion of goods by value were imported from the UK into France (which represented 41.6% of total trade between the two countries);

 • 794 rail freight trains travelled between the two countries;

 • food and beverage industry was the most important part of trade; and

 • 12 million UK tourists visited France.

 UK-Germany trade data

 Key data relating to trade flows between the UK and Germany were as follows:

 • A15.0 billion of goods by value were imported from Germany into the UK (which represented 16.2% of total trade between the two countries);

 • A15.8 billion of goods by value were imported from the UK into Germany (which represented 33.7% of total trade between the two countries);

 • 541 rail freight trains travelled between the two countries;

 • automobile industry was the most important part of trade; and

 • 241,000 UK tourists visited Germany.

 UK-Spain trade data

###### • A5.2 billion of goods by value were imported from the UK into Spain (which represented 34.4% of total trade between the two countries);

 • 309 rail freight trains travelled between the two countries;

 • fruit and vegetables industry was the most important part of trade;

 • 80,000 UK tourists visited Spain; and

 • the Channel Tunnel supported 21% of all Spanish trade to the UK.

 Recent activities and developments

 Truck Shuttles

 The Group publishes its Truck Shuttle and Passenger Shuttle traffic monthly. The Truck Shuttle service increased its share of the Short Straits cross-Channel truck market from 39.2% for H1 2017 to 40.9% for H1 2018. In August 2018, ‘‘Le Shuttle Freight’’ (which the brand name for the Groups’ Truck Shuttle service) recorded the best August in its history with 130,926 trucks transported. The Truck Shuttle service has a consistent 39-40% market share, while commanding a A50-70 premium per crossing. The number of truck crossings has demonstrated growth over the past few years with 1.36 million crossings in 2013 and 1.64 million crossings in 2017. Between 1 January 2018 and 31 August 2018, approximately 1.1 million trucks have crossed the Channel on board the Group’s Truck Shuttles.

 Le Shuttle

 In H1 2018, almost 1.2 million passengers crossed the Channel with Le Shuttle. Le Shuttle passenger traffic in August 2018 increased 0.3% compared to August 2017 with 362,905 passenger vehicles transported. This matches the second best monthly traffic for cars carried in August 2015. Car volumes have been increasing gradually with 2.48 million passenger vehicles in 2013, compared to 2.60 million in 2017. Approximately 1.9 million passenger vehicles have been transported on Le Shuttle between 1 January 2018 and 31 August 2018. With traffic growth of 2.2% in H1 2018, the market share of Le Shuttle’s car activity remained relatively stable at 57.6%.

 Short Straits

 The Group continues to offer an all-weather service on the Short Straits, which is more frequent and up to three times faster than competition. In H1 2018, the Group’s principal competitors in this segment remained P&O (with 30% truck market share and 21% car market share) and DFDS (with 29% truck market share and 21% car market share).

 The Group allows over 200 crossings per day by direction compared to 28 crossings per day by direction for P&O and DFDS, respectively. Furthermore, the Group’s speed advantage is evidenced in its 35 minute crossing time compared to the 90-120 minute crossing time of its competitors.

 Eurostar

 On 4 April 2018, Eurostar announced the launch of its new service from Amsterdam and Rotterdam to London. On the Amsterdam—London section passengers travel by Thalys to Brussels Midi, where passport controls and security screening are be carried out, before boarding a Eurostar train direct to London. This connection will be a temporary measure whilst the governments in the UK and The Netherlands complete an agreement, which will enable passport checks to be conducted on departure in The Netherlands as in other key Eurostar destinations (juxtaposed controls have been arranged between Belgium, France and the United Kingdom to have immigration controls take place in advance of boarding the train, rather than on arrival at the final destination).

 The British and Dutch governments have committed to putting this agreement in place by the end of 2019, so that Eurostar passengers travelling between the UK and The Netherlands will be able to enjoy a direct service in both directions.

 As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, Eurostar is the only railway company operating passenger trains through the Tunnel. Despite fluctuations in passenger traffic in previous years as a result of terrorist attacks (especially in Paris, Brussels and Nice) and recent SNCF strikes in France, Eurostar has maintained approximately 80% of the London-Paris/Brussels passenger transportation market share.

###### European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS)

 The Group, HS1 Ltd, SNCF-R´eseau and S. A Infrabel are committed to join forces to coordinate the deployment of the European Rail Traffic Management System (‘‘ERTMS’’) on the Paris—Bruxelles— London rail triangle via the Channel Tunnel.

 ElecLink

19SEP201818253531

###### The works relating to ElecLink, which aims to build, deploy and exploit an electricity interconnector between France and the UK by the installation of two HVDC cables inside the Tunnel, are proceeding under the IGC’s control, in line with the forecast timescales and budget. Investment in the project during H1 2018 amounted to A116 million, bringing the total investment since the Group took full control of ElecLink in 2016 to A355 million (excluding initial investment in the joint venture). The first transformer was delivered on 7 September 2018. The Group is progressing the work in preparation for obtaining the safety authorisations from the IGC and its security committee and has submitted the required safety studies for consideration. For further discussion of ElecLink and associated risks, see section 3.1.2 (b) of Annex A.

 Brexit

 On 29 March 2019, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union and the separation agreement should be ratified by the European Parliament and the member states. Currently, the beginning of November 2018 is set as the deadline for concluding negotiations and reaching agreement on the form and length of the transition period. Since the UK voted to leave the EU, several milestones have been passed, however the outcome of separation discussions is uncertain, as is future economic, legislative and regulatory framework.

 The Group’s audit committee reviewed the Brexit risk on 23 July 2018. In view of approaching Brexit and Jacques Gounon’s proximity to the Governments involved, the General Meeting of the shareholders of the Issuer (the ‘‘General Meeting’’) approved amendments to the Group’s governance framework that will enable him to remain in office for an extended time (see ‘‘—Governance’’ below). Whatever the post-Brexit regulatory framework will be, the Group has ambitions to remain the leader in its market and will work to optimise traffic flows and fluidity, while providing the quality of service expected by its customers.

 Governance

 On 18 April 2018, the General Meeting of the Issuer:

 • appointed two new non-independent directors, Elisabetta de Bernardi di Valserra and Giovanni Castellucci. Both new non-independent directors represent Atlantia S.p.A, which took control of Aero I Global & International S.`a.r.l, the Issuer’s principal shareholder, on 2 March 2018;

 • approved amendments to the articles of association of the Issuer to appoint two directors to represent the staff, in accordance with applicable French law. At its plenary meeting held on 22 May 2018, the French Company Council unanimously nominated St´ephane Sauvage as a Staff Representative Director. At its meeting held on 6 June 2018, the European Works Council unanimously nominated Philippe Vanderbec as the second Staff Representative Director. These two appointments increased the total number of Directors of the Issuer to 15; and

-----

###### • renewed the mandates as Directors for a further four years of Corinne Bach, Patricia Hewitt, Jacques Gounon, Tim Yeo and Philippe Vasseur and voted to modify the articles of association of the Issuer to extend the maximum age of the Chief Executive Officer from 65 to 68, enabling the continuation of the mandate as Chief Executive Officer of Jacques Gounon.

 Share Buybacks

 ODDO BHF (which is a liquidity provider operating under a contract with the Group) purchased approximately A35 million worth of the Issuer’s shares in 2013, as compared to Anil in 2014, A14 million in 2015, A59 million in 2016 and A9 million in 2017.

 Capital expenditures

 The Group had capital expenditures of A135.6 million in FY 2015; A145.3 million (including A50.6 million relating to Eleclink) in FY 2016; A275.2 million (including A195.8 million relating to Eleclink) in FY 2017; A167.7 million (including A139.8 million relating to Eleclink) in H1 2017 and A110.6 million (including A79.1 million relating to Eleclink) in H1 2018, in each case, at published exchange rates for each relevant period).

 1.7 THE TRANSACTIONS

 The gross proceeds from the Offering are expected to be A500.0 million (assuming the Notes are issued at par).

 The Issuer intends to use the gross proceeds of the Offering to: (i) refinance the G2 Bridge Loan; (ii) finance capital expenditure in relation to Eleclink; (iii) finance other Eligible Green Assets; and (iv) pay fees expenses in relation to the foregoing (collectively, the ‘‘Transactions’’).

 For a description of the Group’s anticipated debt following the issuance of the Notes and the application of the net proceeds thereof, see ‘‘—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure’’, ‘‘Description of Notes’’, ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Capitalisation’’.

###### SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

 The following tables present the Issuer’s summary financial information as at and for each of FY 2015, FY 2016, FY 2017, H1 2017 and H1 2018 and should be read in conjunction with the information in Annex A (and the Annual Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Annex A) and Annex B. The French versions of the Annual Financial Statements were audited by KPMG Audit, a division of KPMG SA, and Mazars SA, as set forth in their audit reports thereon, and were prepared in accordance with IFRS. No financial information in this summary for H1 2017 or H1 2018 has been extracted from any audited financial statements of the Issuer.

 This section includes certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS, because the Group believes they provide investors with useful additional information to measure the Group’s performance, liquidity or capital expenditures. These non-IFRS financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS financial measures’’.

 The summary financial and other information set out below should also be read in conjunction with ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Data’’, ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalisation’’ included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

 The following tables also include certain unaudited consolidated financial information that has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on 30 June 2018 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted balance sheet items and (ii) on 1 July 2017 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted finance costs and other financial ratios. The unaudited Group as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Group’s financial position or finance costs or other as adjusted financial ratios would have been if the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom had occurred on such date, nor do they purport to project the Group’s net debt or finance costs at any future date.

###### RISK FACTORS

 An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in light of the risks described below and other information in this Offering Memorandum and their personal circumstances. The occurrence of any of the following events could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition and impair the Group’s ability to fulfil its obligations in respect of the Notes, potentially causing a loss of all or part of the investment made when purchasing the Notes.

 The risk factors described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all relevant risks and should be used as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Group, or that the Group currently deems immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

 This Offering Memorandum contains ‘‘forward-looking’’ statements that are based on assumptions and estimates, and subject to risks and uncertainties. The Group’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See ‘‘Cautionary Note Regarding Forward- Looking Statements’’.

 RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY OF THE GROUP

 See Section 3.1 of Annex A for a description of material risks related to the business and industry of the Group.

 RISKS RELATING TO THE GROUP’S DEBT PROFILE, STRUCTURE AND THE NOTES

 The Group’s leverage and debt servicing obligations could materially adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

 As at 30 June 2018, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Group’s as adjusted net debt would have been A and the Group’s ratio of as adjusted net debt to EBITDA for the two most recent fiscal half-year periods would have been x. For computations of the Group’s as adjusted net debt and ratio of as adjusted net debt to EBITDA, see ‘‘Summary—Summary Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Financial Data and Ratios’’. The Issuer expects use the gross proceeds of the Offering to (i) refinance the G2 Bridge Loan; (ii) finance capital expenditure in relation to Eleclink; (iii) finance other Eligible Green Assets; and (iv) pay fees expenses in relation to the Transactions. See ‘‘Use Of Proceeds’’, ‘‘Capitalisation’’ and ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’.

 The Group’s leverage can have important consequences for the Group’s business and operations, including:

 • making it more difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes and the Group’s other debt and liabilities;

 • requiring the Group to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on the Group’s debt, thus reducing the availability of the Group’s cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

 • increasing the Group’s vulnerability to a downturn in the Group’s business or economic or industry conditions;

 • placing the Group at a competitive disadvantage compared to the Group’s competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow;

 • limiting the Group’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Group’s business and its industry;

 • negatively impacting credit terms with the Group’s creditors;

 • restricting the Group from exploiting certain business opportunities; and

 30

###### • limiting the Group’s ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

 Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations, including under the Notes.

 The Group may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which indebtedness could further increase the Group’s leverage and may have terms that are more or less favourable than the terms of the Notes and the Group’s other existing indebtedness.

 The Group may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of the Group’s existing debt, to fund any future acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In connection with the Group’s financial strategy, the Group continually evaluates different financing alternatives, and the Group may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation of the Offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at the Group’s election, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering document. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes and the Group’s other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes and the Group’s other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favourable than the terms of the Notes or the Group’s other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Group will elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If the Group incurs new debt in addition to the Group’s current debt and the Notes, the related risks that the Group now faces, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section, could intensify.

 The Group is subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit its ability to finance the Group’s future operations and capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities.

 Among other things, the Trust Deed will limit the Group’s ability to:

 • incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

 • make restricted payments;

 • create or permit to exist certain liens;

 • transfer or sell assets; and

 • consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Group’s assets.

 In addition, the Group’s other financing documents (see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’) contain covenants that limit the Group’s ability to incur and assume debt and/or require the Group to maintain certain ratios.

 All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’. These covenants could limit the Group’s ability to finance the Group’s future operations and capital needs and the Group’s ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in the Group’s interest.

 If the Group fails to comply with any of these covenants, the Group will be in default under the Trust Deed and/or the Group’s other financing documents and/or the relevant debt instruments, as the case may be, and the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or the applicable creditors could declare the principal and accrued interest on the Notes or any applicable amounts under such other financing documents due and payable, after any applicable cure period. In addition, any such default could lead to an event of default and acceleration under the Group’s other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Trust Deed. These restrictions could materially adversely affect the Group’s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Group’s best interest. See ‘‘Description of Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’.

###### The Issuer is a holding company and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to meet its obligations under the Notes.

 The Issuer is a holding company. The Issuer has no material assets or liabilities, other than its holdings in, and intercompany loans to, its subsidiaries and it has not engaged in any operating activities. Repayment of indebtedness of the Issuer, including under the Notes, is dependent on the ability of the Group’s operating companies to make cash available to the Issuer, by dividend distributions, debt repayment, loans or otherwise. The Group’s operating companies may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their ability to, make distributions or advance upstream or downstream loans to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of the Group’s operating companies is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from these companies. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions or other payments from the operating companies of the Group, the Issuer may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the Notes, if there is insufficient liquidity at Issuer level to make the relevant payments.

 The Notes are subordinated to liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.

 The Issuer’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to any debt incurred by the Issuer or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. Any right of the Issuer to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganisation, assignment for the benefit of creditors, marshalling of assets and liabilities or any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of the Issuer’s indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realise proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary). Accordingly, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries. The terms and conditions of the Notes do not prohibit the Issuer’s subsidiaries from incurring such liabilities.

 The Group requires a significant amount of cash to service the Group’s debt and sustain the Group’s operations. The Group’s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond the Group’s control, and the Group may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt.

 The Group’s ability to make payments on, and to refinance, the Group’s indebtedness, to fund working capital and to make capital expenditures, will depend on the Group’s future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on the success of the Group’s business strategy and on economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the factors discussed, or referenced, in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section, many of which are beyond the Group’s control.

 The Issuer can provide no assurance that the Group’s business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to the Group to pay its debt, including payments due under the Notes, when due or to fund the Group’s other capital requirements or any operating losses. If the Group’s future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay the Group’s obligations as they mature or to fund the Group’s liquidity needs, the Group may be forced to:

 • reduce or delay the Group’s business activities or capital expenditures;

 • sell assets;

 • obtain additional debt or equity capital;

 • restructure or refinance all or part of the Group’s debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity; or

 • forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.

 The Issuer can provide no assurance that the Group will be able to accomplish these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of the Issuer’s credit rating, which could also harm the Issuer’s ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of the Group’s debt, including the Notes, limit, and any future debt may limit, the Group’s ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of the Group’s indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require the Group to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict the Group’s business and adversely affect the Group’s

 32


-----

###### financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets, which the Group could be required to dispose of can be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realised from such sale will be acceptable.

 The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Security.

 Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the Group will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Security securing the Notes.

 As a result of the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, certain amendments and waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement and in relation to the Security will have to be consented to by the required majority of creditors under the relevant indebtedness, including the Notes, the Credit Facilities, other pari passu and subordinated creditors and any outstanding hedging obligations. The required majority will vary with the type of amendment or waiver being sought and there may in certain circumstances be a requirement for unanimity. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for all the secured parties with respect to the Security. The Security Agent will act with respect to enforcement of the Security only at the direction of those super senior secured creditors whose unpaid amounts and undrawn commitments under the super senior secured liabilities at that time aggregate to more than 66.67% of the total aggregate amount of all of the super senior secured liabilities at that time (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’) or the pari passu creditors whose outstanding principal amounts (or unpaid amounts and undrawn commitments) at that time aggregate to more than 50% of the total amount of all the pari passu liabilities at that time (the ‘‘Majority Pari Passu Creditors’’). The Security Agent will generally act in accordance with the enforcement instructions of the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, but there are situations where it will act in accordance with instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors. It may prove difficult for the holders of any public debt sharing in the Security to give instructions to the Security Agent in a timely manner or at all, which may lead to the inability of the Security Agent to obtain instructions from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors and prevent it from taking enforcement or other actions in a timely manner or at all or require the Security Agent to act in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors instead.

 The Majority Super Senior Creditors or lenders of any other future class of debt that ranks pari passu with the Notes may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

 These arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Security in a manner that results in lower recoveries by the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence an enforcement action against the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Security could otherwise be impaired or reduced.

 Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, if the Security Agent sells Security comprising the shares of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action, claims under the Notes and the liens over any other assets of such subsidiaries securing the Notes may be released. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes—Security—Release of Security’’.

 Creditors under certain Credit Facilities and certain priority hedging liabilities will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Security sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes.

 The obligations under the Notes will be secured on a first priority basis. The Trust Deed will also permit the Security to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under certain future Credit Facilities and certain priority hedging obligations will be permitted to have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Security pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Security. As such, in the event of a relevant enforcement action, holders of Notes may not be able to recover on the Security if the outstanding claims under such future Credit Facilities and such hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realised. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Security by any creditor will, after all obligations under such Credit Facilities and such hedging obligations have been discharged from such

 33


-----

###### recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes, certain other hedging obligations and any other obligations secured by the Security.

 The proceeds from the enforcement of the Security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.

 The value of the Security and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Security will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Security in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the economies of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates its business and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Security should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such Security. All or a portion of the Security may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, the Issuer cannot assure Noteholders that there will be a market for the sale of the Security, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation.

 Part of Security will comprise pledges of share of Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Limited, which are subsidiaries of the Issuer. Such pledges, shares and ownership interests may be of no value if the relevant subsidiary is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, because all obligations of that entity must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity.

 The Security Agent may require the approval of the French regulatory authorities in order to enforce the share pledge over the shares of Eurotunnel Holding SAS.

 Under French law and regulations, foreign investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors of the country’s economy may require prior authorisation of competent French authorities. This requirement may affect enforcement of Security insofar as it comprises the pledge of shares in Eurotunnel Holding SAS.

 Where any of the sectors of French economy specified by law or regulations are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments, which are subject to prior authorisation:

 • a transaction, as a result of which a non-EU/EEA investor acquires (i) control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code); (ii) all or part of a business (branche d’activit´e); or (iii) more than 33.33% of the share capital or voting rights, in each case, of a company whose registered office is located in France;

 • a transaction, as a result of which an EU/EEA investor acquires (i) control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code); or (ii) all or part of a business (branche d’activit´e), in each case, of a company whose registered office is located in France; and

 • a transaction, as a result of which a French investor under non-French control acquires all or part of a business of a company whose registered office is located in France.

 On 14 May 2014, the French government issued a decree no. 2014-479, which amended foreign investment regulations and expanded the scope of sectors and activities, for which such prior authorisation. Under that decree, activities relating to equipment, products or services, which are critical to the French public order, public safety or national security (such as energy and water supply, public health, public transport and electronic communication), currently fall within the scope of French foreign investment control. Given the industries in which Eurotunnel Holding SAS operates, any transactions of the above nature in connection with the enforcement of the relevant Security may be subject to this decree.

 When a foreign investment is subject to prior authorisation of the French authorities, it cannot be completed prior to receipt of such authorisation. The foreign investor must submit a formal application and a decision must be rendered within two months of receipt (failing which the authorisation will be deemed granted).

 The Issuer can provide no assurance that the approval of the French authorities would not be required in order to allow the Security Agent to enforce Security constituting shares of Eurotunnel Holding SAS or that such approval, if required, will be granted.

 The security interests in the Security will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.

 The security interests in the Security will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes, but will be granted only in favour of the Security Agent. The Trustee for the Notes, on behalf of the holders of the

 34


-----

###### Notes, will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement with among others, the Security Agent. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security Documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Security by the Security Agent. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Security, except through the Security Agent, who will follow instructions as set forth under the caption ‘‘—The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Security’’. In addition, in certain circumstances, lenders under certain Credit Facilities will have the right to direct the Security Agent in enforcement actions with respect to the Security.

 Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the secured parties will appoint the Security Agent to act as security agent for the purpose of taking, registering (or causing to register), managing and enforcing any Security granted under the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim under the Security Documents governed by French law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of parallel debt obligations in favour of the Security Agent (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer (as principal obligor) towards the holders of the Notes under, or in connection with, the Trust Deed (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’).

 Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognised, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 no 10 25.533 Belv´ed`ere) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

 To the extent that the security interests in the Security created for the benefit of the Security Agent as the Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Security. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

 The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Trust Deed that become particularly important following defaults or events of default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee receives written notice, and subsequently acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

 The concept of ‘‘trust’’ has been recognised by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 no 10 25533 Belv´ed`ere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the New York law could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard (sauvegarde) proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of 1 July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of ‘‘trust’’ has not been generally recognised under French law.

 Secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement may be required to pay a ‘‘soulte’’ in the event they decide to enforce a pledge over securities of the French subsidiary of the Issuer by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Security consisting of such securities rather than by a sale of such Security in a public auction.

 Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) in connection with a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors); or (y) by way of the judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of non-judicial private attribution (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method.

 If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of attribution (whether judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) or private attribution (pacte commissoire)), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) or by an expert pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge

 35


-----

###### in the context of a private attribution (pacte commissoire). In any event, if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the pledged assets as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Security.

 Consequently, in the event that the lenders or investors under certain Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes are entitled to, and decide to, enforce the Security, which includes a pledge over the securities of Eurotunnel Holding SAS, through judicial or private attribution, and the value of such securities exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the lenders or investors under certain Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes may be required to pay immediately to the relevant pledgors a ‘‘soulte’’ equal to the amount, by which the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt.

 If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

 Alternatively, the lenders under certain Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes could decide to undertake the sale of the pledged securities by public auction. As public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of Eurotunnel Holding SAS as a going concern.

 The rights of Noteholders in the Security may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Security.

 Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets may not be enforceable or its priority retained, if certain actions are not undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security (including the registration of such security). The security interests securing the Notes may not be enforceable or priority retained if actions required to perfect any of these security interests are not taken.

 The insolvency laws of France may not be as favourable as insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which you are familiar and may limit or preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.

 The Issuer is organised under the laws of France. Main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer could be required to proceed under the laws of the jurisdiction in which its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (as defined in Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is situated at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced. Although there is a rebuttable presumption that the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ will be in the EU member state jurisdiction where its registered office is situated, this presumption is not conclusive. Accordingly, main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer may proceed under, and be governed by French insolvency laws or potentially by the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction if the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of the Issuer is determined to be in such other jurisdiction at the relevant time. The insolvency laws of such jurisdictions may not be as favourable to your interests as those of the United Kingdom or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations’’ for a description of the insolvency laws in France, which could limit the enforceability of the Security.

 In the event that the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it would not be possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the security interests in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

 Applicable law and other limitations on the enforceability of the Security may adversely affect its validity and enforceability.

 The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be, subject to the restrictions and limitations detailed herein, secured by the Security. The Security may be subject to claims that it should be limited or subordinated in favour of the Group’s existing and future creditors under any applicable law. In addition,

 36


-----

###### enforcement of the Security will be limited to the extent of the amount that can be secured by the Issuer without rendering the Security voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. Enforcement of the Security against the Issuer will be subject to certain defences available to security providers generally. These laws and defences include those that relate to insolvency, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalisation and defences affecting the rights of creditors generally.

 Events of default may occur without the knowledge of the Trustee if the Issuer fails to notify the Trustee of such event.

 The Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that the Trustee and the Security Agent will be entitled to assume, unless it is otherwise disclosed to it in its capacity as the Trustee or the Security Agent, respectively, or it is expressly informed otherwise, that no Default or Event of Default (as defined in ‘‘Description of Notes’’) has occurred and is continuing. The Trustee and/or the Security Agent, respectively, will not be required to monitor whether any such event has occurred. The Trustee and/or the Security Agent, respectively, shall not be obliged to make any such determinations and shall be able to conclusively rely on any document provided to it without being obliged to enquire as to the accuracy or validity of any such document. If the Issuer fails to notify the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, respectively, of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, it is likely that neither the Trustee nor any secured creditor including the holders of the Notes would know that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred, the occurrence of which may indicate that the Issuer or the Group as a whole is experiencing financial or other difficulties. The absence of such notice may result in the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, and any secured creditor being unable to enforce their rights in a timely manner, potentially resulting in greater losses on their investment that would have been the case had such notice of default been given by the Issuer when such notice might have first been delivered.

 Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments.

 The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisors to determine whether, and to what extent, the Notes are legal investments for it. The Notes can be used as security for indebtedness and other restrictions apply to the purchase or pledge of any of the Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

 Many of the covenants in the Trust Deed will cease to apply if the Notes are rated investment grade.

 Many of the covenants contained in the Trust Deed governing the Notes will cease to apply to the Notes and will be terminated and permanently cease to have effect beginning on the day that the Notes are rated investment grade, provided that at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants will include restrictions on, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions, incur indebtedness and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade or that if the Notes ever are rated investment grade they will maintain these ratings. However, termination of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Fall Away’’.

 Early redemption of the Notes may reduce the yield expected by the holders of the Notes.

 The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer as more fully described in ‘‘Description of Notes— Optional Redemption’’. In the event that the Issuer exercises the option to redeem the Notes, the holders of the Notes may suffer a lower than expected yield and may not be able to reinvest the funds on the same terms.

 The Group may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.

 The Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a ‘‘change of control’’ in relation to the Issuer. Upon the occurrence of a ‘‘change of control triggering event’’, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. If a change of control triggering event were to occur, the Issuer can provide no assurance that the it will have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes and any other indebtedness with similar provisions.

 37


-----

###### In addition, the Group’s other indebtedness may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to certain events or transactions that could constitute a change of control under the terms of the Trust Deed or other indebtedness. The inability to purchase the Notes or repay such other indebtedness upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event would constitute an event of default under the terms and conditions governing the Notes and such other indebtedness, which would trigger a cross- acceleration under the Notes and vice versa. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Change Of Control’’.

 Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.

 One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, the market, other risk factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of the Group’s financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

 As part of the process of obtaining ratings for the Notes, the Joint Global Coordinators and Active Bookrunners had initial discussions with, and submitted certain materials relating to, an additional internationally recognised rating agency other than the Rating Agencies. After submitting these materials to the additional rating agency the Joint Global Coordinators and Active Bookrunners did not proceed to appoint that rating agency to rate the Notes and has ultimately decided not to procure a public rating for the Notes from that rating agency. Had the Joint Global Coordinators and Active Bookrunners selected such additional rating agency to rate the Notes, no assurance can be given in relation to the ratings that such rating agency would have ultimately assigned to the Notes.

 Credit rating agencies other than the Rating Agencies could seek to rate the Notes without having been requested to do so by the Issuer. If such unsolicited ratings are lower than the comparable ratings assigned to the Notes by the Rating Agencies, those unsolicited ratings could have an adverse effect on the value of the Notes. Although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any statistical rating organisation, a statistical rating organisation might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the Issuer and the Joint Global Coordinators and Active Bookrunners. Unless the context otherwise requires, any references to ratings or rating in this Offering Memorandum are to ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies only.

 Transfers of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions.

 The Issuer has not agreed to register and does not intend to register the Notes under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The holders of the Notes may not offer to sell the Notes, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The Issuer has not undertaken to register the Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered and does not intend to register the Notes under any other country’s securities laws. Prospective investors in the Notes should read the discussion in the section entitled ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ for further information about these transfer restrictions. It is the obligation of the investors in the Notes to ensure that their subscription for or subsequent offers, sales or transfers of the Notes comply with any applicable securities laws.

 The market value of the Notes could decrease if the Group’s creditworthiness worsens.

 The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives the Group to be less likely to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due. This could occur, for example, because of the materialisation of any of the risks listed in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section. Even if the Group’s ability to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different perception. In addition, market participants’ estimation of the

 38


-----

###### creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the same business as the Group could adversely change, causing the market value of the Notes to fall. If any of these events occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than before the materialisation of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes could decrease.

 There is no established trading market for the Notes and no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able to sell them.

 There is no existing market for the Notes. The Issuer will make an application to list the Notes on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, but cannot guarantee the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Notes, the ability of the holders of the Notes to sell such Notes or the price at which they may be able to sell such Notes. Liquidity and future trading prices of the Notes depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, results of operations, the market for similar securities and general economic conditions. The Initial Purchasers have informed the Group that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. They are not, however, obligated to do so. Any market-making that is commenced may be halted at any time. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in the Group’s financial performance in the markets in which the Group operates may adversely affect the liquidity of any trading market in the Notes that does develop and any market price quoted for the Notes. As a result, the Group cannot ensure that an active trading market will actually develop for the Notes.

 Historically, markets for non-investment grade debt, such as the Notes, have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such debt. Any market for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes independent of the Group’s financial performance and prospects and may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes.

 The Notes may not remain listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin.

 Although the Issuer intends to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure prospective investors that the Notes will remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing of the Notes on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin or it becomes unduly onerous to maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to maintain such listing on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, provided that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognised listing exchange for high yield issuers, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin or another recognised listing exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with the Trust Deed, the delisting of the Notes from the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin or another stock exchange in accordance with the Trust Deed may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

 Prospective investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes.

 The Notes are denominated and payable in Euros. If prospective investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than Euros, an investment in the Notes entails foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the Euros, relative to the currency by reference to which such prospective investors measure their returns because of economic, political or other factors over which the Group has no control. Depreciation of the Euros, against the currency by reference to which prospective investors measure their respective investment returns could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return of the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure their investment returns. There may be tax consequences for prospective investors as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses for any investment in the Notes. Please see ‘‘Tax Considerations’’.

 The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore prospective investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.

 Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes, are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or the

-----

###### holders of the Notes. The common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream or their respective nominees will be the registered holders of the Regulation S Global Notes. After payment to Euroclear or Clearstream, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.

 Accordingly, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if it is not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, on the procedures of the participant through which it owns its interest, to exercise any rights and obligations as a holder of the Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form’’. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from the holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, or if applicable, from a participant in these systems. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable investors to vote on any matters or otherwise exercise their rights with respect to the Notes on a timely basis.

 Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default, unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if an investor owns a book-entry interest it will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer can provide no assurance that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of the investors’ rights under the Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form’’.

 The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors.

 Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

 • have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the merits and risks of investing in the Notes;

 • have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;

 • have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor’s currency;

 • understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and

 • be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect their investment and their ability to bear the applicable risks.

 Potential investors should not invest in the Notes unless they have the expertise (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall investment portfolio.

 The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to ‘‘green’’ assets.

 On 14 September 2018, DNV provided an opinion (the ‘‘DNV GL Second Party Opinion’’) assessing the alignment of the Notes with the 2018 Green Bond Principles. The DNV GL Second Party Opinion is not incorporated into, and does not form part of, this Offering Memorandum. Neither the Issuer, nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to (i) the suitability of any opinion or certification of any third party (whether or not solicited by the Issuer) or the Notes to fulfil any environmental and sustainability criteria; (ii) whether the Notes will meet investor criteria and expectations with regard to environmental impact and sustainability performance; (iii) whether the net proceeds will be used to finance Eligible Green Assets; or (iv) the characteristics of the Eligible Green Assets, including their environmental and sustainability criteria. The DNV GL Second Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and

###### other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. The DNV GL Second Party Opinion is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is only current as at the date that the DNV GL Second Party Opinion was initially issued. Each potential investor in the Notes must make its own determination with respect to the relevance of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum regarding the use of proceeds, and its purchase of Notes should be based upon such investigation as it deems necessary. A withdrawal of the DNV GL Second Party Opinion may affect the value of the Notes and/or may have consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in ‘‘green’’ assets.

 RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION

 The introduction of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (‘‘OECD’’) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (‘‘BEPS’’) may impact the Group’s effective rate of tax in future periods.

 In 2015, the OECD released various final reports under its BEPS action plan to reform the international tax system to prevent tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. The proposed actions have a very broad scope including, but not limited to, neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements, limiting base erosion involving interest deductions and other financial payments, countering harmful tax practices, preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances and mandatory disclosure rules. The final reports give countries and jurisdictions tools in order to implement new policies to prevent tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning, as does the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on 7 June 2017, that could increase the Group’s administrative efforts and impact existing structures.

 Furthermore, the European Commission published a corporate reform package proposal on 25 October 2016 including three new directive proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (the ‘‘CCCTB’’), which would be a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU; (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries; and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses, which could also impact the Group’s tax position in the future. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure). The favourable vote of the European Parliament took place on 15 March 2018.

 In parallel, on 12 July 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted a new EU Directive (Council Directive 2016/1164) laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market (the ‘‘ATAD’’). The ATAD provides for a number of anti-abuse measures, inspired by the OECD BEPS project, that notably include an earnings stripping rule that limits the deduction of interest in case of certain excess financing levels as described under ‘‘—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness’’, as well as rules targeting hybrid mismatch arrangements within the EU. On 29 May 2017, the European Council adopted Council Directive EU/2017/952 (the ‘‘ATAD 2’’), amending the ATAD, which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries. The EU member states will in principle have to implement the ATAD in their national legislation before 1 January 2020. However, such implementation rule has several exceptions, such as the possibility granted to EU member states having domestic targeted rules that are equally effective to the interest limitation rule set out in this directive to ask for the authorisation from the European Commission to defer their application until 1 January 2024 at the latest. The ATAD 2 would be applicable as from 1 January 2020, except for certain of its provisions which would be applicable as from 1 January 2022. The effective implementation of all the provisions of ATAD and ATAD 2 Directives could therefore take place at different times in the different EU member states.

 The adoption by the Council of the European Union of a EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where the Group operates may impact the financial results of the Group.

 The Council of the European Union adopted on 5 December 2017 its conclusions on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the ‘‘Council Conclusions’’), which is composed of two sub-lists (so called respectively the ‘‘Black List’’ and the ‘‘Grey List’’, together referred to hereinafter as the ‘‘EU List’’). The EU List was established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the Council (the ‘‘EU Code of Conduct Group’’) during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions. The first Black List, which shall be updated at least once a year, is currently composed of the following nine jurisdictions: American Samoa, Guam, Namibia, Palau,

 41


-----

###### Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Bahamas, the US Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis. Furthermore, the Council published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order to comply with the European Union screening criteria.

 Moreover, though there are no applicable sanctions yet, EU Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions. On 28 March 2018, a new French bill that aims to fight tax fraud (Projet de loi relatif `a la lutte contre la fraude) has been released by the French government that intends, under certain conditions, to expand the French tax regime regarding non-cooperative states and jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French tax code (Code g´en´eral des impˆots) (the ‘‘French Tax Code’’) to states and jurisdictions included into the Black List.

 French tax legislation may restrict the Group’s ability to use French tax loss carry-forwards and the services that the Group provides are subject to value added taxes and sales taxes that may increase.

 The Group may record deferred tax assets on its balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from discrepancies between the tax valuation and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss carry-forwards from its entities. The actual realisation of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French Tax Code, the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to A1 million plus 50% of the portion of taxable profit exceeding A1 million. Any reduction in the Group’s ability to use these assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax reassessment, or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on its business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.

 Also, the services that the Group provides to its clients are subject to value added taxes, sales taxes or other similar taxes. Tax rates may increase at any time, and any such increase could affect the Group’s business and the demand for its services, and thus reduce the Group’s operating profit, thereby negatively affecting its business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition and cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.

 French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.

 In addition to specific rules that limit deductibility of financial expenses, that are not applicable to the Group’s French companies, Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code provides for a general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses. Adjusted net financial expenses incurred by French companies that are not members of a French tax group (int´egration fiscale) must be added back to these companies’ taxable income for a portion equal to 25% of their amount in respect of fiscal years opened as from 1 January 2014, to the extent that such companies’ amount of adjusted net financial expenses exceeds A3 million in a given fiscal year. This interest deductibility limitation does not apply (among other exceptions) to: (i) financial expenses incurred by concessionaire companies in relation to the infrastructure assets acquired or built by them in the frame of the concession, provided that the concession agreement was concluded prior to 29 December 2012, and (ii) financial expenses incurred by holding companies the sole assets of which are shares in concessionaire companies referred to at (i). Under Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code, the same limitation is applicable for the determination of the French tax group’s taxable result (subject to the same exception). Therefore, adjusted net financial expenses incurred by French companies that are members of a French tax group (int´egration fiscale) with respect to loans granted by companies that are not members of such tax group must be added back to the French tax group’s taxable income for a portion equal to 25% of their amount in respect of fiscal years opened as from 1 January 2014, to the extent that the tax group companies’ aggregated adjusted net financial expenses exceeds A3 million in a given fiscal year.

 In addition, Article 212 § II of the French Tax Code, deductions of interest paid on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code or on loans granted by a third party but guaranteed by a related party may be limited. Deductions of interest paid on such loans may be disallowed in the fiscal year during which it is incurred if such interest exceeds each of the following: (i) the amount of interest multiplied by the ratio of (a) 1.5 times the company’s net equity and (b) the average amount of indebtedness owed to related parties (or to third parties assimilated to related parties) over the

 42


-----

###### relevant fiscal year; (ii) 25% of the company’s earnings before tax and extraordinary items (as adjusted); and (iii) the amount of interest accrued by the company from related parties. Deductions may be disallowed for the portion of interest that exceeds in a relevant fiscal year the highest of the above three limitations if such portion of interest exceeds A150,000. Specific rules apply to companies belonging to a French tax group (int´egration fiscale).

 Article 209 § IX of the French Tax Code imposes restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses incurred by a French company if such company has acquired shares of another company qualifying as ‘‘titres de participation’’ within the meaning of Article 219 § I a quinquies of the French Tax Code and if such acquiring company cannot demonstrate, with respect to the fiscal year in which the shares are acquired or the fiscal years running over a twelve-month period from the acquisition of such shares (for shares acquired in the course of a fiscal year opened as from 1 January 2012), that (i) the decisions relating to such acquired shares are actually taken by the acquiring company (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a company directly controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L 233-3 § I of the French commercial code (Code de commerce), that is located in France) and (ii) where the control or an influence is exercised over the company whose shares are acquired, such control or influence is exercised by the acquiring company (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a company directly controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L 233-3 § I of the French Code de commerce, that is located in France). The French Finance Act 2018 amended FTC, §209, IX by providing that foreign companies having their registered office in an EU member state or in a country that is part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and that has in effect a tax treaty with France that includes an administrative assistance clause (which includes Island, Norway et Liechtenstein) are assimilated to companies located in France for the purpose of said article.

 Finally, as from fiscal years ending on or after 25 September 2013, the deductibility of interest paid to a related party within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code is subject to an additional requirement. Pursuant to Article 212 § I of the French Tax Code (as amended by Article 22 of French Finance Law for 2014), interest deduction is possible only to the extent that the borrower demonstrates, upon request from the French tax authorities, that the lender is, for the current fiscal year and in relation the interest concerned, subject to an income tax equal at least to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules. Where the lender is domiciled or established outside France, reference to ‘‘corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules’’ means the corporate income tax liability that the lender would incur on the interest received if it were domiciled or established in France. Specific rules apply where the lender is a pass-through entity for French tax purposes or a collective investment scheme referred to in Articles L.214-1 to L.214-191 of the French monetary and financial code (which includes UCITSs and AIFs as well as other collective investment schemes such as SICAVs and SPPICAVs with a single shareholder) or a similar entity.

 If the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on its indebtedness were to be limited by the aforementioned tax rules provided for by Article 212 bis and/or Article 223 B bis and/or Article 212 § II and/or Article 209 § IX and/or Article 212 § I of the French Tax Code, the Group’s tax burden could increase and therefore negatively impact its financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the Group’s cash flow might also be negatively impacted should the Issuer have to pay additional amounts under the Notes as a result of the levying of withholding taxes which may be required by applicable law. See also ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes’’.

 Furthermore, the set of rules restricting the deductibility of interest under French tax law will be completed in the future pursuant to the transposition of the ATAD into French law. The ATAD includes, in particular, a mechanism under which adjusted net financial expenses incurred by an EU company will be deductible from its taxable results only up to 30% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, it being noted that net financial expenses may be deductible up to an amount of A3.0 million in a given fiscal year. The detailed implementation of such new rule in France remains largely unknown, including whether this rule will replace existing French limitation regimes or be added in full or in part to them.

 The ATAD should in principle enter into force in January 2020. EU member states that have, at the date of the entry into force of the ATAD, national targeted rules for preventing base erosion and profit shifting risk that are equally effective to the interest limitation rule set out by the ATAD may apply these targeted rules until the adoption by the OECD members of a minimum standard with regard to the four OECD

 43


-----

###### Action Items against BEPS (which purpose is to limit base erosion involving interest deductions and other financial payments) or, at the latest, until 1 January 2024, to the extent they had expressly applied to benefit from this derogation to the European Commission by 30 June 2017, and subject to its acceptance by the European Commission. The French government filed this derogation request with the European commission. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the response of the European commission (confirming that, in their view, French national targeted rules are equally effective to this interest limitation rule) has not been issued. However the French government launched a public consultation on 24 April 2018, regarding, inter alia, ATAD in which implementation of ATAD under French domestic law as from 1 January 2019 was presented as a possibility. Finally, the ATAD 2, which amended the ATAD, by, inter alia, extending the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries, may also impact the abovementioned anti-hybrid loans provisions.

 The above mentioned specific tax rules, as well as generally applicable tax principles may limit the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on its indebtedness incurred in France and may thus increase its tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations and reduce the cash flow available to service its indebtedness.

 The Group qualifies for the French employment incentive tax credit, which will decrease in 2018 and be replaced with a decrease in employee social charges beginning from 2019.

 In accordance with the IFRS accounting rules applicable as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Group is able to record a competitiveness and employment tax credit (cr´edit d’impˆot pour la comp´etitivit´e et l’emploi or ‘‘CICE’’), for which it is eligible as a deduction from personnel costs. The rate of this tax credit, which was equal to 6% for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2014, was increased to 7% for compensation paid on or after 1 January 2017 and then 6% for compensation paid on or after 1 January 2018. The CICE is computed on the basis of gross salaries paid in the course of each calendar year to employees whose wages are up to a maximum of 250% of the French statutory minimum wage.

 Pursuant to Article 86 of the Finance Law for 2018, France decided to repeal the CICE for salaries paid as from 1 January 2019. This will result in the elimination of the positive impact of the CICE on the Group’s results of operations. The French government balanced this by decreasing, under certain conditions, by six points the rate of one of the employer’s social security charges (cotisation patronale d’assurance maladie) as from 1 January 2019.

 There can be no assurance that such future decrease in employer social charges will have the exact same financial impact as the CICE for the Group.

 Changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof could negatively affect the Group’s business.

 The Group is subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect the Group’s tax position, including its effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, tax laws and regulations in France, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions where the Group operates are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. The Group often relies on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Group cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with the Group’s interpretation of these laws. If the Group’s tax positions are challenged by the relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require the Group to increase the costs of its products or services to track and collect such additional taxes, which could increase the Group’s costs of operations and negatively affect its business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. The Group is subject to tax audits by various local tax authorities. Such tax audits may result in additional tax, interest and penalty payments, which would negatively affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Group.

 The Issuer may redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law.

 All payments made under the Notes can be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any French income tax, provided that they are, and continue to be, officially listed in Ireland in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA States and are admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin.

 In the event that any withholding or deduction is required to be made for, or on account of, tax imposed by a relevant tax jurisdiction from payments due under the Notes, the Issuer will, subject to certain exceptions, pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the

 44


-----

###### holders of the Notes after such withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts, which would have been receivable in respect of the Notes in the absence of the withholding or deduction.

 If, as a result of certain changes in tax law in any relevant tax jurisdiction, the Issuer would become obligated to pay additional amounts in respect of the Notes, the Issuer will have the option (but not the obligation) of redeeming all (but not some) of the outstanding Notes in full at 100% of their principal amount together with accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to redeem the Notes in these circumstances. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes’’.

###### DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS

 The following descriptions are summaries of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of the Group’s debt and does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents.

 Term Loan

 See sections 8.1.4 and 8.1.5 of Annex A entitled ‘‘The Term Loan and Ancillary Agreements’’ and ‘‘Master Intra-Group Debt Agreement’’.

 Intercreditor Agreement

 On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer expects to enter into an intercreditor agreement (the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’) with, amongst others, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited as Initial High Yield Note Trustee and the BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited as Security Agent.

 The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

 • the relative ranking of certain debt (including debt incurred under certain Credit Facilities of the debtors);

 • when payments can be made in respect of the subordinated debt of the debtors;

 • when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the subordinated debt;

 • the terms pursuant to which the subordinated debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events; and

 The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions related to future indebtedness permitted by the Trust Deed that may be incurred by the Issuer and its subsidiaries which may be secured by the collateral securing the Notes, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any finance documentation then existing (including the Trust Deed). Such indebtedness will (i) have equivalent rights to (A) the holders of certain Credit Facilities and any new credit facility (together the ‘‘Credit Facilities’’) and (B) hedge counterparties holding hedging liabilities that have been designated as being a priority hedging liability for the purposes of, and in accordance with the terms of, the Intercreditor Agreement (such hedge counterparties being ‘‘Super Senior Hedge Counterparties’’), under the Intercreditor Agreement and will vote in the same class of creditors as the holders of the Credit Facilities and the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and certain indebtedness owed to the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties, being the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’), (ii) have equivalent rights to the holders of the Notes and the hedge counterparties which are not Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in respect of non-priority hedging liabilities (such hedge counterparties being the ‘‘Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties’’) under the Intercreditor Agreement and will vote in the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes and the Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Notes and certain indebtedness owed to the Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties, being the ‘‘Pari Passu Liabilities’’ and, together with the Super Senior Liabilities, the ‘‘Priority Creditor Liabilities’’) or (iii) have rights in respect of such indebtedness that will be limited as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the ‘‘Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities’’) including in respect of (A) when payments in respect of such indebtedness are permitted to be made, including the circumstances when payments in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities can be suspended (including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions in respect thereof)), (B) restrictions on when the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities can take enforcement action (including standstill provisions in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities) and (C) the ability of the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities to purchase Priority Creditor Liabilities in certain circumstances.

 By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

 The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

###### Ranking and Priority

 The Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) the liabilities owing to the holders of Super Senior Liabilities (as defined therein) and certain agent liabilities rank pari passu in right and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to (A) the liabilities owing to the holders of Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined therein) and certain agent liabilities which rank pari passu in right and priority of payment between themselves and, in turn, in priority to (B) the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities (as defined therein) and (C) all intra-group liabilities owed to intra-group creditors (the ‘‘Intra-Group Creditors’’), (2) the liabilities owing to the holders of Pari Passu Liabilities rank behind the holders of the Super Senior Liabilities, (3) the liabilities owing to the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities rank behind the holders of the Priority Creditor Liabilities and certain agent liabilities but in priority to the Intra-Group Creditors and (4) the liabilities of the Intra-Group Creditors are postponed and subordinated to the Priority Creditor Liabilities, certain agent liabilities and Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities and the Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank such liabilities as between themselves.

 The holders of the Priority Creditor Liabilities, the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities and the Intra-Group Creditors are referred to as the ‘‘Creditors’’.

 Guarantees and Security

 The lenders under the Credit Facilities, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Notes and the holders of the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities will benefit from a common guarantee and security package (the ‘‘Transaction Security’’). The liabilities owing to the Credit Facilities lenders, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Notes and the holders of the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities would, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be guaranteed by the same debtors to the extent any such guarantee is offered and are secured by the same Transaction Security. To the extent permitted by the Trust Deed, holders of other Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities are entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to receive the benefit of Transaction Security on the basis set forth in ‘‘—Priority of Security’’ below.

 The Intercreditor Agreement contains covenants restricting holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities from taking any additional guarantees or security from the group unless offered to the benefit of all holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities. Unless there is a legal restriction on doing so, the Security Agent holds the Transaction Security for the benefit of the holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities to the extent each has the benefit of Transaction Security.

 No Transaction Security will become enforceable until the occurrence of an applicable acceleration event.

 Priority of Security

 The Transaction Security ranks and secures the liabilities in respect of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities (to the extent such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities and irrespective of the date on which such Transaction Security was created and/or perfected) in the following order, first the liabilities in respect of Super Senior Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them; secondly the liabilities in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them; and thirdly the liabilities in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them, with the proceeds of the Transaction Security to be applied as described under ‘‘—Application of Recoveries’’ below.

 Entitlement to Enforce Transaction Security

 There are no restrictions on enforcement of Transaction Security by holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities (other than (i) certain restrictions in the case of Super Senior Hedge Counterparties and Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties as described under ‘‘—Additional Restrictions’’ below and (ii) in the case of liabilities owed to any ancillary lenders or issuing banks, enforcement action by these parties is restricted until the final discharge of all other Super Senior Liabilities), provided that no such creditor may enforce Transaction Security other than in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Prior to the final discharge date of all Priority Creditor Liabilities, the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities may only take certain enforcement action against the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries in respect of liabilities in relation to Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities or any Transaction Security (i) if (A) an event of default under any agreement or instrument in respect of Subordinated High Yield

 49


-----

###### Note Liabilities is continuing (the occurrence of which has been notified to the relevant representative, agents and/or trustees of any Priority Creditor Liabilities by the relevant trustee of the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities) and (B) a period of 179 days has elapsed since the date of such notice referred to in (A) (or such earlier time contemplated in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the applicable event of default referred to in (A) is continuing, or, (ii) in respect of enforcement action in relation to a particular debtor of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities that is the subject of an insolvency event.

 Additional Restrictions

 The Intercreditor Agreement restricts (among other things) with respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries:

 • the ability of the hedge counterparties to take any enforcement action except for certain specified permitted enforcement actions;

 • the ability of intra-group debtors to pay, prepay, repay, redeem, defease or discharge or acquire intra -group liabilities except for certain specified permitted payments;

 • the ability of the intra-group lenders to take any enforcement action except for certain specified permitted enforcement actions; and

 • the ability of the intra-group lenders to take the benefit of any guarantees or security.

 In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security and guarantees relating to Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities will be released in certain circumstances described further below in ‘‘—Release of Security and Guarantees—Non-Distressed Disposals’’ and ‘‘—Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals’’. Moreover, certain proceeds received by holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities must be turned over to the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. See further below in ‘‘—Turnover’’.

 Effect of an Insolvency Event

 After the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the group, any party to the Intercreditor Agreement entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the group in respect of liabilities owed to it shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the secured parties have been paid in full. After the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the group, each secured party irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) to:

 (a) exercise any right it may otherwise have in respect of that member of the group with respect to that member of the group’s liabilities to, amongst other things, accelerate any of that member of the group’s liabilities or declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

 (b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member of the group in respect of any liabilities;

 (c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any liabilities of that member of the group; or

 (d) claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the group for such liabilities owing to it.

 Each Creditor shall (a) do all things the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) requests in order to give effect to the above actions and (b) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the above actions or requests that a Creditor takes that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent to enable it to take such actions.

 Release of Security and Guarantees—Non-Distressed Disposals

 The Security Agent is permitted to release Transaction Security over any asset if, in respect of a disposal of an asset by a debtor or an asset which is subject to the Transaction Security or a merger, reorganisation or other transaction whereby a release of an asset which is subject to the Transaction Security is required:

 (a) such disposal is not prohibited under the terms of any Credit Facility Agreement;

 50

###### (b) the Issuer has certified to the Security Agent in writing that such disposal and release is not prohibited under the terms of any agreement or instrument in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities or the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities and a director of or the relevant holder of the Pari Passu Liabilities or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities have authorised the release; and

 (c) such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined and set out more fully in ‘‘—Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals’’ below).

 Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals

 In relation to the disposal of an asset of a member of the group which is (i) being effected at the request of the instructing group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable, (ii) being effected by the enforcement of the Transaction Security or (iii) (in the case of a disposal by a Debtor to a person which is not a member of the group) following an acceleration of Priority Creditor Liabilities (other than under any hedging agreement) and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities or the enforcement of any Transaction Security (a ‘‘Distressed Disposal’’), the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, other secured party or debtor) to:

 (a) release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallisation of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

###### DESCRIPTION OF NOTES

 Getlink SE (formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE), a European company with a registered office at 3 rue La Bo´etie, Paris, France, registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Registry under registration number 483 385 142 (the ‘‘Issuer’’) will issue A500.0 million is aggregate principal amount % Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the ‘‘Notes’’) under a trust deed, to be dated as at 2018 (the ‘‘Trust Deed’’), between the Issuer and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’). On the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an agency agreement (the ‘‘Agency Agreement’’) with The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent, registrar and transfer agent.

 The Security Documents referred to below under the caption ‘‘—Security’’ define the terms of the security interests that will secure the Notes. This ‘‘Description of Notes’’ summarizes certain provisions of the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, but does not restate the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents in their entirety. Investors are therefore urged to read the Trust Deed and the Security Documents because they, and not this description, will define their rights as Holders of the Notes. Unless specifically stated otherwise, capitalized terms used, but not defined in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’, have the meanings given to them in ‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’ Copies of the Trust Deed (which includes the Conditions and the form of Notes) and the Security Documents may be obtained, when available, upon written request, from the Issuer.

 When this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ refers to the ‘‘Notes,’’ its means the Notes originally issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Notes, as described below under ‘‘Additional Notes.’’ The terms and conditions of the Notes are summarised below and are set out in full in the Trust Deed.

 The registered holder of a Note (a ‘‘Holder’’) will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Security Documents. As described in ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,’’ the Notes will initially be issued in global form deposited with or on behalf of a common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear (each as defined in ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’) and registered in the name of the nominee of such common depositary. The common depositary will initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch (the ‘‘Common Depositary’’). Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights, and the Notes will be subject to transfer restrictions. See ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and ‘‘—Transfer and Exchange.’’ Each Global Note will contain provisions, which modify the Conditions as they apply to Global Notes.

 Brief Description of Notes

 The Notes will:

 • be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

 • rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

 • be secured on an equal and ratable basis with all obligations of the Issuer constituting Pari Passu Liabilities by a first priority Lien on Security; provided, however, that pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of any collection, sale, disposition or other realization of Security received in connection with the exercise of remedies will be applied first to repay any Priority Creditor Liabilities (including obligations under any permitted super senior revolving credit facilities and certain hedging arrangements) prior to the Notes and any other Pari Passu Liabilities;

 • rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer, if any;

 • be effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the Security;

 • be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by Liens on property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property or assets so securing such Indebtedness;

 • be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including interest payables, trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries;

 57


-----

###### • mature on  2023; and

 • be initially represented by one or more Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances can be represented by Individual Note Certificates.

 General

 The Issuer is a holding company without operations, and, therefore, the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including interest payables, trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer to receive assets of a Subsidiary upon such Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the relevant Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinate in right of payment to any security in the assets of the Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Group’s Debt Profile, Structure and the Notes—The Notes are Subordinated to liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries’’.

 As of 30 June 2018, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom to repay the G2 Bridge Loan: (i) the Issuer would have had A500 million of total borrowings (including the Notes); and (ii) the Issuer’s Subsidiaries would have had A5,426 million of total liabilities (including interest payables, trade payables, hedging and retirement obligations, but excluding intercompany liabilities), all of which would have been structurally senior to the Notes.

 As at the Issue Date, no Issuer’s Subsidiary will be an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’. The Issuer’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Conditions.

 Additional Notes

 Subject to the limitations set forth under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Issuer may incur additional Indebtedness. At the Issuer’s option, this additional Indebtedness may consist of additional Notes (‘‘Additional Notes’’) issued in one or more transactions, which have substantially identical terms (other than issue price, issue date and first interest payment date) as the Notes issued on the Issue Date; provided, that Additional Notes will not bear the same common code or other security identification number as the Notes issued on the Issue Date, unless such Additional Notes are fungible with the outstanding Notes issued on the Issue Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Holders of Additional Notes would have the right to vote together with Holders of the Notes issued on the Issue Date as one class under the Conditions.

 Principal, Maturity and Interest

 The Issuer will initially issue A500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes, but may issue an unlimited principal amount of Notes under the Trust Deed, subject to the conditions to the issuance of Additional Notes set forth in the Trust Deed.

 The Issuer will issue the Notes in minimum denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on  2023. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and 30 December of each year, commencing on 30 December 2018. Payments will be made to the persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on 15 June and 15 December, respectively, immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

 Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent

 The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a ‘‘Paying Agent’’) in the City of London. The initial sole Paying Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer will also

 58


-----

###### maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’) and transfer agents (each, a ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer may, however, change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent without consent of, and prior notice to, the Holders. For so long as the Notes are listed, and admitted for trading, on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in accordance with the requirements of such rules.

 The Issuer will pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on, Notes in global form deposited with or on behalf of the Common Depositary and registered in the name of the nominee for the Common Depositary in immediately available funds to the Paying Agent for further payment to Holders. Investors in the Notes will receive payments of such amounts subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’. Interest on Notes held as Individual Note Certificates, if any, will be payable to Holders by wire transfer in immediately available funds to that Holder’s account. All other payments on Notes held as Individual Note Certificates will be made at the office or agency of a Paying Agent and Registrar unless the Issuer elects to make payments.

 Investors in the Notes will be subject to foreign exchange risks as to payments of any such amounts that may have important economic and tax consequences to them. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Group’s Debt Profile, Structure and the Notes—Prospective investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes’’.

 Transfer and Exchange

 The Notes will initially be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons (the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with, and registered in the name of, the nominee of the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

 Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and the Agency Agreement. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

 If Individual Note Certificates are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of A100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or the Conditions. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Individual Note Certificates issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Trust Deed or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’.

 Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Individual Note Certificates may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of A100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Conditions will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, (a) furnish (i) appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, (ii) information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, (iii) certain certificates and opinions, and (b) pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to Holders, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Individual Note Certificates:

 (1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Individual Note Certificates;

 (2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Individual Note Certificates to be redeemed in part;

 59


-----

###### (3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to such Individual Note Certificates; or

 (4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

 The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

 Security

 General

 The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be secured by the first ranking (a) pledges over all of the shares of Capital Stock of each Pledged Subsidiary; and (b) charge over the Debt Service Reserve Account (collectively, the ‘‘Security’’), in each case, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. As at the Issue Date, the Pledged Subsidiaries will be Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Ltd.

 On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer and the Security Agent will enter into (i) pledge agreements (the ‘‘Pledge Agreements’’) evidencing the liens referred to in (a) above; and (ii) the security agreement (the ‘‘DSRA Security Agreement’’) evidencing the lien referred to in (b) above.

 The Security will also secure on a first-priority basis certain of the Issuer’s future Indebtedness (including certain Hedging Obligations) and other obligations permitted under the Conditions to be so secured, provided that an authorized representative of the holders of such Indebtedness shall have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement. However, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of any collection, sale, disposition or other realization of Security received in connection with the exercise of remedies (including distributions of cash, securities or other property on account of the value of the Security in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceedings) will be applied first to repay the Indebtedness and other obligations (including any post-petition interest with respect thereto) permitted to be incurred under clauses (a) and (e) of paragraph (2) of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness,’’ including any obligations incurred under permitted super senior revolving credit facilities and certain Hedging Obligations (the ‘‘Priority Creditor Liabilities’’), before any Holder receives any proceeds.

 So long as no Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and conditions, the Issuer will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Security and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Security.

 Administration of Security

 The Security Documents and the Security will be administered by the Security Agent for the benefit of, among others, the Security Agent, the Trustee, Holders of the Notes and other secured creditors who have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, each Holder of the Notes will be deemed to have:

 • irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as security agent under the Security Documents; and

 • irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Security Documents or other documents to which it is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

 Application of Proceeds from the Security

 Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds realized by the Trustee, the Security Agent or the trustees or agents for any other series of Pari Passu Liabilities or Priority Creditor Liabilities (including certain Hedging Obligations) from realisation or enforcement of the Security will be applied:

 • first, to the payment of all sums owed to the Security Agent, the Trustee and any other creditor representative (in their respective capacities as such);

 • second, to the payment in full of all costs and expenses incurred by creditors for the Priority Creditor Liabilities or Pari Passu Liabilities in connection with such realisation or enforcement;

 60


-----

###### • third, to the payment in full of all remaining Priority Creditor Liabilities, the amounts so applied to be distributed on a pari passu basis to each series of Priority Creditor Liabilities for distribution in accordance with the applicable agreements or documents governing the Priority Creditor Liabilities;

 • fourth, to the payment in full of all remaining Pari Passu Liabilities, the amounts so applied to be distributed on a pari passu basis to each series of Pari Passu Liabilities for distribution in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements or documents governing the Pari Passu Liabilities;

 • fifth, to the payment of any holder and their creditor representative in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

 • sixth, to the payment of any other creditor to whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to the Issuer; and

 • seventh, to the Issuer.

 If the net proceeds of any of the Security were not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Security) would have only an unsecured claim against the remaining assets of the Issuer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Debt Profile Structure and the Notes—The Proceeds from the enforcement of the Security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes’’.

 Release of Security

 The Liens on the Security will be released with respect to the Notes:

 (1) in whole, upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Trust Deed and the Notes (other than contingent obligations that may arise in the future for indemnities or otherwise);

 (2) in part, as to any property constituting Security that is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Issuer in a transaction permitted by ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales’’ (to the extent of the interest sold or disposed of); provided that if required to effect a transaction resulting in any such release, it may occur contemporaneously with or prior to such transaction if the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee setting forth in reasonable detail such requirement;

 (3) in whole or in part, with the consent of Holders of the requisite percentage of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions;

 (4) in whole, upon satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as provided under ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

 (5) if, at any time the Security Agent enforces or otherwise exercises remedies against any Security in accordance with Clause 12 of the Intercreditor Agreement;

 (6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the Conditions, the release of the property and assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;

 (7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

 (8) otherwise as permitted in accordance with the Conditions, the Trust Deed, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents.

 Upon release of the Security, but subject to the rights of any holder of Priority Creditor Liabilities or other Pari Passu Liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement, Priority Debt Document (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or Security Document, the Security Agent shall (at the Issuers expense) take such actions as reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to reconvey to the Issuer the released Security.

 Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders of the Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by the Trustee to effect such release).

 Sufficiency of Security

 The fair market value of the Security is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of the Issuer’s Group industry, the ability to sell the Security in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale

 61


-----

###### of the Security would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Security at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Security may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Security can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, the ability of the Holders to realize upon any of the Security may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations, as described below.

 In addition, distribution of the proceeds from the Security may be subject to the rights of any holder of Pari Passu Liabilities or Priority Creditor Liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Additional Amounts

 All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any successor thereto (each, a ‘‘Payor’’) under, or with respect to, the Notes will be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including penalties, interest and other liabilities related thereto) (collectively, ‘‘Taxes’’) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or the interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed, levied, collected or assessed by or on behalf of (1) France or the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein, respectively, having power to tax, (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes is made on behalf of the Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax or (3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, resident or deemed to be doing business, or any political or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’) will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes, including payments of principal, premium, if any, redemption price or interest, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts paid by the Payor or its agent in respect of such payments to each Holder or beneficial owner, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been paid to each Holder or beneficial owner in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

 (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being or having been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein, but excluding any connection arising merely from the receipt of such payment or the acquisition or ownership of the Notes or enforcement of rights thereunder);

 (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property or similar tax, including excise taxes imposed on subsequent transfers of the Notes;

 (3) any Taxes which are imposed, payable or due because the Notes are held in the form of Individual Note Certificates and are presented (where presentation is required) for payment more than 30 days after the date such payment was due and payable or was first provided for, whichever is later, except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been imposed had the Holder presented its Individual Note Certificates for payment on the last day of such 30-day period;

 (4) any Taxes which are imposed on, or with respect to, or withheld or deducted from, a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner of Notes, which would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

 (5) any Taxes which are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner of a Note to comply, at the Issuer’s written request, with certification, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection of the Holder or such beneficial owner with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or to make, at the Issuer’s written request, any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled if (a) such

 62


-----

###### compliance, making a claim or filing for exemption is required or imposed by a statute, treaty or regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes, and (b) the Payor has given the Holder at least 30 days’ notice that the Holder or beneficial owner will be required to comply with such certification, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement, or make such claim or filing for exemption;

 (6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Notes;

 (7) any withholding or deduction that is imposed in connection with Sections 1471–1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (‘‘FATCA’’), any intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction implementing, or relating to, FATCA or any law, regulation or official guidance enacted or issued in any jurisdiction with respect thereto;

 (8) any payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest on such Note to any Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such a partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Note directly;

 (9) any payment made to an account opened in the name of, or for the benefit of, any Holder in a financial institution situated in a non-cooperative state or territory (Etat ou territoire non-coop´eratif) as set out in the list referred to in article 238-0 A of the French Code g´en´eral des impˆots, as such list may be amended from time to time; or

 (10) any combination of the above.

 The Payor will (1) make any required withholding or deduction and (2) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the applicable taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts or other available documentation evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and upon request will provide any such certified copies or other documentation obtained to the Paying Agent.

 If the Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes, the Payor will deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the relevant payment date, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders of the Notes on the payment date. Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon by the Paying Agent without further enquiry until receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters.

 The foregoing obligations will survive any termination or discharge of the Trust Deed and will apply mutatis mutandis to any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction with respect to any successor Person to a Payor.

 Whenever in the Trust Deed, the Conditions or in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context, (1) the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, (2) redemption prices in connection with the redemption of the Notes or (3) any other amount payable under or with respect to the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

 Optional Redemption

 Optional Redemption. Prior to  2020, the Issuer will have the right, at its option, to redeem Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as at, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

 At any time, or from time to time, after  2020, the Issuer may redeem Notes, at its option, in whole or in part, at the following redemption prices, expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date

 Optional Redemption upon Equity Event. At any time, or from time to time, on or prior to  2020, the Issuer may, at its option, use the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Events to redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of Additional Notes, if any) at a redemption price in cash equal to % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that (i) at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of Additional Notes, if any) must remain outstanding immediately after giving effect to each such redemption (excluding the Notes held by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries) and (ii) such redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the closing of the relevant Equity Event.

 Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes. If, as a result of any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or any rulings, rules or regulations thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or any amendment to or change in an official interpretation or application of such laws, rulings, rules or regulations (including by virtue of a judgment, order by a court or change in published administrative practice), which amendment or change becomes announced and effective on or after the date of the Offering Memorandum (or in the case where a jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Offering Memorandum, such later date), the relevant Payor would be obligated, after taking all reasonable measures to avoid this requirement, to pay Additional Amounts (provided that the relevant Payor shall not be required to take any measures that, in its reasonable determination, would result in the imposition on it of any material legal or regulatory burden or the incurrence by it of any material costs, or would otherwise result in any material adverse consequences), then, at the Issuer’s option, all, but not less than all, of the Notes may be redeemed at any time on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Amounts due thereon up to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that (1) no notice of redemption for tax reasons may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the relevant Payor would be obligated to pay these Additional Amounts if a payment on the Notes were then due, and (2) at the time such notice of redemption is given such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect.

 This notice, once delivered by the Issuer to the Holders, will be irrevocable subject to any conditions precedent set forth in such notice.

 Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this provision, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

 • an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect the redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to redeem have occurred; and

 • an Opinion of Counsel from counsel in the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (which may be the Issuer’s counsel) stating that no later than the next succeeding date on which any amount is to be paid, the relevant Payor has or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of such amendment or change.

 The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on any Officer’s Certificate and/or Opinion of Counsel delivered to it pursuant to the provisions of the above paragraph without further enquiry or liability, following which such documents, shall become binding on the Trustee and the Holders.

 Optional Redemption Procedures. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Registrar will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, subject to the following sentence (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,’’ in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream), unless otherwise required by law or applicable

 64


-----

###### stock exchange or depositary requirements. No Notes of a principal amount of A100,000 or less may be redeemed in part and Notes of a principal amount in excess of A100,000 may be redeemed in part in multiples of A1,000 only.

 Notice of any optional redemption will be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid or otherwise given in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, at least ten, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed (with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent). For so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will also cause notices of redemption to be published as described under ‘‘—Notices’’ below. If the Notes are to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof (if any) will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note (or appropriate adjustments to the amount and beneficial interests in the Global Note will be made, as appropriate).

 The Issuer will pay the redemption price for the Notes together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption as long as the Issuer has deposited with the Paying Agent funds in satisfaction of the applicable redemption price pursuant to the Conditions.

 In connection with any redemption of the Notes (including with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Event), any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including any related Equity Event. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. If any such redemption is delayed or terminated, the Issuer will provide prompt written notice of such delay or termination to the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and the Holders.

 In the event that Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw their Notes in a Change of Control Offer, Asset Sale Offer or other tender offer and the Issuer (or a third party making the offer as described above) purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and, accordingly, the Issuer or third party offeror, as applicable, will have the right, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice with delivery electronically or by first class mail, postage prepaid, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the registered address of such Holder (or otherwise given in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream), to redeem (in the case of the Issuer) or purchase (in the case of a third party offeror) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price or purchase price, as the case may be, equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such offer (which may be less than par) plus, to the extent not included in such price, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

 Mandatory Redemption; Open Market Purchases

 Mandatory Redemption upon the Fixed Link Sale. If a Fixed Link Sale is consummated in accordance with the covenant under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales’’, then the Issuer shall, upon the receipt of the cash proceeds of such Fixed Link Sale, redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Amounts due thereon up to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), provided that any Net Cash Proceeds of such Fixed Link Sale shall be first applied by the Group to repay any principal outstanding, pay any interest accrued but unpaid and pay any additional amounts due under the Fixed Link Debt in accordance with its terms.

 Mandatory Redemption Procedures. Notice of any mandatory redemption will be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid or otherwise given in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, at least 10, but not more than 60 days (or longer than 60 days in the case of a discharge), before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes (with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent). For so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of

-----

###### such exchange so require, the Issuer will also cause such notice of redemption to be published as described under ‘‘—Notices’’ below. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes as long as the Issuer has deposited with the Paying Agent funds in satisfaction of the applicable redemption price pursuant to the Conditions.

 Other than as discussed in this ‘‘—Mandatory Redemption; Open Market Purchases’’, the Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under the captions ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales’’.

 The Issuer and/or any of its Subsidiaries may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offers, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Conditions.

 Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder will have the right to require that the Issuer purchase all or a portion (in integral multiples of A1,000; provided, that the remaining principal amount of such Holder’s Note will not be less than A100,000) of the Holder’s Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment’’).

 Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurred, the Issuer must send, electronically or by first-class mail or otherwise in accordance with the Conditions and applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent, offering to purchase the Notes as described above (a ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’). The Change of Control Offer shall state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than ten days nor later than 60 days from the date the notice is mailed, except as may be required by law, and in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’). If and for so long as the Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date, on the official website of such exchange.

 On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

 (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

 (2) deposit with the Paying Agent funds in an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not withdrawn; and

 (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Registrar the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer.

 If only a portion of a Note is purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, a new Note in a principal amount equal to the portion thereof not purchased will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note (or appropriate adjustments to the amount and beneficial interests in the Global Note will be made, as appropriate); provided, that the remaining principal amount of such Holder’s Note will not be less than A100,000 and will be in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

 The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in a manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Conditions applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption for all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Conditions as described under the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, or conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. If a Change of Control Offer is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of

 66


-----

###### Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event, such Change of Control Offer shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any such condition shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any such condition shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, provided, that the purchase date shall be no earlier than 15 days from the date notice is mailed.

 The agreements governing the Issuer’s other Indebtedness contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event, and such agreements contain or may contain provisions prohibiting repurchases of, or other prepayments in respect of, other Indebtedness, including the Notes, following a Change of Control Triggering Event. The exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. In the event a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Conditions which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Group’s Debt Profile, Structure and the Notes—The Group may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control’’.

 If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, the Issuer may not have available funds sufficient to make the Change of Control Payment for all Notes that might be delivered by Holders seeking to accept a Change of Control Offer. In the event the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer expects that it would seek third-party financing to the extent it does not have available funds to meet its purchase obligations. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain necessary financing.

 The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Conditions or the Trust Deed are applicable. Holders will not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization, leveraged buyout or similar transaction which is not a Change of Control.

 The Issuer will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the ‘‘Change of Control’’ provisions of the Conditions, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Notes or the Trust Deed by doing so. If it would be unlawful in any jurisdiction to make a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will not be obligated to make such offer in such jurisdiction and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Notes or the Trust Deed by doing so.

 The obligation of the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified at any time prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event with the written consent of Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

-----

###### (4) For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of, any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with this covenant:

 (a) the outstanding principal amount of any item of Indebtedness will be counted only once (without duplication for guarantees or otherwise);

 (c) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS. Accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of regularly scheduled interest in the form of additional Indebtedness of the same instrument or the payment of regularly scheduled dividends on Disqualified Capital Stock in the form of additional Disqualified Capital Stock with the same terms will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant; provided that any such outstanding additional Indebtedness or Disqualified Capital Stock paid in respect of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any provision of paragraph (2) of this covenant will be counted as Indebtedness outstanding thereunder for purposes of any future Incurrence under such provision.

 Limitation on Restricted Payments

 The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions (each, a ‘‘Restricted Payment’’):

 (a) declare, make or pay any dividend, charge, fee or other distribution (or interest on any unpaid dividend, charge fee or other distribution) (whether in cash or in kind) on or in respect of its share capital (or any class of its share capital), other than:

 • dividends or distributions payable in Qualified Capital Stock of the Issuer;

 • dividends, distributions, returns of capital or other payments payable to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

 • dividends, distributions or returns of capital made on at least a pro rata basis to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other holders of Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary, on the other hand (or on a less than pro rata basis to any minority holder);

 (b) repay or distribute any share premium reserve, in each case, with respect to the Issuer;

 (c) redeem, repurchase, defease, retire or repay any of the Issuer’s share capital or resolve to do so, other that in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Capital Stock); or

 (d) make any Investment in any Unrestricted Subsidiary.

 Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, this covenant shall not prohibit:

 (1) any Restricted Payment, provided that:

 (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of, and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing after giving effect to such Restricted Payment;

 (ii) as at the Testing Date immediately preceding the date on which the Restricted Payment is proposed to be made, the Debt Service Cover Ratio on a look back rolling last twelve month basis was equal to, or in excess of, 1.25 to 1.0; and

 (iii) on the date on which the Restricted Payment is proposed to be made, the Debt Service Reserve Account contains at least the Minimum DSRA Amount; and

 (2) any distribution in any form whatsoever of the proceeds of any Europorte Sale.

 The amount of any Restricted Payments not in cash will be the Fair Market Value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the property, assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment.

-----

###### Limitation on Asset Sales

 The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

 (a) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (measured as at the date of the definitive agreement with respect to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of, and

 (b) at least 75% of the consideration received for the assets sold by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the Asset Sale shall be in the form of (1) cash or Cash Equivalents, (2) assets (other than current assets as determined in accordance with IFRS or Capital Stock) to be used by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Business, (3) Capital Stock in a Person engaged primarily in a Permitted Business that will become a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale or (4) a combination of cash, Cash Equivalents and such assets.

 The Issuer and one or more Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, may apply within 365 days of any Asset Sale an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from any such Asset Sale to:

 (a) repay any Priority Credit Liabilities of the Issuer or any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary for borrowed money (including any such Indebtedness represented by bonds, notes, debentures or other similar instruments) or constituting a Capitalized Lease Obligation (in each case, including any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof); or

 (b) purchase:

 (1) assets (other than current assets as determined in accordance with IFRS or Capital Stock) to be used by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Business; or

 (2) Capital Stock of a Person engaged in a Permitted Business that will become, upon purchase, a Restricted Subsidiary; from a Person other than the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

 (c) make Capital Expenditures; or

 (d) repurchase, prepay, redeem or repay (1) Pari Passu liabilities; provided that a pro rata portion of such amount of cash is at the Issuer’s option, (i) applied to redeem Notes as described under the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’, purchase the Notes through open market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or (ii) offered to purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase, which offer will constitute an application of Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to this clause to the extent of the amount of the offer, whether or not any Notes are tendered; or (2) any CLEF Financing;

 provided that if during such 365-day period the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into a definitive binding agreement committing it to apply such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with the requirements of clause (b) or (c) after such 365-day period, such 365-day period will be extended with respect to the amount of Net Cash Proceeds so committed, for a period not to exceed 180 days until such Net Cash Proceeds are required to be applied in accordance with such agreement (or, if earlier, until termination of such agreement).

 Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Conditions and the Trust Deed.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Asset Sale is the result of an involuntary expropriation, nationalization, taking or similar action by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority, such Asset Sale need not comply with clauses (a) and (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant. In addition, the proceeds of any such Asset Sale shall not be deemed to have been received (and the 365-day period in which to apply any Net Cash Proceeds shall not begin to run) until the proceeds to be paid by or on behalf of the Governmental Authority have been paid in cash to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary making such Asset Sale and if any litigation, arbitration or other action is brought contesting the validity of or any other matter relating to any such expropriation, nationalization, taking or other similar action, including the amount of the compensation to be paid in respect thereof, until such litigation, arbitration or other action is finally settled or a final judgment or award has been entered and any such judgment or award has been collected in full.

 71


-----

###### For the purpose of this covenant and for no other purpose, the following are deemed to be Cash Equivalents:

 (a) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee to the extent, and in the amount, that they are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days of the closing of the Asset Sale;

 (b) the amount (without duplication) of liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s, or such Restricted Subsidiary’s, most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are expressly assumed by the transferee (or a third party on behalf of the transferee) of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) and for which the Issuer and all Subsidiaries have been released by all creditors;

 (c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries), to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

 (d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from persons that are not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

 (e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (e) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) A90.0 million and (y) 16.8% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

 To the extent there are any remaining Net Cash Proceeds (‘‘Excess Proceeds’’) that have not been applied as described in clause (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the fifth preceding paragraph within 365 days after the Asset Sale, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase Notes (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’), at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the ‘‘Asset Sale Offer Amount’’). The Issuer will purchase pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer from all tendering Holders on a pro rata basis (subject to maintaining the authorized denominations for the Notes), and, at the Issuer’s option, on a pro rata basis with the Holders of any other Senior Indebtedness with similar provisions requiring the Issuer to offer to purchase the other Senior Indebtedness with the proceeds of Asset Sales, that principal amount (or accreted value in the case of Indebtedness issued with original issue discount) of Notes and the other Senior Indebtedness to be purchased equal to such Excess Proceeds. The Issuer may satisfy its obligations under this covenant with respect to the Excess Proceeds of an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 365-day period.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may defer an Asset Sale Offer until there is an aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds from one or more Asset Sales in excess of A50.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies). At that time, the amount of Excess Proceeds in excess of A50.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies) will be applied as required pursuant to this covenant.

 Each notice of an Asset Sale Offer will be provided to the Holders within 30 days following such 365th day (or such later date as permitted under this covenant), with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent offering to purchase Notes as described above. Each notice of an Asset Sale Offer will state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date the notice is mailed or otherwise given in accordance with the Conditions, other than as may be required by law (the ‘‘Asset Sale Offer Payment Date’’). Upon receiving notice of an Asset Sale Offer, Holders may elect to tender their Notes in whole or in part in integral multiples of A1,000 in exchange for cash; provided that the principal amount of such tendering Holder’s Note shall not be less than A100,000.

 72


-----

###### On the Asset Sale Offer Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

 (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer;

 (2) deposit with the Paying Agent funds in an amount equal to the Asset Sale Offer Amount in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not withdrawn; and

 (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Registrar Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer.

 To the extent Holders of Notes and holders of other Senior Indebtedness, if any, which are the subject of an Asset Sale Offer properly tender and do not withdraw Notes or the other Senior Indebtedness in an aggregate amount exceeding the amount of the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer will purchase Notes and the other Senior Indebtedness on a pro rata basis (based on amounts tendered and subject to maintaining the authorized denominations for the Notes) as set forth above. If only a portion of a Note is purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer, a new Note in a principal amount equal to the portion thereof not purchased will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note (or appropriate adjustments to the amount and beneficial interests in the Global Note will be made, as appropriate).

 The Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions in the Conditions, the Issuer will comply with these laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions in the Conditions by doing so. If it would be unlawful in any jurisdiction to make an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer will not be obligated to make such offer in such jurisdiction and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Notes and the Trust Deed by doing so.

 The agreements governing the Issuer’s other Indebtedness contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute an Asset Sale and including repurchases of, or other prepayments in respect of, the Notes. The exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Conditions which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources.

 To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Senior Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is lower than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Conditions. Upon completion of an Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. Accordingly, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any Excess Proceeds in any manner not otherwise prohibited by the Conditions or the Trust Deed.

 Limitation on Fixed Link Sale

 The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate any Fixed Link Sale, unless required by law or any Governmental Authority.

 If a Fixed Link Sale is consummated in accordance with the requirements of law or any Governmental Authority, the Net Cash Proceeds of such Fixed Link Sale shall be applied by the Issuer to first, repay any principal, and any other amounts, outstanding under any Fixed Link Debt in accordance with its terms and, second, in accordance with ‘‘Mandatory Redemption; Open Market Purchases’’.

 73


-----

###### Limitation on Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries

 The Issuer may designate after the Issue Date any Subsidiary of the Issuer as an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ under the Conditions (a ‘‘Designation’’) only if:

 (1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of, and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing after giving effect to, such Designation;

 (2) immediately after giving effect to such Designation, the Issuer will be able to Incur at least A1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness’’; and

 (3) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of Designation (assuming the effectiveness of such Designation and treating such Designation as an Investment at the time of Designation) as a Restricted Payment pursuant to ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ in an amount equal to the amount of the Issuer’s Investment in such Subsidiary on such date (as determined in accordance with the second paragraph of the definition of ‘‘Investment’’).

 The Issuer may revoke any Designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (a ‘‘Revocation’’) only if:

 (1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of, and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, after giving effect to such Revocation;

 (2) all Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary outstanding immediately following such Revocation would, if Incurred at such time, be permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Conditions; and

 (3) all Liens upon the property or assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary existing immediately following such Revocation would, if Incurred at such time, be permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Conditions.

 In addition, if an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that Designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness owed to such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such Designation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness’’, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such Designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period.

 The Designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to include the Designation of all of the Subsidiaries of such Subsidiary. The Designation of any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary may be revoked at any time. All Designations and Revocations must be evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, delivered to the Trustee (who shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate without further enquiry or liability) certifying compliance with the preceding provisions.

 Limitation on Liens

 The Issuer will not Incur any Liens of any kind against or upon any of its properties or assets whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after the Issue Date, or any proceeds therefrom, to secure any Indebtedness, unless (a) in the case of a Lien on assets other than the Security, (i) such Lien is a Permitted Lien or (ii) contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Notes and all other amounts due under the Conditions, in each case, equally and ratably with such Indebtedness or other obligation (or, in the event that such Indebtedness is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, as the case may be, senior in priority to such Indebtedness or other obligation) with a Lien on the same properties and assets securing such Indebtedness or other obligation for so long as such Indebtedness or other obligation is secured by such Lien; or (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Security, such Lien is a Permitted Security Lien.

 Limitation on Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets

 The Issuer will not, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving or continuing Person), or sell, assign, transfer,

 74


-----

###### lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer (determined on a consolidated basis for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), to any Person unless:

 (a) either:

 (1) the Issuer shall be the surviving or continuing corporation; or

 (2) the Person (if other than the Issuer) formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition the properties and assets of the Issuer and of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries substantially as an entirety (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’):

 (A) shall be an entity organized or incorporated, as applicable, and validly existing under the laws of (i) France; (ii) England and Wales or (iii) any other country which is a member country of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, and, if such entity is not a corporation, there shall be a co-obligor of the Notes that is a corporation organized or existing under any such laws; and

 (B) shall expressly assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Trust Deed and the Security Documents, pursuant to a supplemental trust deed and any other required security documents;

 (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the assumption contemplated by clause (a)(2)(B) above (including giving effect on a pro forma basis to any Indebtedness, including any Acquired Indebtedness, Incurred or anticipated to be Incurred in connection with or in respect of such transaction), either (x) the Issuer or such Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will be able to Incur at least A1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness’’ or (y) the Total Net Leverage Ratio will be equal to or less and the Debt Service Cover Ratio will be equal to or greater than immediately prior to such transaction;

 (c) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the assumption contemplated by clause (a)(2)(B) above (including, without limitation, giving effect on a pro forma basis to any Indebtedness, including any Acquired Indebtedness, Incurred or anticipated to be Incurred and any Lien granted in connection with or in respect of the transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing; and

 (b) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such transaction and such supplemental trust deed, if any, comply with the Trust Deed.

 The Trust Deed contains provisions permitting the Trustee (if it is satisfied that to do so would not be materially prejudicial to the interests of Holders) to agree, if requested by the Issuer and subject to such amendment of the Trust Deed, but without the consent of Holders, to the substitution of any other company in place of the Issuer, or of any previous substituted company, as principal debtor under the Trust Deed and the Notes, subject to the Notes remaining subject to security that is equivalent or substantially equivalent to the Security as provided in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’.

 Upon any consolidation, combination or merger or any transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer in accordance with this covenant, in which the Issuer is not the continuing Person, the Surviving Entity formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer is merged or to which such conveyance, lease or transfer is made will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Trust Deed and the Notes, with the same effect as if such Surviving Entity had been named as such. For the avoidance of doubt, compliance with this covenant will not affect the obligations of the Issuer (including a Surviving Entity, if applicable) under ‘‘—Change of Control’’, if applicable.

 Conduct of Business

 The Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not engage in any business other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 Maintenance of Listing

 The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, for so long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time

 75


-----

###### the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of the Notes on another recognised listing exchange for high yield issuers.

 Debt Service Reserve Account

 The Issuer has opened an account (the ‘‘Debt Service Reserve Account’’) with BNP Paribas in London and, on or before the Issue Date, shall procure that:

 (a) an amount of cash is transferred to the Debt Service Reserve Account, which is an amount not less than the Minimum DSRA Amount;

 (b) withdrawals from the Debt Service Reserve Account are only used for the purpose of paying amounts up to, and including, principal and interest on the Notes and any other amounts payable by the Issuer in accordance the Conditions after using all other amounts available to the Issuer; and

 (c) first ranking security is granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes over the Debt Service Reserve Account in a form acceptable to the Security Agent, acting reasonably in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Further Assurances

 Subject to the limitations set forth in the Security Documents, the Conditions will provide that the Issuer will execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further action that may be required under applicable law, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests and Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Security.

 Impairment of Security Interest in Security

 The Issuer shall not take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action that would have the result of materially impairing any security interest with respect to the Security (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Liens as described under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair any security interest with respect to the Security) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Security, except that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any of the Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring Liens permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’, (ii) the Issuer may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Document for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Security may be discharged and released in accordance with the Conditions, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv)(a) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (b) the security interests in the Security may be amended in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect, in each case, in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (iv)(b) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iv)(b) above, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any relevant action with respect to Security Documents to which the Issuer is party as a security grantor, confirming the solvency of the Issuer), after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) an Officer’s Certificate, in a form satisfactory to the Security Agent, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such security interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the applicable Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new

###### hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, subject to the terms of the Trust Deed and the Security Document, consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions from any Holder.

 Reports to Holders

 So long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders of the Notes and to the Trustee:

 (1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ended 31 December 2018), annual reports, which shall contain the following information with a level of detail that is substantially comparable to Annex A of this Offering Memorandum: (i) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as at the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (iii) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material new contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments (unless such contractual arrangements were described in a previous annual or semi-annual report, in which case the Issuer need to describe only any material changes); and (iv) material risk factors relating to the business of the Issuer and material recent developments;

 (2) within 90 days following the end of each semi-annual period in each fiscal year of the Issuer (beginning with the half-year ending June 30, 2019), semi-annual reports containing the following information: (i) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of such period and unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flow of the Issuer for the semi-annual period ending on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet date and the comparable prior year period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of changes in material commitments and contingencies and changes in critical accounting policies; and (iii) material recent developments; and

 The Issuer will provide to the Trustee such other information that it is required to make publicly available under the requirements of the Relevant Exchange as a result of having its ordinary shares admitted for trading on any such exchange. Notwithstanding clauses (1) through (3) of the preceding paragraph of this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant, upon the Issuer complying with the public reporting requirements (including applicable timing requirements) of the Relevant Exchange (regardless of whether the Issuer’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on such exchange), provided that such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the Relevant Exchange, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in clauses (1) through (3) of the preceding paragraph of this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant.

 If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted Subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, would otherwise have been a Significant Subsidiary, then the annual and semi-annual financial information required by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, as determined in good faith by senior management of the Issuer, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes to the financial statements and in the ‘‘Results and Outlook’’ section of the document attached as Annex A of this Offering Memorandum or its equivalent, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its

###### Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

 All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the Conditions) shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect, including, to the extent adopted at such time, the application of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor standard thereto, on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum.

 So long as any Notes remain outstanding, no later than 20 Business Days after the delivery of the annual and semi-annual reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant, the Issuer shall hold a live conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period for the benefit of Holders or prospective holders of Notes (or provide Holders of the Notes with access to any public conference call, investor presentation, webcast or other event, the primary purpose of which is to discuss such reports and the results of operations); provided that no more than one conference call will be required in relation to any annual and semi-annual period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such call or presentation shall be required if the Group does not conduct such a call or presentation in connection with the listing of its Capital Stock on any Relevant Exchange.

 Covenant Fall Away

 If (i) a Rating Release Event has occurred and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then, beginning on that day, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be released from their respective obligations under the provisions of this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ described under the following covenants ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness’’, ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’, and ‘‘—Limitation on Asset Sales’’ and such provisions shall be terminated and permanently cease to have effect with respect to the Notes. The Issuer shall promptly give notice to the Trustee and provide the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate stating that the conditions set forth in this paragraph have been satisfied; provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the termination of the covenants described under this caption to be effective.

 Events of Default

 The following are ‘‘Events of Default’’:

 (1) default in the payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes, including the failure to make a required payment to purchase the Notes tendered pursuant to an optional redemption, Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer;

 (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts on the Notes;

 (3) the failure to perform or comply with any of the provisions described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets;’’

 (4) the failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any other covenant or agreement contained in the Conditions or the Trust Deed for 60 days or more after written notice to the Issuer from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes (in the case of a notice by the Holders, with a copy to the Trustee);

 (5) default by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which shall not have been cured or waived under any Indebtedness (including Indebtedness under any Credit Facility) which:

 (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default; or

 (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity;

 78


-----

###### provided that (i) the principal or accreted amount of Indebtedness covered by (a) or (b) at the relevant time, exceeds (x) in the case of the Issuer, A25.0 million individually or in the aggregate (or the equivalent in other currencies) or (x) in the case of Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, A75.0 million individually or in the aggregate (or the equivalent in other currencies) or (ii) such Indebtedness is the Fixed Link Debt, and provided further that nothing in clauses (a) or (b) above shall constitute an Event of Default in respect of any Indebtedness during such time as a ‘‘conciliation process’’ is in progress in relation to the relevant member of Issuer’s Group under applicable French law;

 (6) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay one or more final judgments against any of them, aggregating (i) in the case of the Issuer, A25.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies) or more or (ii) in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, A75.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies) or more, which judgment(s), in each case, are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days or more;

 (7) (i) any security interest created by the Security Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (except as permitted by the terms of the Conditions or the Security Documents) with respect to Security having a Fair Market Value in excess of (i) A25.0 million, in the case of Security held by the Issuer or (ii) A75.0 million, in the case of Security held by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, or an assertion by the Issuer that any Security having a Fair Market Value in excess of (i) A25.0 million, in the case of Security held by the Issuer or (ii) A75.0 million, in the case of Security held by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer is not subject to a valid, perfected security interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Conditions or the Security Documents); (ii) the repudiation by the Issuer of any of its material obligations under the Security Documents; or (iii) any material representation or warranty made by the Issuer in any Security Document proves to have been false or misleading in any material respect as at the time made, and the fact, event or circumstance that gave rise to the misrepresentation has resulted, or is reasonably likely to result in, a material adverse effect and such misrepresentation or material adverse effect continues uncured for 30 or more days from the date a responsible officer of the Issuer obtains knowledge thereof; and

 (8) certain events of bankruptcy described in the Conditions affecting the Issuer, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are Significant Subsidiaries or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

 It shall not be an Event of Default in the case of any default by a Restricted Subsidiary described under clause (5), (6) or (8) above if at the time of such default the Debt Service Cover Ratio, after excluding Debt Service and Net Cash Flow for any such defaulting Restricted Subsidiary, is at least 1.25 to 1.0. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (8) above) shall occur and be continuing and has not been cured or waived, the Trustee may or, if instructed by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding Notes, shall (subject in all cases to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) declare the unpaid principal of (and premium, if any) and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable by notice in writing to the Issuer, specifying the Event of Default and that it is a ‘‘notice of acceleration’’. If an Event of Default specified in clause (8) above occurs, then the unpaid principal of (and premium, if any) and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

 In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default that triggered such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of declaration of acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes as described in the preceding paragraph the Trustee (if so instructed by, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes) may rescind and cancel such declaration and its consequences by written notice to the Issuer

 (1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree;

 (2) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived, except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration; and

 79


-----

###### (3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid.

 No rescission will affect any subsequent Default or impair any rights relating thereto.

 The Trustee (acting on the directions of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Notes) may waive any existing Default or Event of Default under this ‘‘Description of Notes’’, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.

 Subject to all provisions of the Trust Deed, the Conditions and applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or directing the Trustee to exercise its rights or powers conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Trust Deed at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee.

 The Trustee may at its discretion and without further notice, institute such proceedings as it thinks fit to enforce its rights under the Trust Deed in respect of the Notes, this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ and the Trust Deed, but it shall not be bound to do so, unless so requested in writing by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and in any such case, only if it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities to which it may thereby become liable for which it may incur by so doing.

 No Holder of Notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Trust Deed or for any remedy thereunder, unless:

 (1) such Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

 (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee;

 (3) such Holders of Notes provide to the Trustee satisfactory indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding;

 (4) the Trustee fails to comply within a reasonable period after receipt of such notice and offer of indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding (as applicable) and such failure is continuing; and

 Notwithstanding any other term of this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ or the Conditions, no Permitted Reorganization shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any undertaking or other term in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ or a Default or an Event of Default, and shall be expressly permitted under the terms of this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ or the Conditions.

 The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Trust Deed. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

 The Trust Deed will provide that (i) if a Default for failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with an another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at that time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action; and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time period prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘—Reports to Holders’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Trust Deed shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the preserved period specified in the Trust Deed.

###### Limited Condition Acquisition

 With respect to any acquisition or similar Investment for which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may not terminate its obligations due to a lack of financing for such acquisition or similar Investment (whether by merger, consolidation or other business combination or the acquisition of Capital Stock or otherwise) as applicable, for purposes of determining:

 (1) whether any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is being incurred in connection with such acquisition or similar Investment is permitted to be incurred in compliance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness’’;

 (2) whether any Lien being incurred in connection with such acquisition or similar Investment or to secure any such Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred in accordance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’ or the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’;

 (3) whether such acquisition or similar Investment or any other transaction undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such acquisition or similar Investment or repayment complies with the covenants or agreements contained in the Trust Deed or the Notes; and

 (4) any calculation of the Debt Service, Net Cash Flow, Debt Service Cover Ratio, Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Debt and/or Consolidated EBITDA and, whether a Default or Event of Default exists in connection with the foregoing, at the option of the Issuer, the date that the definitive agreement for such acquisition or similar Investment is entered into (the ‘‘Transaction Agreement Date’’) may be used as the applicable date of determination, as the case may be, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of ‘‘Debt Service Cover Ratio’’ or ‘‘Total Net Leverage Ratio’’. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer elects to use the Transaction Agreement Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, (a) any fluctuation or change in the Debt Service, Net Cash Flow, Debt Service Cover Ratio, Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Debt and/or Consolidated EBITDA and/or any component definition of any of the foregoing of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, the target business or assets to be acquired subsequent to the Transaction Agreement Date and at or prior to the consummation of such acquisition or similar Investment, will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether any Indebtedness or Lien that is being incurred in connection with such acquisition or similar Investment is permitted to be incurred or in connection with compliance by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with any other provision of the Trust Deed or the Notes or any other transaction undertaken in connection with such acquisition or similar Investment and (b) until such acquisition or similar Investment is consummated or such definitive agreements are terminated, such acquisition or similar Investment and all transactions proposed to be undertaken in connection therewith (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens) will be given pro forma effect when determining compliance of other transactions (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens unrelated to such acquisition or similar Investment) that are consummated after the Transaction Agreement Date and on or prior to the consummation of such acquisition or similar Investment and any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) will be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Conditions after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such acquisition or similar Investment; provided that in connection with the making of Restricted Payments, the calculation of Debt Service Cover Ratio (and any component thereof) will not, in any case, assume such acquisition or similar Investment has been consummated.

 Satisfaction and Discharge

 The Trust Deed (other than those provisions which by their express terms survive) and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding Notes when:

 (1) either:

 (a) all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Registrar for cancellation; or

 81


-----

###### (b) (i) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Registrar for cancellation have become due and payable or will become due and payable at the stated date for payment thereof within one year or will be called for redemption within one year or (ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Registrar for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise, and, in each case, the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) funds which shall be held on deposit in euros sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on Notes not theretofore delivered to the Registrar for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Notes to the date of deposit, together with an irrevocable request from the Issuer to the Trustee (or the other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) to apply such funds to the payment;

 (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of the deposit pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings), and the deposit shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Trust Deed) to which the Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound;

###### BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM

 General

 The Notes will be represented on issue by a global note certificate in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Global Notes’’).

 The Global Notes will be deposited with and registered in the name of a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

 While the Notes are in global form, holders of beneficial interests in the Global Notes (the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will not be considered the owners or ‘‘Holders’’ of Notes for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the Holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Trust Deed. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of Holders under the Trust Deed. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

 Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants. Investors may hold notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organisations that are participants in such systems.

 The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream as applicable, or to a successor of Euroclear or Clearstream as applicable, or their nominees. Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated form (‘‘Certificated Notes’’) except in the limited circumstances described below. Please see ‘‘—Exchange of the Global Notes for Certificated Notes’’. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.

 Payments on the Global Notes

 Payment of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, interest and premium, if any) will be made by the Issuer in Euros to the Principal Paying Agent. The Principal Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

 Under the terms of the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement, the Issuer, the Paying Agents, Registrar and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Paying Agents, Registrar and Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

 • any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participants, or for maintaining supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

 • any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant. Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through

 106


-----

###### participants are the responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in ‘‘street name’’.

 Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests

 Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Notes, and to distribute such Certificated Notes to their respective participants.

 Exchange of the Global Notes for Certificated Notes

 The Global Notes are exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

 (1) Euroclear or Clearstream is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease business; or

 (2) any of the circumstances described in Condition 11 (Events of Default) of the terms and conditions of the Notes as appended to the Trust Deed occurs.

 Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

 All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

 Euroclear and Clearstream

 Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

 Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System

 The notes represented by the Global Notes are to be listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market.

 The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

 Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

 On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the ‘‘Commission’s Proposal’’) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the ‘‘Participating Member States’’) and Estonia. However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

 The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.

 Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ‘‘established’’ in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

 The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate or to withdraw.

 Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

 France

 This is a general summary and the tax consequences as described here may not apply to a holder of Notes. Any potential investors should consult their own tax advisers for more information about the tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Notes in their particular circumstances.

 PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS AS TO FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL OF THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

 In addition, Article 1649 AC of the French Tax Code imposes on financial institutions within the meaning of Article 1 of Decree n�2016-1683 to review and collect information on their clients and investors, in order to identify their tax residence, as well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign tax authorities (via the French tax authorities) on an annual basis.

 Payments of interest and other revenue in respect of the Notes (including those paid upon redemption of the Notes) to individuals not fiscally domiciled in France

 Payments of interest and assimilated revenue made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non coop´eratif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a ‘‘Non-Cooperative State’’), irrespective of the

 108


-----

###### holder’s residence for tax purposes or registered headquarters. Pursuant to Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, if such payments under the Notes are made in a Non-Cooperative State, a 75% mandatory withholding tax will be due (subject to certain exceptions certain of which are set forth below and to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrˆet´e), which is updated at least once a year. This list was last updated on April 8, 2016. In this respect, it should be noted that a draft law published by the French government on March 28, 2018 would, if adopted in its current form, expand the list of Non-Cooperative State as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code to include states and jurisdictions on the EU List published by the Council of the European Union on 5 December 2017, as updated, and, as consequence, would expand this withholding tax regime to the states and jurisdictions included in the EU List.

 Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and other assimilated revenue on the Notes may not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable income, if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State (the ‘‘Deductibility Exclusion’’). In this respect, it should be noted that a draft law published by the French government on 28 March 2018 above-mentioned would, if adopted in its current form, expand this regime to the states and jurisdictions included in the EU List published by the Council of the European Union on 5 December 2017, as updated. Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and other revenue may be re-characterised as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case such non-deductible interest and other assimilated revenue may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code at a rate of (i) 75% if they are paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in a Non-Cooperative State; (ii) 30% (to be aligned on the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in Article 219-I of the French Tax Code for fiscal years beginning as from 1 January 2020) if they are paid to corporate or other legal entities who are not French tax residents; or (iii) 12.8% for payments made to individuals who are not French tax residents, (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty).

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code nor, to the extent the relevant interest relate to genuine transactions and is not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion (and therefore the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of the Deductibility Exclusion), will apply in respect of a particular issue of Notes, if the Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of such issue of the Notes were not to enable payments of interest or other similar revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the ‘‘Exception’’).

 However, pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impˆots (French administrative guidelines) referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211 n�550 and n�990, BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40-20140211 n�70 and n�80 and BOI-IR-DOMIC-10-20-20-60-20150320 n�10 (the ‘‘Administrative Guidelines’’), an issue of notes will benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any proof of the main purpose and effect of such issue of Notes, and accordingly will be able to benefit from the Exception (the ‘‘Safe Harbor’’), if such Notes are:

 (i) offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code mon´etaire et financier) or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State which is not a Non-Cooperative State. For this purpose, an ‘‘equivalent offer’’ means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or

 (ii) admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

 (iii) admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

 The Notes issued under this Offering Memorandum qualify as debt securities under French commercial law. Considering that: (i) as at the date of their admission to trading, the Notes will be admitted to trading

 109


-----

###### on the Official List of the Exchange which does not qualify as a Non-Cooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and/or (ii) the Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments of interest and other assimilated revenue in respect of the Notes made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will fall under the Safe Harbor.

 Accordingly, such payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will benefit from the Exception. Moreover, under the same conditions since the relevant interest and other assimilated revenue should be considered as relating to genuine transactions and not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and other assimilated revenue in respect of the Notes paid by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will be subject, pursuant to the Administrative Guidelines, neither to the Deductibility Exclusion nor to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid or accrued to a person domiciled or established in a Non Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State.

 Accordingly, such payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will benefit from the Exception. Moreover, under the same conditions, since the relevant interest and other assimilated revenue should be considered as relating to genuine transactions and not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and other assimilated revenue in respect of the Notes paid by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will be subject, pursuant to the Administrative Guidelines, neither to the Deductibility Exclusion nor to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid or accrued to a person domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State.

 Payments of interest and other revenue in respect of the Notes (including those paid upon redemption of the notes) to individuals fiscally domiciled in France

 Pursuant to Article 125 A of the French Code g´en´eral des impˆots, where the paying agent (´etablissement payeur) is established in France and subject to certain limited exceptions, interest and other similar income received by individuals fiscally domiciled (domicili´es fiscalement) in France are subject to a 12.8% mandatory withholding tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied by way of withholding tax at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on interest and similar income paid to individuals fiscally domiciled (domicili´es fiscalement) in France. Practical steps to be taken for the purposes of levying this withholding tax and social contributions will depend on the place where the paying agent is located.

 Prospective purchasers of Notes who are French resident for tax purposes or who would hold such Notes through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France should be aware that transactions involving the Notes, including any purchase or disposal of, or other dealings in, the Notes, may have French tax consequences. The tax consequences regarding interest, premium on redemption and capital gains may depend, amongst other things, upon the status of the prospective purchaser (i.e legal entities or individuals). Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers about the French tax implications of purchasing, holding, disposing the Notes and more generally of any transactions involving Notes.

 Sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes

 Pursuant to Article 244 bis C of the French Tax Code, a holder of Notes who is not a resident of France for French tax purposes and who does not hold his Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in France, will not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains realised on the sale, exchange or other disposal of Notes.

 Pursuant to Article 150-0 A of the French Tax Code, an individual holding Notes and fiscally domiciled in France will be subject to a 12.8% mandatory withholding tax in respect of the gains realised on the sale, exchange or other disposal of Notes, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on gains realised on the sale, exchange or other disposal of Notes to individuals fiscally domiciled in France.

 In addition, no stamp or registration fee or duty or similar transfer taxes will be payable in France in connection with the sale, disposal or redemption of Notes, except in the case of filing with the French tax authorities on a voluntary basis, or to the extent that the FTT would become applicable. See ‘‘Tax Considerations—European Union: the Proposed Financial Transaction Tax (‘‘FTT’’)’’.

###### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

 The following is a summary of certain insolvency and other legal considerations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer is incorporated. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the Notes. In addition, the laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect of certain matters and laws in multiple jurisdictions could result in disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, which could adversely affect your rights and your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to all such limitations and considerations.

 European Union

 The Issuer and certain other Group companies are currently organised under the laws of member states of the European Union. There is European Union legislation governing where insolvency proceedings in respect of those companies (other than those who have their ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (‘‘COMI’’), as explained further below, in Denmark) may be opened.

 Main Insolvency proceedings

 Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’), in the case of a company or legal person, the COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Pursuant to Preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the presumption of the COMI being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in a EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and the centre of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the COMI, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, ‘‘establishment’’ means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.

 The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

 Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

 Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies

 The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency officeholders appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency officeholder appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of those proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to such proceedings and does not entail any conflict of interest. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party to act on their instructions, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

 111


-----

###### Applicability of the EU Insolvency Regulation outside of the European Union

 The EU Insolvency Regulation does not affect the jurisdiction of courts outside the European Union (or the court of Denmark) to open insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer incorporated in a EU member state in accordance with their local insolvency laws. Accordingly, in the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organised or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

 France

 Insolvency

 To the extent that the registered office of the Issuer (and other companies of the Group as the case may be) is in France, they could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings, i.e. mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation). In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main centre of interests within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, or they have an establishment in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee or sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee), judicial reorganisation proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

 Specialised courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) A20 million in turnover and 250 employees or (y) A40 million in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or, (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, debtors having their main centre of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialised courts.

 In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above, and to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group.

 In general, French insolvency legislation favours the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and corresponding security interests in the Security.

 Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganisation and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France would be subject to French main insolvency proceedings and any company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings. The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes.

 Grace periods

 In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

 Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is

 112


-----

###### thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

 If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see ‘‘—Court-assisted Proceedings’’ below).

 Insolvency test

 Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en ´etat de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay its due debts with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

 The date of insolvency (´etat de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling commencing the judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be set at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see below).

 Court-assisted Proceedings

 A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g. an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness.

 Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’ above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see ‘‘—Grace periods’’ above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it.

 Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’ above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months. The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor. Pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance

 113


-----

###### with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see ‘‘—Grace periods’’ above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings.

 Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

 The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constat´e) by the president of the Civil or Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force ex´ecutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

 Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologu´e) by the Civil or Commercial Court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above, except that in addition:

 • the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-`a-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court;

 • creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the ‘‘New Money Lien’’), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganisation proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

 • in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganisation plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate);

 • when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and

 • in the event of subsequent judicial reorganisation proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’ above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below—see ‘‘—The hardening period (p´eriode suspecte) in judicial reorganisation and judicial liquidation proceedings’’), cannot be set by the court as at a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud).

 Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire `a l’ex´ecution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:

 • interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded;

 114


-----

###### • the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained above; and

 • a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation proceedings.

 If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

 Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

 At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organise the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a ‘‘plan for the disposal of the business’’ (plan de cession) which could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganisation or liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor.

 As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

 Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

 Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard

 A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (proc´edure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’ above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an ‘‘observation period’’ (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court- appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularise to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

 115


-----

###### If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en ´etat de cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganisation proceedings.

 In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganisation proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

 • the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) (b), the court may act upon its own initiative; and

 • the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

 As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

 During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorise payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

 Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

 Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of A20 million or less.

 In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

 French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years).

 Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

 Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for equity swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers.

 Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

 116


-----

###### Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

 Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than A20 million), or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds.

 The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

 • one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favour of the debtor (the ‘‘credit institutions committee’’); and

 • the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the ‘‘major suppliers committee’’).

 If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the ‘‘bondholders general meeting’’), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

 As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or general meeting.

 The proposed plan:

 • must ‘‘take into account’’ subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings;

 • may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

 • may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

 If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable).

 Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

 The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

 Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator.

 117


-----

###### The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote.

 Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrˆet´e) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are ‘‘sufficiently protected’’ and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

 If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court- appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

 If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

 If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general bondholders meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the State prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganisation proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

 Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organisations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

 Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard

 A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (proc´edure de sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (proc´edure de sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee).

 The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to ‘‘fast-track’’ difficulties faced by large companies, i.e. those:

 • that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or

 • that publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than A3 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds A1.5 million.

 If the debtor does not exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above), the court shall authorise such constitution in the opening decision.

 118


-----

###### To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

 • the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings;

 • at any time, the Public Prosecutor may request the termination of such proceedings if the debtor has been insolvent for more than 45 days prior to the request for the commencement of conciliation proceedings;

 • the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings;

 • as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and

 • the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

 While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to ‘‘financial creditors’’ (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

 The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see ‘‘—committee-based consultation’’)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

 In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

 The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

 119


-----

###### If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process.

 The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).

 Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganisation or Liquidation Proceedings

 Judicial reorganisation (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. Within 45 days of becoming insolvent, the debtor, if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above), is required to petition for judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability in the event that judicial liquidation proceedings should be subsequently commenced against the debtor.

 Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganisation proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganisation proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the State prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganisation proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

 The objectives of judicial reorganisation proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

 As soon as judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

 In the event of judicial reorganisation proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganisation of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganisation plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganisation proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

 In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganisation plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activit´e) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

 In judicial reorganisation proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favour of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganisation plan.

 120


-----

###### If the proposed reorganisation plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganisation plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business as described below. Any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) can present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business.

 In judicial reorganisation proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labour Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the state prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganisation plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

 • appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganisation plan; or

 • order, in favour of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganisation plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

 In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

 In either of the above cases, the reorganisation plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganisation plan.

 If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

 Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

 • a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organise such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a ‘‘sale plan’’ (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; or

 • a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

 • launch auction sales (vente aux ench`eres (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

 • sell on an amicable basis (vente de gr´e `a gr´e) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorisation of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

 • request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (proc´edure des plis cachet´es). However the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

 121


-----

###### If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

 The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

 The court may also terminate the proceedings:

 • when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets;

 • in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

 The ‘‘hardening period’’ (p´eriode suspecte) in judicial reorganisation and judicial liquidation proceedings

 The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (p´eriode suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

 Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court.

 • Automatically void transactions include in particular transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarised declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (d´eclaration d’insaisissabilit´e).

 • Transactions which are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis `a tiers d´etenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

 There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

 Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganisation or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings

 Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are ‘‘contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings’’ (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n� 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed

 122


-----

###### administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a ‘‘sale plan’’ (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the ‘‘sale plan’’ (plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

 As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

 • accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded);

 • the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorised by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required for the continued operation of the business);

 • the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

 • debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/ goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed within one year of the end of the observation period;

 • creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

 • to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below);

 • to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

 • to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable—is located in another member state within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation;

 • in the context of reorganisation or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required.

 In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business.

 As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside

 123

###### metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law.

 At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above.

 In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

 If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganisation plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

 If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking.

 French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

 Creditors’ Liability

 Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard, judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, (ii) interfered with the management of the debtor or (iii) obtained security or guarantees which are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

 England and Wales

 Certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries have registered offices located in England and Wales. Assuming that their COMI is therefore in England and Wales (about which see further the section on ‘‘—European Union’’ above), any main insolvency proceedings in respect of those subsidiaries would be commenced in England and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English insolvency law.

 Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006

 The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the ‘‘Model Law Regulations’’) provide that the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency as adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 30 May 1997 has the force of law in Great Britain, subject to certain modifications.

 The Model Law Regulations apply where (i) assistance is sought in Great Britain by a foreign court or a foreign representative in connection with a foreign proceeding, or (ii) assistance is sought in a foreign state

 124


-----

###### in connection with a proceeding under British insolvency law, or (iii) a foreign proceeding and a proceeding under British insolvency law in respect of the same company are taking place concurrently or (iv) creditors or other interested parties in a foreign state have an interest in requesting the commencement of, or participating in, a proceeding under British insolvency law.

 The Model Law Regulations provide for the recognition of two types of foreign insolvency proceedings (defined to be collective judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation): (i) ‘‘foreign main proceedings’’, which can be opened in the state in which the company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (which is subject to a rebuttable presumption that the company’s registered office is the centre of the company’s main interests and it should be noted that the centre of main interests for the purposes of the Model Law Regulations may be different from the centre of main interests of an entity for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation); and (ii) ‘‘foreign non-main proceedings’’, which can be opened in the state in which the company possesses an ‘‘establishment’’ (defined as any place of operations where the company carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services).

 A foreign representative (defined to be a person or body, including one appointed on an interim basis, authorised in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganisation or the liquidation of the company’s assets or affairs or to act as a representative of the foreign proceeding) appointed in a foreign main proceeding or foreign non-main proceeding is entitled to apply to commence a proceeding under British insolvency law (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) if the conditions for commencing such a proceeding are otherwise met.

 A foreign representative may apply to the court for recognition of the foreign proceeding in which the foreign representative has been appointed. From the time of filing of such an application until the time the application is decided upon, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative and where relief is urgently needed to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors, grant relief of a provisional nature. Such relief may include staying execution against the company’s assets, entrusting the administration or realisation of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) under the law of Great Britain, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 (the ‘‘IA86’’).

 Upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities and execution against the company’s assets are stayed and the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company is suspended. Any such stay and suspension does not affect any right to take any steps to enforce security over the company’s property or of a creditor to set off its claim against a claim of the company, provided that such right would have been exercisable if the company had been made the subject of a winding-up order under the IA86.

 Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or non-main, where necessary to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation, staying the commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, staying execution against the company’s assets, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities entrusting the administration or realisation of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court, extending relief of a provisional nature previously granted and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder under the law of Great Britain, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the IA86.

 In addition, upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative has standing to make an application to the court for an order under or in connection with sections 238, 239, 244, 245 and 423 of the IA86 (see below at ‘‘—Antecedent Transaction Laws’’). For such purpose, certain time periods and notice

 125


-----

###### periods specified in such sections shall be determined by reference to the date of the opening of the foreign proceeding or the date on which a person has notice of the opening of the relevant foreign proceedings as provided in the Model Law Regulations. Where such an application is made, then those sections (together with ancillary sections of the IA86 relating thereto) shall apply whether or not the company is being wound-up or is in administration under British insolvency law.

 Note that where the Model Law Regulations conflicts with an obligation of the UK under the EU Insolvency Regulation, the requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail.

 The Insolvency Test

 The IA86 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the IA86, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

 Administration

 There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court followed by a court order for administration (the ‘in-court route’); or (ii) the filing of certain prescribed forms with the court following which the administration takes effect (the ‘out-of-court route’). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (‘‘QFC’’) (see further below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

 A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

 When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts (see ‘‘—The Insolvency test’’ above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need to consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective is not reasonably practicable and similarly for the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii) to realise property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see ‘‘—Statutory order of priorities’’ below).

 An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration. The moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed, no resolution can be passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited circumstances, no order be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the ‘‘Financial Collateral Regulations’’) (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims). Note that the Financial Collateral Regulations are secondary legislation implementing EU Directive 2002/47/EC.

 126


-----

###### An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security. The permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed charge assets, such permission will only be granted if disposing of the property in question is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and the proceeds of sale are paid to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see ‘‘—Antecedent Transaction Laws’’ below in respect of the latter).

 An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have the power to disclaim or terminate contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt—see ‘‘—Statutory order of priorities’’ below). Conversely, contractual terms providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (such as administration) will generally be enforceable as they are not considered to be against public policy as a matter of English law. However, there are exceptions to this general approach, most notably in the context of contractual supplies of services which the legislature has considered to be essential. As at 1 October 2015, counterparties may not terminate these contracts (or the supplies they govern) simply because the company enters administration, except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

 Administrative receivership—where administrative receivership is not available

 Section 72A(1) of the IA86 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s property may not appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections 72B to 72GA, none of which are relevant in the context of the Transactions. The remedy for the holder of a QFC is instead to appoint an administrator (see ‘‘—Administration’’ above).

 Administrative receivership—where the capital market exception may be relevant

 Section 72A(1) of the IA86 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s property may not appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections 72B to 72GA.

 Pursuant to section 72B of the IA86, the first exception to this general prohibition is in the context of capital markets. There are three limbs that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for this exception: (i) the appointment is in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement; (ii) a party incurs, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50 million under the arrangement; and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment.

 Each of the above three limbs is considered further below.

 Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an arrangement is a capital market arrangement if: (i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds a capital market investment issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who issues a capital market investment; or (C) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement in connection with the issue of a capital market investment; or (D) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement who agrees to provide finance to another party; or (ii) at least one party guarantees the performance of obligations of another party; or (iii) at least one party provides security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another party; or (iv) it involves an investment of a kind described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contract for differences (the ‘‘Regulated Activities Order’’).

 Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the IA86 states that a party to an arrangement includes a party to an agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the arrangement, or is necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. We note that there is no statutory definition or case law on the meaning of the term ‘‘arrangement’’, however it is clear that an arrangement can be more than just one agreement and in our view the term is apposite to describe a series of inter-related transactions.

 127


-----

###### Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, the requirement to incur debt of at least £50 million may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be expressed wholly or partly in foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at the time when the arrangement is entered into).

 Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an investment is a capital market investment if it: (i) is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or traded or designed to be rated, listed or traded.

 To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a QFC must execute a document appointing an administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document pursuant to which the QFC was created. This appointment document must then be delivered to the proposed administrative receiver and the appointment takes effect upon receipt (provided that the administrative receiver formally accepts the appointment by the end of the next business day). There is no statutory moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the appointment of an administrative receiver.

 The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the principal and interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed (the ‘‘Secured Debt’’). An administrative receiver generally has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets which derive from both the security document pursuant to which he or she was appointed and Schedule 1 of the IA86 (except insofar as this is inconsistent with the terms of that security document). In exercising such powers, an administrative receiver acts as agent of the company, unless and until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver can only dispose of assets which are subject to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is satisfied that the disposal (with or without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation of the company’s property than would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and any difference between those and the open market value are paid to the holder of that security. Further, unlike an administrator, an administrative receiver’s powers do not extend to bringing actions against the directors or former directors or (except in very limited circumstances) seeking to set aside certain transactions.

 Assets coming into the hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (as to the meaning of which see ‘‘—Statutory order of priorities’’ below).

 Liquidation/Winding-Up

 Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realised by the liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see ‘‘—Statutory order of priorities’’ below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

 There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (‘‘MVL’’) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (‘‘CVL’’).

 Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside certain transactions (see ‘‘—Antecedent Transaction Laws’’ below in respect of the latter).

 In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or contributory of the company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.

 Compulsory liquidation

 Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor or one of the other parties set out in section 124 of the IA86 (including the company itself or the directors of the company

 128


-----

###### collectively) petitions for the winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which entitle the court to make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the IA86. The most common grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts (see ‘‘—The Insolvency Test’’ above for the meaning of this term); and (ii) it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

 Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the ‘commencement of a winding up’ unless the court orders otherwise. Subject to certain exceptions, if a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced on the date on which the winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect, meaning that any of the specified transactions carried out after the presentation of a winding up petition will be void if a winding up order is subsequently made unless the company (or an interested party) has first obtained a validation order from the court.

 Members’ voluntary liquidation

 A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

 Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the majority of the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

 Creditors’ voluntary liquidation

 A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders passing a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to a MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent) and, after the shareholders’ meeting, the creditors’ must also resolve to place the company into liquidation. If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail unless any director, member or creditor of the company successfully applies to the court for an order otherwise.

 Schemes of arrangement

 Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the compromise of a company’s liabilities where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up under the IA86; and (ii) has ‘‘sufficient connection’’ to the English jurisdiction. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

 Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on a detailed debt compromise in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75% or more by value and over 50% in number of those creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

 Company voluntary arrangements

 Pursuant to Part I of the IA86, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

 129


-----

###### In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is under secured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

 Statutory order of priorities

 A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with the following statutory order of priority when he or she distributes the proceeds of realised assets to a company’s creditors: (i) proceeds of realisations from assets subject to a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realisation); (ii) expenses of the liquidation or the administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the administrator or liquidator, or any necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process; (iii) ordinary preferential debts, which include (but are not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, employment claims (up to a certain statutory maximum) and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘‘FSCS’’) up to the statutory limit; (iv) secondary preferential debts, being bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the statutory limit, and deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would otherwise have been eligible for FSCS compensation; (v) the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money that the administrator or liquidator must set aside from realisations from floating charge assets to distribute to unsecured creditors—calculated as 50% of the first £10,000 of net realisations and 20% of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £600,000; (vi) proceeds of floating charge asset realisations (less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part); (vii) provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings; (viii) statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at either the higher of the contractual and the official rate; and (ix) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

 Any surplus will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There are no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

 Foreign Currency Risk

 In administration or liquidation, any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling must be converted into pounds sterling at a single rate for each currency as determined by the administrator or liquidator by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the date that the company went into administration or liquidation. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, Noteholders may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Obligor went into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such Noteholders may become entitled (by way of a distribution in the liquidation or administration).

 Post-petition interest

 Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes or any Guarantee to which an English company is a party (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the English company’s insolvency proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the commencement of those proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries.

 130


-----

###### Dispositions in winding-up

 Under section 127 of the IA86, any dispositions of a company’s property made after a winding-up has commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. Subject to certain limited exceptions the compulsory winding-up of a company by the court is deemed to start when a winding-up petition is presented in respect of the company, rather than the date on which the court makes the winding-up order (if any). However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms.

 Trust Assets

 Assets held on trust by the company for a third party generally fall outside the insolvent estate that is available for distribution.

 Antecedent Transaction Laws

 There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

 These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which applies regardless of whether the company is in insolvency proceedings. The granting of security or guarantees by a company could be subject to challenge under these provisions.

 Transactions at an undervalue

 If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the ‘‘SBEEA’’) introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any transaction under section 238 of the IA86.

 A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (2 years before the onset of insolvency, being broadly the commencement of its liquidation or administration); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86 (although there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the transaction is made to a person connected to the company such as a shareholder or a director (a ‘‘connected person’’)).

 The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.

 Preferences

 If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the SBEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any preference claim under section 239 of the IA86.

 A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the

 131


-----

###### position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than that person would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (6 months before the onset of the insolvency or 2 years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86.

 The desire to prefer requires a ‘‘positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation’’ (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by ‘‘proper commercial considerations’’ there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC Bacon [1990] BCLC 324).

 Voidable floating charges

 A floating charge created by a company over its property may be invalid if it was created in the relevant time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of 2 years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset on insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86.

 This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. No court action is required.

 Section 245 of the IA86 does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

 Transactions defrauding creditors

 A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside by the court if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing that person’s interests in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make.

 It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. The victim of the transaction can apply to court himself or herself. The IA86 also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods). The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

 Extortionate credit transactions

 If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, an assignee of such officeholder set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the SBEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any extortionate credit transaction claim under section 244 of the IA86.

 A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

 The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences).

###### Orders

 In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into.

 Fixed and floating charges

 There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (i) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets into cash and use that cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder (see ‘‘—Statutory order of priorities’’ above); (ii) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the secured assets; (iii) general costs and expenses (including a liquidator’s or an administrator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding up or an administration (as applicable) are payable out of the charging company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of a floating charge) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder (see ‘‘—Statutory order of priorities’’ above); (iv) until the floating charge security crystallises, the charging company is entitled to deal with the assets that are subject to the floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that those assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge, and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over those assets in priority to the floating charge security; (v) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to a certain additional challenge under English insolvency law (see ‘‘—Antecedent Transaction Laws—Voidable floating charges’’ above); and (vi) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors and also to ring-fencing (in respect of each of which see ‘‘—Statutory order of priorities’’ above). This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests.

 Under English law, there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document as floating charge security; the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests that are labelled as fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests, rather than held to be floating security interests, will depend on, among other things, whether the charge holder has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the secured assets and their proceeds and, if so, whether that control is exercised by the charge holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the course of its business without the consent of the charge holder, a court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, whatever its other characteristics, notwithstanding that in the security document the security interest may be expressed in words that indicate an intention to create a fixed security interest.

 Secondary Legislation

 UK secondary legislation, such as the Financial Collateral Regulations, may be invalid and ineffective if, among other things, it is not enacted within the scope of the relevant primary statute or within the powers of the relevant rule-making authorities.

 Filings

 The prescribed particulars in respect of a security document under which an English company purports to create security, together with a certified copy of the security document, should be delivered to the Registrar of Companies within 21 days after the date of the security document in accordance with Chapter A1 of Part 25 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘‘CA06’’). Failing this, the security created by the security document will (subject as mentioned in the above Chapter) be void against a liquidator or administrator and any creditor of the charging company. The application of the above Chapter to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Regulations. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out in section 859A(6) of the CA06): (i) a charge in favour of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of the CA06 by or under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted

###### from registration under the Banking Act 2009). Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities. In some cases, such as the registration regime under the CA06, the priority of security interests which are registrable and have been duly registered follows chronological order of creation (subject to certain exceptions—see, for example, and without limitation, the exceptions under ‘‘—Assignments’’ below). In other cases, priority in respect of security interests over certain types of asset depends on the time at which those security interests are registered in a particular asset register. Thus, for instance, the priority of security interests over ships and aircraft are governed by their respective dates of registration in the appropriate register, whether or not the relevant secured party had notice of an earlier unregistered security interest over the relevant asset. Similar rules apply in relation to security interests over registered land and certain intellectual property rights, such as patents.

 Corporate authorisations and maintenance of capital

 The legality, validity and enforceability of the obligations of an Obligor under the Notes are subject to matters affecting companies generally, including that: (i) its entry into and performance of such obligations: (A) are not prohibited by its constitutional documents (or contracts to which it is party); and (B) have been duly authorised and do not breach or result in inconsistency with applicable laws or regulations; and (ii) the documents evidencing such obligations have been duly executed and delivered in accordance with all applicable procedures and laws. In addition, the granting of guarantees or security by an English company could be subject to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

 Enforcement

 Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including guarantees and security).

 Financial assistance

 A liability (an ‘‘Acquisition Liability’’) incurred directly or indirectly for the purpose of an acquisition by any person of shares in an English company or in any holding company (within the meaning contained in section 1159 of the CA06) of that company, or the discharge or reduction of any Acquisition Liability or any liability incurred for the purpose of refinancing any liability that from time to time, directly or indirectly, refinances any such liability, could be subject to challenge if that incurrence, discharge or reduction is unlawful under section 678 or 679 of the CA06. These provisions apply to financial assistance (for example, guarantees or security) granted in connection with an acquisition of shares in an English company, if the English company providing the assistance is either a public company the shares in which are being acquired, a public or private company that is a subsidiary of the public company the shares in which are being acquired, or a public company that is a subsidiary of a private company the shares in which are being acquired.

 Assignments

 Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including, without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The first person to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest.

###### Share mortgages

 A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if the relevant transfers of shares are registered, although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest.

 ‘‘People with significant control’’ regime

 Pursuant to Part 21A of the CA06 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the CA06), from 6 April 2016 certain UK incorporated companies, societates europaeae registered in the UK and limited liability partnerships formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a ‘‘relevant company’’) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the CA06 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a ‘‘notifying party’’) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to the CA06. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the CA06, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of the Notes and the ability of the relevant secured parties to enforce their rights under or in respect of the Notes.

 Application of proceeds

 The enforceability of a provision in a security document that relates to the application of proceeds will be subject to any obligations mandatorily preferred by applicable law.

 Turnover trust

 A turnover trust may be construed as creating a registrable charge under section 859A of the CA06, in which case it will be void in the circumstances set out in section 859H of the CA06, unless the prescribed statement of particulars, together with a certified copy of the agreement or instrument under which the turnover trust arises, are delivered to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with section 859A of the CA06 within 21 days after the date of creation of that charge (see ‘‘—Filings’’ above) (unless an order allowing an extended period is made under section 859F of the CA06).

 Ranking

 The description given by the parties to the ranking of security interests is not determinative of the ranking of those security interests.

 Foreign laws

 If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English law, the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

 Third party rights

 Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

 Amendments

 An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

###### Fetters on exercise of powers

 A provision under which a company or other legal person agrees, or purports to agree, to fetter the exercise of its powers under its constitutional documents or any applicable law (or regulation) may not be enforceable against the company or other legal person.

 Limitations on Security Interests

 Rights in the Security may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Security

 Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Security securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Issuer or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries incorporated as soci´et´e par actions that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (d´eclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favour of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of the Issuer. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

 Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (‘‘soulte’’)

 Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Security exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Security.

 If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

 An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organised by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

 Parallel Debt—Trust

 The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, under the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favour of the Security Agent (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Trust Deed (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’).

 136


-----

###### The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledge governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Security).

 There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n�10-25533 Belv´ed`ere) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognised the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

 The Security is granted to the benefit of the Security Agent as inter alia Parallel Debt Creditor. If the Security created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction is successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Security. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

 The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Trust Deed that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee receives written notice, and subsequently acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

 The concept of ‘‘trust’’ has been recognised by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n�10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of ‘‘trust’’ has not been generally recognised under French law.

 Fraudulent conveyance

 French law contains specific, (‘‘action paulienne’’) provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the relevant insolvency officers, or, in or outside insolvency proceedings, by any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in

 137


-----

###### their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (`a titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Security, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Security or the granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, any guarantees or the security interests in the Security and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Security or any guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or any guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

 Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts

 There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30-2 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganisation proceedings, the safeguard or reorganisation plan which is put to the vote of the creditors’ committees takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the safeguard or judicial reorganisation proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), the Group cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

 United Kingdom

 Each purchaser of Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will be deemed to have made the acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’.

 This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorised person for the purposes of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) (the ‘‘FSMA’’). Accordingly, this Offering Memorandum is only for distribution to and directed at persons who: (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ‘‘Financial Promotion’’) Order 2005 (as amended, the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (‘‘high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.’’) of the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as the ‘‘Relevant Persons’’). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this document relates is available only to and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons. Persons

###### who are not Relevant Persons should not take any action based upon this document and should not rely on it. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than the Issuer and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections afforded to their clients nor for providing advice in relation to the Offering.

 EEA

 The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the Insurance Mediation Directive), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended the PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

 Professional Investors and ECPs only target market. Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led the manufacturers to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

 France. This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared and is not being distributed in the context of a public offering of financial securities in France within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Code mon´etaire et financier and Title I of Book II of the R`eglement G´en´eral of the Autorit´e des march´es financiers (the French financial markets authority) (the ‘‘AMF’’). Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the public in France (‘‘offre au public de titres financiers’’), and neither this Offering Memorandum, nor any offering or marketing materials relating to the Notes must be made available or distributed in any way that would constitute, directly or indirectly, an offer to the public in France.

 The Notes may only be offered or sold in France to qualified investors (‘‘investisseurs qualifi´es’’) acting for their own account and/or to providers of investment services relating to portfolio management for the account of third parties (‘‘personnes fournissant le service d’investissement de gestion de portefeuille pour le compte de tiers’’), all as defined in and in accordance with Articles L. 411-1, L. 411-2, D. 411-1, D. 734-1, D. 744-1, D. 754-1 and D. 764-1 of the French Code mon´etaire et financier.

The Notes will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd., and therefore, the documents relating to the Notes, including, but no limited to, this Offering Memorandum, do not claim to comply with the disclosure standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the listing rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd. and corresponding prospectus schemes annexed to the listing rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd. The Notes are being offered in Switzerland by way of a private placement (i.e., to a small number of selected investors only), without any public advertisement and only to investors who do not purchase the Notes with the intention to distribute them to the public. The investors will be individually approached directly from time to time. This Offering Memorandum, as well as any other material relating to the Notes, is personal and confidential and does not constitute an offer to any other person. This Offering Memorandum, as well as any other material relating to the Notes, may only be used by those investors to whom it has been handed out in connection with the Offering described herein and may neither directly nor indirectly be distributed or made available to other persons without the Issuer’s express consent. This Offering Memorandum, as well as any other material relating to the Notes, may not be used in connection with any other offer and shall, in particular, not be copied and/or distributed to the public in (or from) Switzerland.

 Ireland. Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

 (a) it has not offered, sold, underwritten or placed and will not offer, sell, underwrite or place or do anything in respect of any Notes otherwise than in conformity with the provisions of the Prospectus (Directive 2003/71/EC) Regulations 2005 and the Prospectus (Directive 2003/71/EC) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 of Ireland, the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland, including any rules issued under Section 1363 of the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2017 of Ireland (as amended), and any codes of conduct made under Section 117(1) of the Central Bank Act 1989 of Ireland and any regulations made pursuant to Part 8 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013;

 (b) it has not offered, sold or placed and will not offer, sell or place or otherwise act in Ireland in respect of the Notes, otherwise than in conformity with the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU 596/2014) (as amended), the European (Market Abuse) Regulations 2016 and any rules issued under Section 1370 of the Irish Companies Act 2014 by the Central Bank of Ireland;

 (c) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Irish European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017, and is operating within the terms of its authorisation thereunder and it has complied and will comply with any applicable codes of conduct or practice issued in connection therewith and the provisions of the Investor Compensation Act 1998; and

 (d) in connection with offers or sales of Notes, it has only issued or passed on, and will only issue or pass on, any document received by it in connection with the issue of the Notes to persons who are persons to whom the documents may otherwise lawfully be issued or passed on.

 New Issue of Securities

 The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system.

 The Issuer has applied, through its listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and trade the Notes on the Global Exchange Market; however, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Issuer cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this Offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will continue after this Offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. In addition, market- making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the

 141


-----

###### Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favourable.

 No Sales of Similar Securities

 The Issuer has agreed that they will not during the period from the date of this Offering Memorandum and including the date that is 90 days after such date, without first obtaining the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer and having a tenor more than one year.

 Price Stabilisation and Short Positions

 In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) may engage in transactions that stabilise the market price of the Notes. Such transactions consist of bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain the price of the Notes. Purchases of a security to stabilise the price or to reduce a short position may cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases.

 In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing the Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering.

 Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

 None of the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, none of the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

 Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

 Other Relationships

 The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and/or may in the future engage in, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking and/or other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Issuer or its affiliates. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer’s affiliates (including the Notes). As an example, some or all of the Initial Purchasers (including each of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Goldman Sachs International and their respective affiliates) hold certain securities in respect of debt financing of the Group (including debt securities issued by CLEF) and have entered into certain hedging transactions with members of the Group and/or CLEF in connection with such debt financing. Furthermore, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its subsidiaries may routinely hedge their credit exposure to these entities consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

**1.1** **PROFILE**

**_1.1.1 GETLINK TODAY_**

Initially the promoter of the Channel Tunnel, which is a historic and technological feat, the Group has transformed itself to
provide solutions to increasing demands for mobility.

In 23 years, the Tunnel has fundamentally changed commercial exchanges between the United Kingdom and continental
Europe by enabling the development of new integrated cross-border logistics chains, as well as access to new markets to
be opened up[1]: 30% of British exports to the European Union (some €54.8 billion) and 22% of imports from the European
Union (approximately €60 billion) depend on the rapidity and the reliability of the Tunnel. Exports transiting through the
Tunnel alone help to support 220,000 jobs in the United Kingdom.

The Tunnel allows, every year, more than 20 million passengers to cross the Channel aboard Le Shuttle Passenger Shuttles
and Eurostar passenger trains. The economic footprint generated by the tourists that travel through the Tunnel is estimated
at €2.1 billion, contributing to 45,000 additional jobs in the United Kingdom.

The Group was created in 1986 with the signing of the Concession Agreement, which granted the Franco British consortium
of France Manche SA and The Channel Tunnel Group Limited the construction, financing and operation of the Channel
Tunnel. The operation of the Tunnel started in 1994. In 2007 a new holding company, Groupe Eurotunnel SA (GET SA),
was set up that proposed to all shareholders of the former Eurotunnel structure, to exchange their twinned shares for ordinary
shares of Groupe Eurotunnel SA. This offer was accepted by more than 93% of shareholders. In late 2007, Eurotunnel PLC
and Eurotunnel SA became TNU PLC and TNU SA and were absorbed by Groupe Eurotunnel SA (which has since become
Groupe Eurotunnel SE) in May 2009 and October 2010 respectively.

On 20 November 2017, the Group became Getlink. This new name, which evokes the dynamism of exchanges and links,
marks the Group's entry into a new era of mobility infrastructures. Much more than merely a new page in its history, this new
name is a true commitment to the future with the development and management of safe, modern and environmentallyfriendly mobility infrastructures. All Getlink’s businesses build and strengthen each day the promise made by this new identity
to all of Getlink’s customers: Safe, Smart & Green:

Safe: since its creation, Getlink has chosen never to compromise on security and is still the safest way to cross the
Channel and transport goods.

Smart: digital investment over more than five years has brought Getlink into the era of Smart infrastructure and enables
it to offer customers an experience that is being constantly enriched, whether in terms of service quality, information
accuracy or the reactiveness of its teams.

Green: Getlink operates some of the most environmentally-friendly mobility solutions and infrastructures and the Group
is currently a leader in eco-responsible transport, contributing fully to energy transition.

With this new name, the company confirms its commitment to energy transition, its next generation public service mission
and a new connected business model, that is more innovative and collaborative.

**_1.1.2 THE GROUP’S STRUCTURE_**

Groupe Eurotunnel SE (GET SE) is a European company regulated by French law with a Board of Directors, incorporated
in Paris, France and is governed by the relevant provisions of prevailing French and EU laws and regulations. GET SE is

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

In 2017, the Group was organised around the following three business sectors:

the cross-Channel Fixed Link Concession segment known as the “Fixed Link”,

the Europorte rail freight segment, and

the ElecLink segment.

**The Fixed Link segment**

France Manche SA (FM) and The Channel Tunnel Group Limited (CTG) operate the Tunnel as Concessionaires in
accordance with the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement as described in chapter 8 of this Registration
Document. FM and CTG, whose shares are twinned, are the borrowing entities under the current bank financing agreements.

Eurotunnel Services GIE (ESGIE) and Eurotunnel Services Limited (ESL) employ and manage the Group’s personnel mainly
for the activities of the Concession. Relations between the employing companies of the Group and the Group’s subsidiaries
are described in section 6.2 of this Registration Document.

Centre International de Formation Ferroviaire de la Côte d’Opale (CIFFCO) supplies professional training services in the rail
sector as described in section 6. 2 of this Registration Document.

Eurotunnel SE heads the distribution business in continental Europe (excluding France) of the Truck Shuttle Service activity.

Eurotunnel Financial Services Limited is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (registration no. 490713) to resell
insurance products offered to passengers when they make their reservations. CTG acts as a representative of Eurotunnel
Financial Services Limited for these requirements.

Gamond Insurance Company Limited, a wholly-controlled subsidiary of CTG, is registered in Guernsey and its sole purpose
is to provide insurance against acts of terrorism. Gamond Insurance Company Limited takes out reinsurance with Pool Re.
Eurotunnel Trustees Limited is no longer active.

Euro-Immo GET SAS manages and develops property assets and performs associated activities. Euro-Immo GET SAS
absorbed Société Immobilière et Foncière Eurotunnel (SIFE) in 2017.

Eurotunnel Developments Limited and its subsidiary Orbital Park Limited were responsible for the development of all
property in the United Kingdom which was not used in connection with the operation of the System. These companies are
no longer active.

The Cheriton Resources companies are finance or investment companies and are mostly inactive. London Carex Limited is
involved in a potential project for the development of rail freight in the United Kingdom, as explained in section 1.5 of this
Registration Document.

Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited holds bonds purchased on the market by the Group. It held the floating rate notes until
their redemption in June 2017 as described in note G.1.1.a to the consolidated financial statements contained in section
2.2.1 of this Registration Document and holds the G2 bonds as mentioned in note A.1.2 to the consolidated financial
statements contained in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

**The Europorte rail freight segment**

The holding company Europorte SAS groups together all the rail freight transport subsidiaries (Europorte segment) providing
a wide range of integrated rail freight services, including national and international haulage, local services for secondary
lines, and services to industry (individual junction management, infrastructure maintenance, and wagon loading and
unloading).

The activities of the Europorte segment are carried out by various subsidiaries of the holding company Europorte SAS
including Europorte France (EPF), Europorte Proximité (EPP), Socorail, Europorte Channel (EPC), 20% of the share capital
of Manutention Transport Service SAS (MTS) and EuroSco (management of the rolling stock belonging to the Europorte
companies).

Bourgogne Fret Services, a subsidiary initially created with Cérévia, was acquired 100% by EPF in 2017. EPF, as sole
partner, decided the early dissolution of Bourgogne Fret Services.

GB Railfreight Limited (GBRf), a rail freight operator in the United Kingdom, was sold on 15 November 2016.

**The ElecLink segment**

ElecLink’s corporate purpose is the construction and operation of a 1,000 MW electricity interconnector between the UK and
France. Preliminary work began towards the end of 2016 and the interconnector is scheduled to be brought into service at
the beginning of 2020. GET Elec Limited, a subsidiary of GET SE, holds the entire share capital of ElecLink Limited.

**The maritime segment**

The Group discontinued its maritime business. On 23 June 2017, the Group sold the vessels Berlioz and Rodin to DFDS
A/S and on 10 July 2017, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais was sold to Vansea Shipping Company Limited.

The holding company Euro-TransManche Holding SAS groups together:

the entities that previously owned the ferries (Euro-TransManche, Euro-TransManche 3Be, Euro-TransManche 3NPC);
and

MyFerryLink SAS which used to carry out the marketing activity.

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

**Simplified legal chart of the Group on the date of this Registration Document**

**Planned internal legal reorganisation of the Group**

In order to pursue its development and ensure its capacity to create value in the long term, the Group intends to evolve its
legal structure so that its main activity, namely the operation of the Fixed Link, is in a different sub-group to the other sectors
in the Group; they will be managed and financed separately from the Fixed Link activity.

This internal reorganisation should enable Groupe Eurotunnel SE to be released from its commitments as guarantor under
the Term Loan described in section 8.1.4 of this Registration Document. It should also enable a more flexible funding
structure to be put in place in future that is more suitable for the Group’s development needs.

This evolution is set against the background of the long-term strategy begun by the Group with the aim of developing its
core businesses, namely transport infrastructure and operations. It follows the operations begun in December 2015 with the
withdrawal of two monolines, followed in 2017 by the refinancing of the variable rate debt, which enabled interest payments
to be reduced by €50 million a year and the average cost of the debt to drop below 4%, and then on 7 February 2018 by the
conclusion of an agreement to buy the G2 bonds back from FMS with the possibility of acquiring before 2025 all or part of
the G1 and/or G3 bonds held by FMS.

The objective is to put a more flexible financing structure in place that will allow the Group to develop and deepen its strategy
along the same lines as the ElecLink project.

The reorganisation will involve transferring the companies in the Fixed Link GET SE group to Eurotunnel Holding SAS (in
the GET SE consolidated tax group), which will become the new holding company for the Eurotunnel sub-group and the
holder of the debt obligations of the Term Loan which currently reside with GET SE.

In order to do this, the shares held by Groupe Eurotunnel SE in the Concessionaires, FM and CTG, will be the subject of an
intra-Group contribution in kind agreement in favour of Eurotunnel Holding SAS. This operation will be accompanied by
reclassifications, and in particular of the shares of ESGIE and EFL, as well as of certain other intra-Group obligations.

The implementation of certain operations relating to the reorganisation is subject to the prior approval of the Majority Lenders
acting on the instructions of Assured Guaranty (Europe) Ltd as Controlling Creditor. Assured Guaranty (Europe) Ltd has
given its prior approval subject to certain conditions.

**_1.1.4 GROUP STRATEGY_**

Since its creation, the Group has continually evolved and since 2010 has enjoyed a period of quite remarkable growth as it
has constantly sought to grow and create value, guided by an entrepreneurial spirit.

As indicated in an EY study of October 2016[2], “The Channel Tunnel is an essential part of the UK's transport infrastructure
_that has revolutionised the country's physical accessibility to continental European markets. Since its opening in 1994, the_
_Channel Tunnel has seen 300 million tonnes of goods, more than 23 million trucks, and 38 million tonnes of rail freight._ _The_
_opening of the Tunnel has had far reaching economic consequences, enabling the development of new and varied business_
_models. It has enabled the development of integrated cross-border supply chains in sectors such as manufacturing and_
_retail, driving gains in productivity, and delivering clear and direct benefits to the UK economy. It has also helped to facilitate_
_online purchasing, as express delivery companies ship goods to UK consumers via European hubs. The Tunnel has_
_revolutionised business travel, with Eurostar services providing a fast and reliable service to Paris, Brussels and beyond._
_This has supported businesses in maintaining relationships with overseas customers whilst reducing travel time and cost._
_The opening of the first completed section of High Speed 1 in 2003, and its completion to St Pancras International in 2007,_
_resulted in considerable reductions in journey times and, for a number of destinations, Eurostar is now faster than air travel.”_

**Recent history and context**

_Attractiveness of a unique infrastructure_

The Group has seen outstanding growth in its Shuttle Services since 2010. During that time yields have also increased,
thereby demonstrating the attractiveness of the transport system and the dynamism of the pricing structure.

The high-speed railway business has also enjoyed sustained growth, with a resulting increase in revenue since the toll is
based on passenger numbers with inflation contributing to revenue growth to a certain extent.

At an industrial level, the Group has been able to absorb this growth while maintaining the high quality of service that has
under-pinned its success for nearly 25 years.

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

This period of renewal was also accompanied by the diversification of the Group’s activities beyond the Concession:

in rail freight with Europorte in France, and GBRf in the United Kingdom which was sold in 2016 with a return on
investment in excess of 28%;

with ElecLink, the electrical interconnector project between France and the United Kingdom. The Group acquired full
control of this project in 2016 and work is now well under way.

**A strategic plan for the 21[st] century**

_A mobility player of its time_

Getlink and the Concession are at the very heart of the changes facing passenger and goods transport this century, with
two key challenges emerging: energy transition and the digitalisation of the economy and the customer relationship. Getlink
is determined to transform these challenges into opportunities.

_The Tunnel: a unique and essential mobility player, ready to meet the mobility challenges of tomorrow_

In this context, Getlink has drawn up a strategic plan based, for the Concession business, on two key pillars:

a dynamic pricing policy; and

constant improvements to the railway system, with service quality as the Group’s key focus. Getlink will prioritise the
fluidity and rapidity of its Short Straits’ crossings, which have been its trademark and the source of its success for nearly
25 years. This promise should take account of customer expectations and even anticipate them with digital solutions.

The investment policy to accompany this plan must ensure both controlled and realistic growth in traffic while constantly
improving service quality, essential to asserting and strengthening the Tunnel’s premium positioning.

The company’s digital transformation is key to the plan’s success and will evidently require Group employees to be supported
through the resulting profound changes in working practices and human relations. This support is an essential factor of the
plan.

Beyond this, Getlink, like all long-term transport infrastructure players, is fully aware of the challenges raised by energy
transition and the digital economy. Getlink will take an active role in these changes that will transform the 21[st] century,
participating in discussions on mobility in a low-carbon era and the rise of autonomous driving.

_Key role of transport infrastructure manager_

Getlink plays a key role of transport infrastructure manager for high-speed transport passengers. The Tunnel is ready to
receive new routes such as Amsterdam – London and is willing and able to accommodate new services with annual
passenger numbers potentially in excess of 15 million. Planned investment to improve track infrastructure will enable this
level of growth to be absorbed without difficulty. As indicated in chapter 3 of this Registration Document, the High-Speed
Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services travel through the Tunnel, but Getlink does not operate these
services and cannot exert direct influence on their commercial operation. High-Speed Passenger Train services are faced
with barriers to development such as difficulties implementing efficient border controls and obtaining rolling stock
authorisations (IGC and so on), which can delay, restrict or stop the development of services to new destinations. As
indicated in section 1.2.2 of this Registration Document, the Group has developed various actions relating to the national
authorities and the rail participants to bring these opportunities to fruition and pursues its long-term efforts to resolve the
barriers to development of new services.

_ElecLink: a unique growth driver_

ElecLink, the 1,000 MW electrical interconnector between France and the United Kingdom currently being built by the Group,
is a key component of the Group’s development strategy. ElecLink benefits from a 25-year exemption from the application
of EU regulations: ElecLink can forward sell capacity and has control over all of its assets and revenue. In addition, ElecLink
will make a significant contribution to opening up the UK energy market and will benefit from the congestion income resulting
from the imbalance in the electricity wholesale markets on either side of the Channel.

_Rail freight: a long-term commitment to a highly-promising sector_

The clean-up of the market and the long-delayed restructuring of Fret SNCF is under way. A new profitable business model
for a virtuous economy is being implemented. Europorte, the first private rail operator in the market, is ideally positioned to
become the rail freight benchmark in France.

_Debt management: optimising costs and greater flexibility_

The Group’s debt was put in place during the 2007 financial restructuring. It included debt restriction and limitation clauses
in order to guarantee the Group’s strength and stability, but which have the effect of limiting cost optimisation and financial
flexibility options. The successful refinancing of part of the debt in June 2017 enabled financial costs to be optimised and
the recognition by the markets of the Group’s financial solidity. Getlink undertook a third step in its financial re-organisation
when it concluded an agreement to purchase the G2 bonds from FMS in order to make progress in the clarification of its
structure and correspondingly the optimisation of its financing.

_Robust outlook buoyed by collective goals_

Getlink’s investment policy aims to support and amplify growth in the Group’s markets and focuses on investments that are
complementary to existing asset positions. It aims to develop synergies within the Group and to leverage the specialist
expertise of its teams in managing complex infrastructures and particularly the Tunnel. Alongside operating the Concession,
which will remain its core business, Getlink aims to continue the controlled diversification of its revenues by operating a
profitable rail freight business in France and completing the construction of the ElecLink electricity interconnector which is
already well under way. This project will be a significant driver of growth in Group revenues and margins from 2020. Getlink
may also perform focused acquisitions, alone or in partnership, such as in the transport infrastructure sector that may


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

generate synergies with current businesses while strengthening the diversification of the Group’s business portfolio. That
will also contribute to a reduction in its risk profile including the Group’s exposure to Brexit.

_Sustainable development_

In an environment marked by numerous geopolitical factors, the Group has demonstrated the relevance of its model. True
to its entrepreneurial and responsible vision, Getlink will continue to promote long-term value creation, while maintaining its
commitment to sustainable, environmental and social development, inseparable from its long-term goals.

**1.2** **CROSS-CHANNEL ACTIVITIES**

Under the terms of the Concession Agreement, the States have granted the Concessionaires the right and obligation to
design, finance, construct and operate the Fixed Link between France and the United Kingdom, without prejudice to the
sovereign role of the States in terms of control and border enforcement. The Concession Agreement, which is described in
chapter 8 of this Registration Document, will expire in 2086.

The Fixed Link comprises three tunnels of a length of about 50 kilometres each under the English Channel, as well as the
two terminals at Folkestone in the United Kingdom and Coquelles in France, the fixed equipment and the related installations:

Two rail tunnels with a single track are, during normal service, each used by the trains moving in a single direction.

The third tunnel, located for most of its length between the two main rail tunnels, is a secure means for evacuation and
is also used for Tunnel maintenance.

Two cross over points between the rail tunnels allow trains to change between tunnels during maintenance work on
certain sections of the tunnels.

The Fixed Link is directly connected to the British and French motorway networks, via the Folkestone and Coquelles
terminals which are the departure and arrival points. Retail and food service areas are available to customers at each
terminal. The Fixed Link is also connected to the national French and British rail networks and more particularly to the highspeed lines.

The Fixed Link is an integrated transport system, including road shuttle services (for cars and trucks) and a rail service
(passenger and freight trains). The Concessionaires (FM and CTG) operate the transport system with Shuttles and make
paths available to companies that have a licence allowing them to operate cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Trains
and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services.

**_1.2.1 MAIN MARKETS_**

The Fixed Link offers both a Shuttle Service between Calais and Folkestone for the transport of passengers, cars, coaches
and trucks, and a Railway Network on which Railway Companies can run rail freight trains and High-Speed Passenger
Trains. These services operate in the transport market between continental Europe and the United Kingdom.

**a)** **Freight market**

Freight traffic between continental Europe and the United Kingdom is commonly divided into four distinct modes:

Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied: trucks and trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea on Shuttles or ferries at the
same time as the road tractor and driver, mostly via the Short Straits;

Roll-On/Roll-Off unaccompanied: trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea independently of the road tractor, mostly
via North Sea routes;

rail freight: conventional or Intermodal trains running through the Tunnel; and

Lift-On/Lift-Off: moveable containers or swap bodies loaded on Lift-On/Lift-Off container ships, mostly on the North Sea
routes.

The market is based on three corridors:

the Short Straits: all routes from continental Europe to Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate (including the Tunnel);

the English Channel: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the south coast of the United Kingdom to the south
west of Folkestone; and

the North Sea: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the east coast of the United Kingdom to the north of
Ramsgate (including the Thames estuary).

The modal distribution varies by geographic zone. For accompanied trucks, the long trip across the English Channel or the
even longer trip across the North Sea makes these routes more suitable for Roll-On/Roll-Off unaccompanied and Lift-On/LiftOff solutions.

By contrast, the shorter crossing times of the Short Straits are more suitable to time-sensitive traffic, and attract most of the
Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied traffic.

**Short Straits**

In the freight market, the Truck Shuttle Service is in competition with ferry operators in the accompanied road transport route
across the Short Straits. Over the last 20 years, there has been a marked shift towards the use of accompanied trucks
between continental Europe and the United Kingdom. The market share between the different routes is currently relatively
stable. The Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied mode on the Short Straits routes still continues to grow because it provides the
shortest and quickest route for crossing the Channel. The Short Straits’ share of the freight market (both Truck Shuttles and


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

ferries) rose due to the success of the Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied mode and can be explained by various factors such
as capacity increases and changes in the various operators’ pricing policies.

**b)** **Passenger market**

The international passenger transport market departing to and from the United Kingdom has grown steadily for several years
with growth estimated at close to 4% in 2017 compared to 2016[3].

The Shuttles and the Short Straits ferries carry passengers travelling with their vehicles between Calais in France and Kent
in the United Kingdom (Folkestone for the Shuttles or Dover for the ferries). Transport services for passengers travelling
without their vehicles provided by airlines or by High-Speed Passenger Trains are a marginal and indirect source of
competition to this service. Eurostar services principally operate in the transport market for passengers travelling without
their vehicles between Paris and London and between Brussels and London. Eurostar’s main competitors are the airlines.

**Short Straits**

Day trips permanently declined following the end of duty free purchases in 1999, in favour of long stay (five days and over)
and short stay (fewer than five days).

**c)** **Competitive position in the Short Straits market**

The Shuttle Services are in direct competition with the ferry services and compete indirectly with airlines and, to a lesser
extent, with Eurostar.

**i.** **Ferry operators**

Cross-Channel ferry operators are using larger ships to handle greater volumes of traffic and to achieve economies of scale
over the long term, looking for growth in the freight market rather than in the passenger market (cars).

A public service delegation contract was signed by the Hauts-de-France region on 19 February 2015 in respect of the Calais
Port 2015 project, aimed at merging the ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer and extending the port of Calais and in
particular its ferry terminal. Work is under way with the creation of a platform on which future buildings, roads and bridges
will be built[4]. On 10 April 2015, the Group filed with the Administrative Court of Lille an application for the annulment of the
public service delegation contract, for breach of the principle of equality between candidates, distortion of the basis of public
service delegation law and the granting of guarantees representing illegal State aid. The exchange of pleadings was
completed in the autumn and the investigation was closed on 6 October 2017. The hearing date is not yet known.

Construction has begun on a project to create a new terminal in the Western Docks at the port of Dover to accommodate
larger ferries.

Since 2015, only two ferry companies have operated on the Short Straits (P&O Ferries and DFDS Seaways), offering
reduced capacity compared to that available previously.

**P&O**

P&O Ferries (“P&O”) is a subsidiary of DP World, a worldwide operator of port facilities.

P&O is the largest ferry operator on the Short Straits, with six vessels, and is in direct competition with the Fixed Link in both
the freight market and the passenger market.

P&O operates up to six vessels two of which, at 210 metres, are the longest ships deployed on routes to and from Dover.

**DFDS Seaways**

DFDS Seaways is owned by the Danish company DFDS.

In 2017, DFDS Seaways deployed three vessels on the Dover-Dunkirk route and three on the Calais-Dover route including
two of the ferries that were previously owned by the Group, Berlioz and Rodin, renamed Côte des Dunes and Côte des
Flandres.

**ii.** **Shuttle Services**

**Competitive advantages of the Shuttle Service**

The Group considers that, under normal operating conditions, its Shuttle Service benefits from the following competitive
advantages over ferries:

safety: the Group offers a reinforced safety system at the site of Coquelles and additional means of control before
boarding that reassure Truck Shuttle customers;

speed: the standard travel time between the French and British motorways is much shorter than that of its competitors;

departure frequency: the Shuttle Service runs more frequently than any of its competitors, and it runs every day of the
year;

convenience: with the GSM-P system, Shuttle Services customers have uninterrupted access to GSM and 4G services
in the Tunnel;

reliability: unlike the ferries, the Shuttle Service is not affected by sailing conditions and is not dependent on the weather;
and

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

environmentally-friendly: the electric power it uses for traction generates much lower greenhouse gas emissions than
fossil fuels.

The Group has decided to further enhance these advantages by implementing a digital transformation plan focusing on six
key areas (service fluidity; customer experience; maintenance; systems, and so on).

Eurotunnel’s Shuttle Service also offers:

a freight service that is independent of the passenger service, which is subject to the seasonality of tourist traffic;

more efficient management of loading/unloading; and

the direct management of its terminals, in contrast to the ferries, for which port operations are managed by third parties.

**iii.** **Airlines**

Airlines, and particularly low cost airlines, also have an indirect impact on the Short Straits market. These companies serve
many destinations in continental Europe and thus compete with operators in the Short Straits, including the Passenger
Shuttle Service in the short stay leisure market. Many destinations in France are now served by low cost airlines offering an
alternative means of transport between France and the United Kingdom.

**iv.** **Eurostar**

To a lesser extent, Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains compete indirectly with the Passenger Shuttle Service in the
leisure market.

**_1.2.2 FIXED LINK: ACTIVITIES_**

The Fixed Link is an infrastructure that enables vehicles aboard Shuttles to cross the Channel: the Group operates and
directly markets its Shuttle Services. High-Speed Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services may also
travel through the Tunnel in return for payment of a toll: the Group does not operate these services, but manages their safe
and efficient passage through the Railway Network.

**a)** **Shuttle transport activities**

The Group operates Truck Shuttles transporting heavy goods vehicles and Passenger Shuttles transporting passengers in
their vehicles (cars, coaches, motorbikes, motor homes).

**i.** **Truck Shuttle Service**

**Introduction**

The Truck Shuttle Service carries trucks between France and the United Kingdom on Shuttle trains. On each terminal,
drivers pass through dedicated check-in, security and border control facilities. Real time information has been improved (onboard information system with screens, customer information panels on the approach route and the “Elite” customer
information processing software). Other facilities for trucks are located close to the terminals. Drivers and passengers do
not remain in their vehicles during the crossing, but travel in a separate carriage (“Club Cars” which were completely
refurbished in 2014) specially designed for this purpose.

**Strategy**

_Truck service marketing strategy_

The strategy is based on optimising Truck Shuttle revenue and a pricing policy that reflects the value of the service provided
by the Group as well as its speed, ease and reliability.

Throughout the year, the Group gives priority to customers under contract, only providing transport to occasional customers
as available capacity allows. The Group has put in place a mechanism to optimise Truck Shuttle revenue based on a pricing
policy consisting of more flexible prices, adjustable according to demand and available capacity. The aim is to encourage
an improved distribution of truck flows at all times of day and all week long, so that capacity and load factors can be optimised
whilst maintaining service quality during peak days.

**Truck Shuttle Service market share**

The Group estimates that its share of the Truck Shuttle Service market on the Short Straits corridor has evolved as follows:

**2017** **2016**


**Market share**


**Vehicles**


**(estimate)** **Vehicles** **Market share**


Accompanied trucks * 1,637,280 39.1% 1,641,638 39.2%

_*_ _Number of accompanied trucks transported by the Truck Shuttle Service. The market share percentages are derived by calculating the Truck Shuttle_
_Service’s truck traffic as a proportion of the total accompanied truck traffic on the Short Straits market as reported by IRN Services Limited._

The cross-Channel truck market was stable in 2017 year-on-year (growth of 0.1%) after increasing over 5% in 2016, reaching
a record high for the overall Short Straits market in 2017, despite the disruptions in the geopolitical environment since 2015.

The number of trucks transported by the Truck Shuttles and their market share in 2017 remained relatively stable compared
to 2016. However, the start of 2017 was affected by a temporary decrease in fresh fruit and vegetable traffic due to the
exceptionally bad weather conditions in southern Europe. November was affected by a reduction in capacity due to a

temporary increase in maintenance operations. These negative factors were compensated by a number of traffic records
during the rest of the year and by record traffic for the second half of the year.

**ii.** **Passenger Shuttle Service (Le Shuttle)**

**Introduction**

The Passenger Shuttle Service carries cars, motor homes, caravans, coaches, motorcycles and trailers between France
and the United Kingdom on Shuttles. Customers remain in their vehicle throughout the crossing, which normally lasts
approximately 35 minutes from platform to platform. Each Passenger Shuttle has two sections: a double deck section mainly
for cars and motorcycles and a single deck section reserved for vehicles higher than 1.85 metres, mainly coaches, minibuses
and cars with roof boxes or towing caravans.

The Passenger Shuttle Service can operate up to five departures per hour in each direction.

**Strategy**

The business model aims to optimise Passenger Shuttle revenue by increasing the average revenue per Shuttle departure.

Since 2016, the Fixed Link has run a service specifically for commercial vans travelling on Passenger Shuttles, the VP (Van
on Pax) service, which offers transporters the choice of travelling with their commercial vans on board Passenger Shuttles
if they have a reservation. New scanners on the passenger terminals reinforce security measures for this service. By freeing
up space on Truck Shuttles while filling up space on Passenger Shuttles, the VP service allows transporters to avoid peak
periods for the Truck Shuttle Service and enables the company to optimise the use of available capacity.

_Pricing policy: Dynamic Pricing_

The pricing system adjusts ticket prices according to departure time and Shuttle load factor. This policy optimises passenger
revenue and the average ticket price for passenger vehicles (cars, motor homes, caravans, motorcycles, and so on).

Tickets can be bought in advance from the website (www.eurotunnel.com), by telephone from the customer service centre,
from travel agents and on arrival at check-in. Currently more than 80% of Le Shuttle customer bookings are made online.

_Adapting capacity to demand_

The capacity of the Passenger Shuttle Service is constantly adjusted to improve load factors and reduce costs. Operational
changes are made help to constantly improve this strategy, such as better distribution of Shuttle departures during the day,
fewer Passenger Shuttles running at off peak times and more during peak times and the optimisation of train crew
management.

This policy allows for an optimisation of the load factor, which has increased from 45% in 2004 to 59% in 2017.

_The Customer Experience_

As a service business, Eurotunnel Le Shuttle puts the customer at the core of its strategy and implements ways to enhance
their satisfaction and loyalty:

Improved communication of real-time information, for each customer at every stage of their experience with the Group,
with the roll-out of the digital transformation plan.

Personalisation of services, that is to say, taking into consideration the specific needs of each customer segment, such
as owners of electric vehicles and those travelling with their pets. The Group works constantly to improve the service,
renovating the passenger building on the Coquelles terminal (World Duty Free, lounge, and so on), enhancing real-time
communication with customers through iBoarding, and installing fast universal chargers (for any type of electric vehicle)
and specific charging points for Tesla cars. Since July 2017, the new William Turner building has welcomed Flexiplus
premium customers in France and the new Flexiplus building on the UK terminal will open to customers in 2018.

The terminals are equipped with automatic terminals for check in for all pre-reserved customers as well as a system that
reads licence plates. RFID technology (an electronic chip included in the transport document) has been introduced
progressively since June 2016.

In 2017, the Group launched the Fixed Link’s digital transformation project. This new collaborative digital vision is
founded on five pillars comprising clear goals. Two of these pillars (in addition to optimising infrastructure, data
processing and the corporate culture) relate directly to customer service:

   - Optimisation of flows on the terminals to further reduce transit times, by pooling data collection and equipping teams
on the ground with digital tools enabling them to access and share this information.

   - Enhancement of the customer experience by meeting their basic needs and providing an internet connection and
access to information, particularly in the event of disruption; overhaul of IT systems to implement an extensive,
reliable and secure digital plan serving customers and terminal operations.

**Passenger Shuttle Service market share**

The Group estimates that its share of the car and coach passenger markets on the Short Straits were as follows:

**2017** **2016**


**Market share**


**Vehicles**


**(estimate)** **Vehicles** **Market share**


Cars * 2,595,247 54.9% 2,610,242 55.0%

Coaches ** 51,229 39.1% 53,623 38.1%

_*_ _Number of vehicles transported by the Passenger Shuttle Service. The market share percentages are calculated by converting the number of vehicles_
_transported into Car Equivalent Units (“CEU”) and determining the Passenger Shuttle Service’s share of total CEU transported on the Short Straits as_
_reported by IRN Services Limited._
_**_ _Number of vehicles transported by the Passenger Shuttle Service. The market share percentages are calculated by determining the Passenger Shuttle_
_Service’s share of the total number of coaches transported on the Short Straits as reported by IRN Services Limited._

In contrast to the trend in the overall market which increased 4% in 2017, the Short Straits car market remained relatively
stable, with a slight contraction of 0.2%. Car market share remained relatively stable compared to the previous year, at
54.9%. Compared to 2016, cross-Channel car traffic in 2017 was affected by non-recurring events including the Euro football
tournament in 2016 and elections in France and the UK in 2017.

The Short Straits cross-Channel coach market contracted by approximately 7.0% in 2017 but the Passenger Shuttle’s coach
market share increased by one point compared to the previous year, to 39.1%.

**b)** **Railway Network**

In 2017, the Group earned 28% of its revenue (32% of Fixed Link revenue) from the use of the Railway Network by HighSpeed Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services. The Group does not operate these trains but manages
their safe and efficient passage through the Tunnel infrastructure.

The use of the Tunnel by the Railway Companies is governed by the Railway Usage Contract with the national Railways,
which is in force until 2052. Under this charging framework, the Railways are obliged to pay to the Group variable charges
according to the number of passengers on High-Speed Passenger Trains as well as fixed annual charges. The variable
charges are determined on the basis of a toll formula that applies throughout the life of the Railway Usage Contract, and
which takes into account the effects of inflation to a certain extent. In addition, the Railways are required to contribute to the
operating costs of the System, as well as to investment costs relating to the modernisation of equipment.

This long-term pricing framework for the Railway Usage Contract is applied and published every year by the Concessionaires
in the Network Statement which sets out access conditions to its Railway Network for all Railway Companies, for the
operation of High-Speed Passenger Trains and freight trains, as well as the pricing scale for the year under consideration.
In this framework, a simplified pricing mechanism for freight trains was put in place, with charging per freight train instead of
charging per tonne of freight.

The Group’s revenue from its Railway Network depends solely on variable charges received based on the number of
passengers transported by Eurostar High-Speed Passenger Trains and the number of freight trains, as well as the annual
fixed charges and the Railways’ contribution to operating costs.

In 2017, the Group generated revenue €293 million from the use of its Railway Network.

**i.** **High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar and new market entrants)**

**Market developments**

The market for High-Speed Passenger Train services (Eurostar and future new market entrants) comprises business and
leisure passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. The market is geographically diverse
and includes on the one hand inter-capital travel between London and Paris or London and Brussels, and on the other hand
a wider flow of passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.
Eurostar also operates a direct service to Disneyland Paris, and to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille during the spring and
summer and a service to Bourg-Saint-Maurice in winter.

Combined data on market growth for Eurostar and the airlines is presented below.

Eurostar recorded a growth in traffic of 2% on average over five years (from 2009 to 2014) followed by a decrease after the
shock of the terrorist attacks in 2015/2016. A recovery in 2017 saw volumes return to close to (within 1%) of those of 20142015.

**The competitive environment of High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar)**

Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains connect London with the centre of Paris and Brussels and compete directly with
traditional and low-cost airlines operating these routes in the business and leisure segments, in terms of travel time,
frequency, comfort and price. In addition, for short-stay leisure trips, Eurostar also competes with low-cost airlines in terms
of price, capacity and choice of destination, not only for destinations served by Eurostar but also for other short-haul
destinations. Within the framework of the liberalisation of the international rail passenger transport market on 1 January
2010, the Group published its efficient and non-discriminatory conditions for access in its Network Statement. They offer all
railway companies including new entrants the opportunity to operate cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Train services
to existing or new destinations in competition with each other and with the airline sector.

**High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar)**

Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Train services are operated by Eurostar International Limited, owned 55% by SNCF, 5%
by SNCB, and 40% by a consortium comprising CDPQ, the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and Hermes
Infrastructure.

Since 2007, the High-Speed Passenger Trains services have benefited from the high-speed line between London and the
Tunnel which reduced the transit time between Paris and London or Brussels and London by around 20 minutes and
London’s St Pancras International station which improves rail links with Northern England (proximity of rail services from St
Pancras, King’s Cross and Euston stations). Ebbsfleet International station, located near the M25 London orbital motorway,
also allows Eurostar to expand its catchment area.

In 2017, Eurostar ran 12 to 18 departures in each direction between Paris and London and 7 to 10 trains in each direction
between London and Brussels on business days, with adjustments depending on the day, the season and the destination.
Some trains make intermediate stops at Ebbsfleet or Ashford International in the United Kingdom and at Calais-Fréthun or
Lille-Europe in France. Eurostar also runs a service to Disneyland Paris four to seven days a week (except in January) and
seasonal services from London and Ashford to Bourg-Saint-Maurice with two return journeys a week (from December to
April) as well as a spring/summer seasonal service (May to September) from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille with
three or four return journeys a week.

In 2017, the number of Eurostar passengers (travelling through the Tunnel) increased by 3% on average over the year to
10.3 million (source: Eurostar) following a recovery in demand after a market context strongly affected in 2016 by the terrorist
attacks in Paris, Brussels and Nice. This recovery led to record traffic volumes at the end of the year in December and for
the fourth quarter. Calculated in accordance with the pricing framework indexing formula set-out in the Railway Usage
Contract, the unit toll per passenger paid by Eurostar increased by 1.2% in 2017.

Since November 2015, Eurostar has been progressively commissioning the 17 new e320 distributed drive trains ordered
from Siemens. More comfortable (with on-board WiFi and individual sockets) and more powerful than the previous trains
(top speed of 320km/h), they can accommodate 900 passengers (20% more than the original fleet) and are equipped with
interoperable systems that are compatible with the development of services to new destinations. These trains are gradually
replacing the majority of first generation trains after the test periods needed to eliminate any residual defects, in a Eurostar
rolling stock fleet that also includes modernised Alstom e300 trains with a similar level of comfort to that of the e320.

Eurostar announced on 9 February 2018[5] the start of its new direct service between London and Amsterdam on 4 April
2018, which marks a historic milestone in the expansion of high-speed international rail travel. For the first time, passengers
can travel from the heart of London directly to the Netherlands in only three hours at a speed of 300km/h. Initially, passengers
will travel direct from London to Amsterdam and Rotterdam although in the direction Amsterdam to London, they will change
at Brussels where passport and security checks will be carried out. This is a temporary measure while the UK and Dutch
governments reach an agreement regarding passport checks on departure from the Netherlands, in the same way as
happens for the other main Eurostar destinations. The governments have committed to putting in place an agreement before
the end of 2019 in order to allow Eurostar to run a direct service in both directions.

**Development of new destinations**

In 2015, Eurostar launched a new direct service from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille, operating seasonally in the
spring and summer months. However, this service requires passengers to disembark at the Lille station on the return trip for
border controls and therefore there remains considerable potential for improving competitiveness.

_5_ _Eurostar press release 9 February 2018._


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

Eurostar announced the launch of its new direct service between London, Rotterdam and Amsterdam from April 2018. After
having resolved all the technical and equipment issues associated with this project (approval of trains, modifications to
stations, train paths, and so on), the key to achieving the full development potential of this service lies in the introduction of
juxtaposed controls (Dutch and UK) on departure from the Netherlands. This requires efficient cooperation between the
national authorities.

Further opportunities exist for services to Germany (Cologne, Frankfurt), southern France (Marseille, the French Riviera,
Bordeaux) and/or Switzerland (Geneva).

In 2010, Deutsche Bahn stated its intention to launch ICE High-Speed Passenger Train services from London to Cologne
and Frankfurt. The operational outline was approved by the IGC in June 2013 but the schedule is yet to be confirmed due
to project delays.

To help accelerate the realisation of these opportunities, the Group has developed the ETICA-Pax (Eurotunnel Incentive for
_Capacity Additions - Passengers), a financial assistance mechanism for the launch of new cross-Channel High-Speed_
Passenger Train services. Through the ETICA-Pax programme, the Group contributes to creating direct services to new
destinations by reducing the launch cost of these new services and increasingly rewarding Railway Companies for their
market development efforts.

At the same time, the Group also continues its long-term efforts with national authorities and rail organisations to
progressively eliminate the barriers to the development of new destinations (efficient security and border controls, rolling
stock authorisations, investment in interoperability, improved access to stations, long-term visibility, and so on). Significant
progress has been achieved with the implementation of “open access” for international passenger services across Europe
and the increasing application of interoperability standards, notably with efforts to standardise IGC technical requirements
for cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Trains. Further progress remains necessary, in particular with regards to border
controls, to develop solutions that are efficient and tailored to the type of destination (juxtaposed controls for frequent
services between capital cities and on-board control or controls on arrival for regular regional services) and thereby preserve
the benefits of speed and convenience essential to the competitiveness of High-Speed Passenger Train services. The Group
is working closely with rail infrastructure managers to facilitate the elimination of these barriers and the development of new
direct destinations (notably on interoperability investments and boarding areas in stations).

**ii.** **Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services**

**Market developments**

Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services compete with most modes of sea and rail transport between continental Europe and
the United Kingdom, offering their own advantages of efficiency and attractiveness with a Channel crossing without the need
for modal shift, in a particularly environmentally-friendly means of transport and potentially a service quality independent of
weather conditions and road networks.

After a significant surge in traffic from 2010 to mid-2015, Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services traffic on the Fixed Link
dropped by a half abruptly in the second half of 2015 due to disruption by migrants in the Calais area, before stabilising in
2016 and returning to strong growth in 2017.

The freight volume transported by the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services is summarised below.

**Train Operator's Rail Freight Services** **2017** **2016**

Number of train crossings 2,012 1,797

_Sources: Eurotunnel, DB Cargo on behalf of BRB, SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Rail Operations Group and Europorte._

**Competitive environment of the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services**

Rail freight through the Tunnel, originally developed by state-run Railways, has had a history of disappointing results and
organisational difficulties. International rail freight is also held back by inadequate national infrastructure (in particular train
gauge, length and weight restrictions in the UK, quality and availability of paths in France), distortions in favour of sea and
road transport and excessive constraints (whether regulatory, social or technical).

Rail freight trains are in competition with most modes of freight transport in operation between continental Europe and the
United Kingdom and, in particular, with unaccompanied maritime services via the North Sea, with onward road or rail
transport in continental Europe.

**Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services**

Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services between continental Europe and the United Kingdom are run by Railway Companies
including DB Cargo (on behalf of BRB), SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Europorte, Rail Operations Group and
potentially any freight train operator in open access. Three different types of freight trains use the Railway Network:

Intermodal trains, composed of platform wagons transporting containers or swap bodies;

conventional trains (carrying palletised goods in enclosed wagons or bulk loads in adapted wagons such as tankers,
hoppers, platforms, and so on) carried as a trainload; and

trains with specialised wagons for transporting new cars.


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

In order to revive cross-Channel rail freight, the Group adopted in 2007 a strategy based on three policies: (i) development
of open access for rail freight operators, (ii) efficient processing of border constraints, and (iii) a simplified and competitive
pricing policy.

In 2013, with the aim of promoting the development of Railway Company freight train traffic in the Tunnel, the Group set up
a programme to help the launch of new services (ETICA-Freight). These initiatives demonstrated their pertinence with a
sustained period of traffic growth between 2010 and mid-2015 and a total increase of more than 40% in the number of trains,
including in particular the creation of new intermodal services and flows for aluminium and automobile components.

This growth dynamic was halted abruptly in the summer of 2015 by the intrusion of migrants on the SNCF tracks in Fréthun
during the peak of the migrant crisis in the Calais area, leading to a protracted period of severe disruption to Train Operators’
Rail Freight Services until the situation was remedied at the end of October 2015. This resulted in the loss of half of the
cross-Channel rail freight services which shifted either to unaccompanied services or to container transport via the North
Sea, or more generally to transportation by road.

In 2016, the set-up of effective security for cross-Channel rail freight operations allowed traffic to stabilise at the level reached
at the end of 2015 and the start of a recovery thanks to the ramp-up of services assisted by ETICA-Freight. In 2017, freight
train traffic returned to strong growth in train numbers (+12%) and tonnage transported (+17%).

**Development of services and competitiveness**

Following the setback in 2015, with the loss of half of cross-Channel rail freight services, the Group informed the European
Commission that the common rail freight growth objectives could not be attained. The Group continues to work with the
governments and the Railway Companies on implementing solutions to stimulate the revival of this traffic.

In 2017, the Group launched the construction of a full-train scanner on the national railway network in Fréthun, representing
an investment of over €6 million. This scanner will enable customs officials to control freight trains moving at a speed of
20km/h, thereby enhancing the security and fluidity of cross-Channel rail freight and consequently its attractiveness. In
addition, the Group extended its ETICA-Freight financial aid programme to support the launch of new services, generating
a growing interest in the development of new services.

In order for these growth efforts to produce their full effect, the Group continues to draw the attention of authorities to the
need to progressively address the barriers to development existing on the national networks (size, length, capacity, quality,
border constraints, etc.). These continue to hold back the development of cross-Channel rail freight and offer considerable
potential for efficiencies waiting to be realised.

**c)** **Other revenue**

The Fixed Link generated €18 million in other revenue in 2017, representing 2% of the Group’s total revenue. This other
revenue consists mainly of (i) revenue from third party retail businesses in the terminals on both sides of the Tunnel, (ii)
revenue for telecommunication lines in the Tunnel, (iii) revenue related to the property business, (iv) the sale of travel
insurance products in the United Kingdom, (v) revenue related to CIFFCO training and (vi) a first revenue from Energy
Savings Certificates generated by energy efficiency investment in third generation Truck Shuttles as detailed in chapter 6 of
this Registration Document.

**i.** **Revenue from third party retail businesses**

The Group has built facilities for its customers on its two terminals in France and the United Kingdom, including shops and
other retail outlets.

Access to the shops, bars and restaurants is available only to customers travelling on the Shuttle Services. They are located
inside the terminals, after check-in. These facilities are operated by third parties under three to ten-year concession
agreements on the French side and under leases on the British side.

The Group’s strategy is to offer travellers who choose to stop before making the crossing a choice and level of service
consistent with the overall quality and value of service offered by the Group. The Victor Hugo passenger terminal building
in Folkestone and the Charles Dickens building in Coquelles offer the highest international airport standards to welcome
customers in a pleasant environment.

In 1994, a contract was signed for 30 years for the operation of three petrol stations located at the entrance and exit of the
two terminals.

The Group also earns modest revenue from renting advertising boards on both terminals and around the terminal exit routes.

**ii.** **Property business**

The Group owns and manages plots of land near its French and British terminals.

At the beginning of the Fixed Link project, the Group was given responsibility for local land development as an extension of
its mission to design, build and operate the Fixed Link. The Fixed Link is not just a transport infrastructure: it was also
designed as a platform for the future economic development of the Kent and Calais regions. The Group, in the interests of
sustainable development, restored the site of the former factory where the tunnel lining segments were made. This
restoration work has paved the way for a major commercial and tourism development project to stand alongside the Cité de
l’Europe shopping centre in Coquelles.

As part of efforts to strengthen its partnership with the town of Sangatte-Blériot and the Conseil Général of the Pas-deCalais, the Group signed an agreement with the Conseil Général on 6 January 2009 covering measures to support this
ambitious tourism development project.


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

As part of the responsibility for local land development and in order to further boost the appeal of the Calais area as a tourist
destination, Euro-Immo GET, a Group subsidiary, was awarded on 18 February 2013 the land development concession for
the integrated seaside eco-village and golf resort project at the Porte des Deux Caps.

In general terms, the development of the area entrusted to Euro-Immo GET, the project supervisor, encompasses all the
work relating to roads, networks, open spaces and various facilities designed to meet the needs of the future occupiers,
owners, inhabitants and users of the new buildings. The concessionaire will manage the assets acquired until they are
transferred to the builders. The concession will last for 10 years.

The objection filed by GDEAM (a group created to protect the environment in the Montreuil-sur-Mer district) against the
prefect’s decision to declare the project to be in the public interest was rejected by the Administrative Court of Lille on 24
January 2017. GDEAM appealed this decision to the Administrative Court of Appeal in Douai on 23 March 2017. The
proceedings are ongoing and Euro-Immo GET filed its defence on 27 November 2017.

**iii.** **Training activity: CIFFCO, the Opal Coast International Railway Training Centre**

CIFFCO is a subsidiary of the Group and an expert in railway operations. The CIFFCO training centre is open to all rail
operators, infrastructure managers or industrial concerns for the training of their staff. CIFFCO’s activities and facilities are
described in chapter 6 of this Registration Document.

**_1.2.3 FIXED LINK: CAPACITIES_**

**a)** **The System**

**i.** **The Tunnel**

The number of trains or Shuttles that can pass through the Tunnel every hour is limited. Tunnel capacity is expressed in
terms of the number of standard paths per hour in each direction. A standard path is defined as the time it takes a Shuttle
train operating at 140km/h to cover that part of the System which, under normal operating conditions, is used by all other
trains travelling through the Tunnel. One of the key factors determining the Tunnel’s capacity is the signalling system. At the
date of this Registration Document, the System permits 20 standard paths per hour in each direction.

Under the Railway Usage Contract, trains using the Railway Network are entitled to use up to 50% of the hourly capacity of
the Tunnel that is allowed by the signalling system. This currently amounts to ten standard paths per hour in each direction
for High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar and new entrants) and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services. High-Speed
Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services, because of their faster or slower speeds relative to the Group’s
Truck and Passenger Shuttle Services, use more than one standard path to travel through the Tunnel. At peak times, speeds
can be adjusted to maximise the number of trains and Shuttles travelling through the Tunnel. In 2017, the maximum number
of standard paths used by Passenger and Truck Shuttle Services was ten per hour in each direction.

Rail freight trains currently transport an average load of about 500 to 600 tonnes each, although some of them can transport
more than 1,000 tonnes of freight, and travel at speeds varying between 100 and 120km/h. An increase in the average load
or the travel speed of these trains would allow the Railway Companies to increase rail freight traffic without additional use
of the Tunnel’s capacity. Similarly, increasing unit capacity and occupancy on High-Speed Passenger Trains (those of
Eurostar and new market entrants) and synchronising them so that they run in sequence would enable more passengers to
be transported without using additional Tunnel capacity. For both types of traffic, the increased unit occupancy rate of the
trains enables Railway Companies to increase the economic efficiency of their services, thus creating a natural incentive to
make optimum use of the Tunnel capacity. In this context, the new e320 trains put into service by Eurostar since
November 2015 offer a 20% increase in unit capacity compared to the original fleet, leading to a proportional increase in the
Tunnel capacity in terms of the number of passengers. In the same way, the introduction in 2007 of a pricing structure based
on the number of rail freight trains has led to an increase in the average load factor of 45% in 11 years.

Under the terms of the Railway Usage Contract, the Group may use any surplus capacity not used by the Railway
Companies if they have not confirmed their capacity requirement by the previous day. Use of this surplus capacity provides
the Group with additional flexibility in optimising the flow of traffic and scheduling passenger and freight trains and Shuttle
Service departures.

At the date of this Registration Document, the Tunnel’s capacity under normal operating conditions does not constitute a
significant constraint limiting growth in the different types of traffic. The average occupancy rate, which corresponds to the
total current consumption of paths (Eurotunnel Shuttles and Railways) to the total capacity available, is 58%, which allows
for substantial traffic growth in the future.

As part of its five year strategic thinking for the Fixed Link, and as indicated in section 1.1.4 of this Registration Document,
the Group is working on optimising availability of the Tunnel itself.

In the medium or long term, the Group believes that it will be possible to increase the Tunnel’s capacity by the following
means:

setting uniform operating speeds for all trains, which would allow more trains to run on the same number of standard
paths. Currently, goods trains travel in the Tunnel at a speed of 100 or 120km/h, while High-Speed Passenger Trains
can reach a speed of 160km/h in the Tunnel. These speed differentials use a large part of the System capacity, because
they require the Group to leave greater intervals between trains than would be necessary if they all travelled at the same
speed. Use of the System’s capacity could therefore be improved by shifting slow or infrequent freight trains to off-peak
times, and by scheduling trains that travel at speeds higher (160km/h) or lower (120km/h) than the standard path
(140km/h) so that they run in sequence during peak hours;

increasing the power of the locomotives pulling the Shuttles to allow the use of longer trains or reduce transit times;

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

improving the electrical power supply with the replacement of the booster with better and more powerful equipment,
aimed at improving the quality of the electrical signal;

reducing the headway between trains using the Tunnel (to 2 minutes 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes currently) so as
to raise System capacity to 24 standard paths per hour in both directions, although this would mean improving the fixed
equipment; and

improving the signalling system, notably with the European Train Control System (ETCS) that aims to optimise border
crossings while guaranteeing traffic safety.

Some of these measures require approval by the IGC, which has supervisory authority over Tunnel operation.

A dedicated optical relay system using 2G, 3G and 4G telephone and GSM-P mobile internet networks enables passengers
on Shuttle Services and High-Speed Passenger Trains to use their mobile phones both to make calls and access the internet
is available in the Tunnel.

A ground to train radio communications network in the Channel Tunnel, the GSM-R (Global System for Mobile
Communications – Railway) was introduced as part of a strategy of constant improvement and modernisation of its
infrastructure in order to offer complete interoperability with the entire trans-European rail network.

**ii.** **Terminals**

Currently, 10 boarding platforms are in service on the French terminal and 10 on the British terminal.

Both terminals were designed so that the number of boarding platforms could be increased to 16 on each terminal. In order
to maintain traffic fluidity and to increase the number of hourly Truck Shuttle departures, capacity at the terminals will be
expanded. As stated in section 1.6.2 of this Registration Document, the Terminal 2015 project inter alia enabled the
construction at Coquelles of a secure parking area and an increase in the number of toll booths and in the number of access
lanes to the check-in barriers.

These systems improve traffic flow and reduce operating costs.

**b)** **Rolling stock**

In 2014, the Group ordered three new Truck Shuttles, each with a capacity of 32 trucks and benefiting from the latest
technological advances for reinforced robustness and reliability. They were delivered in 2017 and therefore at the date of
this Registration Document, the Group has 18 Truck Shuttles (six with a capacity of 31 trucks and 12 with a capacity of 32
trucks). This enhanced fleet will enable the Group to increase its capacity by 20% and, in the long-term, to move to a peak
period frequency of eight departures per hour compared to the current six.

The Group has nine Passenger Shuttles each able to carry up to 180 cars or 120 cars and 12 coaches.

Punctuality, reliability, adaptability and safety are the key words of this investment programme, with:

the planned replacement of six Breda Shuttles by 2021, and

the comprehensive refurbishment of the entire fleet of nine Passenger Shuttles by 2025 enabling an increase in capacity,
a higher utilisation rate and a new customer experience (connectivity, display, comfort, and so on).

Planned changes in the Shuttle fleet are described in section 1.2.4 of this Registration Document.

**_1.2.4 FIXED LINK: RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM_**

**a)** **Tunnel availability and maintenance**

Scheduled weekly maintenance of the Tunnel is planned and structured so as to promote efficient use of the Tunnel and
cause minimal disruption to commercial operations. In order to optimise maintenance activities, overnight maintenance has
been reduced from three to two nights per weekend and maintenance work on the terminals on Friday and Saturday nights
has been limited.

The Group has set itself an objective of limiting service disruptions due to fixed equipment failure to less than 0.75% despite
continual traffic growth. This objective was again easily met in 2017.

The operational plan aiming to limit fire risk (Salamandre Plan) and the creation of fire-fighting stations (SAFE) contribute
towards protecting the infrastructure in case of fire on board a Shuttle or a train.

Since 2015, the Group has also undertaken work to reinforce the catenary that supplies the power required to operate the
Shuttles and trains circulating in the rail tunnels.

**b)** **Rail replacement**

Rails at the terminals are replaced as part of the routine maintenance programme, without major disruption to commercial
services. The strategy implemented has reduced costs without harming the quality of the track. This strategy aims to avoid
systematically replacing both lines of rails, instead replacing only those rails that are worn or that present defects.

**c)** **Maintenance and availability of rolling stock**

The Group has also set itself the objective of achieving better utilisation of its transport capacity by improving load factors
and the availability of the rolling stock by modifying maintenance procedures in order to optimise periods of operation.


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

The Group’s repair and maintenance programmes have helped to improve the reliability of the electric locomotives and
Truck and Passenger Shuttles. In planning its maintenance programme, the Group’s objectives are to:

ensure that safety requirements are met;

avoid rolling stock being out of service for prolonged periods; and

maximise the number of Shuttles available at peak hours.

Under current maintenance programmes, light maintenance and safety inspections are carried out every 44 days or
30,000km for the locomotives, Truck Shuttles and Passenger Shuttles. Every 600 to 1,200 days, depending on the type and
the number of kilometres it has covered, each component is taken out of service for one to six weeks to undergo an extensive
preventive maintenance programme.

The Group is implementing simplification and renovation programmes aimed at further reducing future maintenance
requirements and improving reliability.

The goal of the large scale maintenance (LSM) programme is to:

meet safety requirements (bogies, brakes, couplings, batteries, and so on);

restore and improve the reliability of systems that have reached about a third or half of their overall lifespan (canopies,
hydraulics on single deck loaders, and so on);

extend the life of wagons (Breda floors, Arbel floors, and so on); and

ensure customer comfort (air conditioning, toilets, interiors, and so on).

In November 2017, commercial capacity was reduced for a short period in order to increase maintenance operations
temporarily in response to abnormal Shuttle fleet wheel wear discovered during routine maintenance.

**d)** **Maintenance strategy**

In order to optimise its infrastructure maintenance, the Group is working on a plan to spend only one night per week (instead
of two as at present) on the maintenance of the two rail tunnels, thanks to predictive maintenance tools. To this end, there
is a project to develop a measurement train specifically for use in the Tunnel. It will circulate each week and deliver a very
accurate assessment of the condition of the track, catenary and other equipment, which should eliminate the need for long
visual inspections on foot.

The process of optimising the rolling stock maintenance strategy aims to:

improve the availability, performance and quality of the Shuttles;

increase processing capacity and so minimise the total cost of maintenance; and

rationalise technical choices and industrial resources.

This process is based on several lines of work:

optimisation of the organisation of the maintenance of Truck Shuttles in order to make available for commercial service
an additional Shuttle during the week and to handle the increase in kilometres travelled;

the technical redesign of maintenance on systems with a high impact on performance and quality, focusing on the
relevance of maintenance instructions and the implementation of appropriate LSM programmes; and

the optimisation of key processes such as corrective maintenance, re-profiling and axle replacement, with improvement
in the efficiency of human, industrial and IT resources.

The Fixed Link’s digital vision includes two elements that directly relate to maintenance:

Optimise infrastructure and rolling stock management through data analysis: increase the reliability and availability of
infrastructure and rolling stock through predictive maintenance, digitisation of teams on the ground and optimisation of
planning schedules.

Build a global platform to enable collection, visualisation, analysis and prediction from reliable and secure data,
accessible to all, in real time.

**e)** **Projects**

Various other initiatives should increase the reliability and efficiency of the System including the three third-generation Truck
Shuttles which were delivered in 2017. These new Shuttles benefit from improvements stemming from feedback from the
Group.

More broadly, as part of a collaborative dynamic, the Group decided to define and direct the Fixed Link strategy for the next
five years, identifying issues and challenges and deciding on goals for the five-year plan.

As part of this improved performance over the long term, several working groups have been set up to bring together broad
transverse and collaborative themes, including:

Fluidity of the terminals: the project aims to reduce the time between a customer arriving on site and boarding a
Passenger or Truck Shuttle.

Improvement of the availability of the rolling stock as specified in section 1.2.4.c) of this Registration Document.

Site security: additional measures were installed in 2016 to further reinforce site and customer safety.

Customer experience: as indicated in section 1.2.2.a)ii) of this Registration Document.

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

Improvement of the availability of the infrastructure as indicated in section 1.2.4.a) of this Registration Document.

Human resources and safety, as indicated in chapter 6 of this Registration Document.

Revenue optimisation, such as the creation of flexible pricing according to Truck Shuttle load factors during peak periods.

**1.3** **EUROPORTE ACTIVITIES**

**_1.3.1 EUROPORTE’S MAIN MARKETS_**

According to figures published by the French Ministère de la Transition Écologique et Solidaire, French rail freight volumes
totalled 32.6 billion tonne kilometres in 2016, down 5% compared to 2015 (34.3 billion tonne kilometres). Against this
background, Europorte transported 1.7 billion tonne kilometres in 2017, stable compared to 2016, representing an estimated
market share of approximately 5%.

**_1.3.2 EUROPORTE ACTIVITIES_**

Thanks to its dense coverage in France, Europorte is positioned as a growth vehicle for the Group, present across the entire
rail freight transport logistical chain, from collecting and routing on primary and secondary networks (Europorte France) or
loading and unloading of wagons on private branch lines on industrial sites (Socorail), to managing rail infrastructure (ports,
private and public/private industrial sites) in France and also in Belgium. Europorte is developing its various complementary
activities concurrently in order to offer its customers complete and customised solutions that meet their expectations for
integrated logistics chains and high quality of service.

Revenue generated by Europorte’s activities in 2017 increased by 2% compared to 2016 to €118 million, stimulated by
growth in the transport of chemical products.

**a)** **Europorte France (EPF)**

Europorte France is a private rail company that offers its customers a service hauling freight trains throughout the railway
network. Every day, EPF carries out main line rail haulage operations 24 hours a day and seven days a week throughout
France with connections to neighbouring European countries, in partnership or as an open access operator, particularly in
Belgium where EPF has railway authorisations (licence and certificate).

For its operations, which averaged around 166 commercial trains per week in 2017, EPF has a fleet of 74 main line electric
and diesel locomotives interoperable with neighbouring European countries. They are used on average by 268 drivers and
operators authorised for safety operations on the French railway network and, in some cases, in Belgium.

EPF has designed its operating model based on six key parameters, specifically with a view to serving its private industrial
customers:

optimisation of transport plans based on regular paths;

organisation of the rail businesses through regional hubs;

guaranteed service through the provision of reliable human and other resources dedicated to traffic;

regular and punctual delivery of goods;

safety on customers’ private branch lines and on the national railway network; and

communication on the status of customers’ freight traffic.

Europorte transports all types of goods, with the exception of explosive, nuclear and biological materials. Its entire operating
system is designed in accordance with the rules on transporting dangerous goods in order to maximise the safety of its
operations. In 2016, Europorte launched two major transport contracts in the petrochemical sector: transport of potash for a
German mining company and the transport of chemicals for a French petroleum group. 2017 was a continuation of 2016
with a consolidation of its petrochemical and cement segments as illustrated by the gain of a vinyl chloride monomer traffic
contract between France and Belgium and the start of the transport of clinker for a French cement group and limestone for
a Belgian industrial group.

EPF has continued to diversify the goods that it transports in order to balance out the risk of seasonal fluctuations in the
volumes transported. EPF has also continued to consolidate its rail business along France’s north/south corridor through its
hubs at Lérouville, Dijon, Lyon, Fos/Marseille and Toulouse. EPF continued to develop its range of one-off services (spot
trains) which it started in 2013, as well as offering specific services in response to the needs of customers in the agri food
and automotive sectors to meet growing demand from rail freight customers for seasonal transport requirements.

All main line locomotives are equipped with GPS positioning and exchange all relevant technical data with the operating and
maintenance teams. The command post agents are able to display on tablets the position of the train, its schedule in relation
to its paths, the battery condition and the amount of fuel in its tank. In turn, drivers are gradually being equipped with tablets
incorporating driving documents, traffic information, alert reports and so on.

Europorte France continues to provide cross-Chanel rail freight services (which represents only a very minor part of its
activity). Like all Railway Companies, Europorte pays the charge for the use of the Fixed Link for any crossing through the
Tunnel, as explained in section 1.2.2.b) of this Registration Document.


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

**b)** **Socorail**

For more than 40 years, Socorail has been providing internal logistical services on industrial sites: wagon handling
operations, track maintenance, loading and unloading of wagons and trucks, and operations on ships. Socorail’s activities
cover a range of services to industry, mainly involving dispatch and reception of raw, semi-finished or finished products, and
management of rail infrastructure:

the management of branched terminal installations including reception, handling and dispatch of loaded or unloaded
wagons and the associated administrative processing;

loading or unloading wagons, particularly tank wagons;

terminal rail services in port zones and on the French railway network;

the provision of rail haulage engines on a full service basis;

track maintenance;

traffic management of rail networks at various ports;

the management of front offices and loading tracks for tank wagons;

the operation of the port terminal for an oil refinery; and

ancillary activities.

Socorail works at around 40 industrial sites and seven ports, including around 20 sites classified as SEVESO II in the oil,
chemicals, steel making, automotive and construction materials sectors. Socorail is MASE and ISO 9001 certified. Present
throughout France, Socorail manages wagons, trucks and operations on ships and port infrastructure.

Socorail offers a service to rail infrastructure managers consisting of traffic management and railway maintenance. In 2016
and 2017, all the large French ports have renewed or confirmed their delegated port management contracts which have
arrived at their term with Socorail, with the exception of the port at Rouen. In 2017, the company was the successful bidder
for two calls for tender for rail infrastructure management contracts of feeder lines in the Hauts-de-France and eastern
France. At the same time, the company is pursuing its efforts to explore and develop its logistics business on industrial sites.

The delegated port infrastructure management sector is Socorail’s largest business, accounting for 36% of its 2017 revenue,
followed by oil/hydrocarbon refining with 16%. Chemicals and services to port terminals contributed 15% and 11%,
respectively.

**c)** **Europorte Proximité (EPP)**

Europorte Proximité focuses on its maintenance activity for low-power diesel locomotives used by Europorte France and
Socorail.

**d)** **Bourgogne Fret Service (BFS)**

Europorte, in partnership with its customer Cérévia, (union of agricultural cooperatives), developed its operations as a freight
forwarder mostly of grain transport. Bourgogne Fret Services, initially a joint venture with Cérévia, was taken over 100% by
EPF, and in 2017 EPF, as sole shareholder, decided to dissolve BFS and carry on the activity itself.

**e)** **Europorte TCSO (EPTCSO)**

At the beginning of 2016, Europorte created a subsidiary Europorte Terminal Container du Sud Ouest, in order to manage
the container terminal at the Grand Port Maritime in Bordeaux, which, as explained in section 3.2.1 of this Registration
Document, will now not happen.

**1.4** **ELECLINK**

The ElecLink project involves the installation of a new electricity interconnector between the French and British grids. This
will enable the import and export of electricity from one country to the other with a bi-directional transport capacity of 1,000
MW via a high-voltage direct current cable installed in the north rail tunnel under the Channel.

In 2014, ElecLink obtained a regulatory derogation granted by the French Energy Regulation Commission (CRE) and its UK
equivalent, the Office of Gas and Electricity (Ofgem). This regulatory derogation was also approved by the European
Commission.

Project construction formally commenced at the end of 2016 and ElecLink awarded the construction work to leading
companies: Siemens is building the converter stations in France and the United Kingdom and Balfour Beatty/Prysmian were
chosen to manufacture and install the direct current cables in the Tunnel and the underground alternating current cable in
the United Kingdom. RTE is responsible for providing and installing the underground alternating current cable in France.

As indicated in chapter 3 of this Registration Document, the construction, as with any new project, carries risks linked to its
technical implementation and compliance with performance levels as well as the commissioning schedule, all within a
regulatory context that may change.

The safety of the project, both in terms of construction safety and the operational safety of the cable in the Tunnel, is
paramount to the Group and is the subject of detailed ongoing monitoring by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority (CTSA)
of the IGC.


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

At the date of this Registration Document, the project construction works are progressing in line with the initial time and
forecasts. The same is true for the regulatory and commercial preparations in readiness for entry into commercial service in
2020, with certification applications submitted before operations begin to the French regulator (CRE) and to the UK regulator
(Ofgem).

The investment in this project is described in section 1.6 of this Registration Document.

ElecLink successfully took part in a capacity auction organised from 6 to 8 February 2018 in the United Kingdom and won
a capacity contract for the period October 2021 to September 2022. Following this first participation, ElecLink now has
confirmed annual revenues for this period of approximately £5.8 million (2016/17 values). These additional revenues will
complement the main source of ElecLink’s revenue namely that arising from the marketing of its interconnector capacity
(congestion rents) which will be the main source of ElecLink’s revenue.

**1.5** **OTHER ACTIVITIES**

**Euro Carex**

The Group is involved in the Euro Carex project via its subsidiary London Carex Limited. The Paris Charles de Gaulle, Lyon
Saint Exupéry and Liège airports linked up with logistics companies including FedEx, TNT and La Poste to try to encourage
a transfer of air freight onto the European high-speed railway network. London Carex is part of this umbrella organisation,
the Euro Carex Association, tasked with developing the British end of the network. The Carex concept is similar to a cargo
aircraft running on rail: high-speed trains that have been modified to carry air freight containers. In 2017, the association
launched a tender for a European business plan. The study began in 2017 and will be completed in 2018. Initial contacts
made in Germany were continued. In November, London Carex suspended its participation in Euro Carex pending the
outcome of Brexit negotiations.

**1.6** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND MAJOR INVESTMENTS**

**_1.6.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT_**

As at 31 December 2017, the Group owns or uses the following property, plant, equipment and other moveable assets set
out in note F to the consolidated financial statements contained in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

The Group’s Concession property, plant and equipment comprise the land and installations required for the operation of the
Tunnel pursuant to the Concession Agreement in France and the United Kingdom. It includes the railway infrastructure
(tunnels, tracks, fixed equipment, rolling stock, roads, networks and so on), the Passenger and Truck Service terminals and
the office buildings in Coquelles and Folkestone, as well as various maintenance buildings and workshops.

In France, all property assets cited in the Concession Agreement are owned by the French State and will revert to it upon
expiry of the Concession period in 2086. In the United Kingdom, the government required CTG to transfer to it the title to
freehold land and property acquired for the construction and operation of the Tunnel and in exchange granted leases for the
duration of the Concession Agreement.

Upon expiry of the Concession Agreement, the interests of CTG and FM (in their capacity as Concessionaires) in all
moveable property and intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of the Tunnel pursuant to the Concession
Agreement will become, without consideration, the joint property of the two States.

Other property, plant and equipment is principally composed of the rolling stock fleet belonging to Europorte and its
subsidiaries as well as the work in progress for the ElecLink project to install the electricity interconnector in the Tunnel. As
set out in notes A.2 and C.2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document,
the ferries owned by the Euro-Transmanche companies were sold in 2017. In addition, the Group owns various plots of land
as part of its property development activities, described in section 1.2.2.c)ii) of this Registration Document.

Moveable assets owned by the Group comprise mainly office equipment, IT equipment, vehicles and furniture.

Investments are described in section 1.6.2 below.

The security interests in the Group’s fixed and moveable assets granted in connection with the Term Loan are described in
section 8.1.4 of this Registration Document and in note G.1.1 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this
Registration Document.

**_1.6.2 MAJOR INVESTMENTS_**

**a)** **Main investments over the last three years**

The Group’s investments in the last three years total €140 million for the 2015 financial year, €150 million for the 2016
financial year and €262 million for the 2017 financial year.

Over the last three financial years, the Group has invested more than €219 million in the Fixed Link, including:

the purchase of three new Truck Shuttles (approximately €42 million over the three financial years) brought into
commercial service in 2017. This project concerned the construction of three new Truck Shuttles each measuring 800
metres in length and comprising 32 transport wagons and three loader wagons;

the Terminal 2015 project (approximately €23 million over the last three financial years), as part of a programme to
develop the Truck Shuttle activity including the creation at Coquelles of two additional toll lanes and of a “buffer storage”


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

area allowing for fluid and rapid transit and at Folkestone, the creation of a new toll area with five new lanes dedicated
to Truck Shuttle traffic;

the installation of GSM-R (approximately €50 million since the beginning of the project, including €13 million over the
last three financial years);

finalisation of the security improvements on the French terminal through the use of appropriate measures, including the
installation of more than 30km of 4 metre high security fencing protected by detection cables on the fences themselves
or buried underground, 9km of infra-red barriers, the installation of 600 video cameras (day and night), the construction
of a new security control centre capable of monitoring up to 1,500 alarms, the purchase of a further two X-ray scanners
(for vans and railway traffic), the construction of a building fitted with a heartbeat detection system to detect human
presence on trucks and a rail siding, a large part of which is reimbursed by the British government;

the replacement of rails in the Tunnel (approximately €11 million);

the construction and fit-out of a new lounge for Flexiplus customers at each terminal (approximately €10 million); the
lounge at the French terminal was inaugurated in 2017 and that at the British terminal will be open to customers in 2018;

the replacement of couplings on the rolling stock (approximately €8 million);

the strengthening of the electrical traction network by building a new booster converter twice as powerful as the existing
one (approximately €5 million) in a project to be completed over the next two years; and

the replacement of the units of the Tunnel’s cooling plants and air conditioning that use R22 gas (about €5 million) as
described in chapter 6 of this Registration Document.

Over the last three years, the Group’s investments in the Europorte segment have totalled approximately €92 million, mainly
related to the purchase of rolling stock for the ongoing rationalisation of the locomotive fleet, notably locomotives for
Europorte France as well as for GB Railfreight before its sale on 15 November 2016.

On 23 August 2016, the Group acquired Star Capital’s 51% holding in the ElecLink Limited joint venture for €75 million, the
rationale for development being based on its capacity to diversify the Group’s activity in order to optimise the existing
infrastructure of the Tunnel. Since its full integration into the Group on 23 August 2016 and up to 31 December 2017, the
Group’s investment in the ElecLink project has amounted to €239 million.

**b)** **Major future investments**

Investment projects planned for 2018 fall into two categories: projects to replace existing equipment before it becomes
obsolete and projects to improve the quality of service. Each project has a degree of flexibility in terms of scope and phasing
which may be adjusted as circumstances change.

In the current economic environment and given the risk of increased competition in the cross-Channel market, these
investments are for the most part essential to sustaining the competitiveness and market shares of the Fixed Link’s activities.

In 2018, replacement projects mainly concern rolling stock. Intensive use and the natural life cycle of rolling stock lead to
deterioration in some of the wagon equipment. To remedy this, several modernisation and replacement programmes have
been launched, such as the Passenger Shuttle renovation programme which will focus in particular on loader wagons, the
fire detection and fire-fighting system and the air conditioning units. The Breda Truck Shuttle renewal programme will also
commence this year. For infrastructure maintenance, a replacement programme will be launched for the fleet of shunting
engines that pull work trains in the Tunnel for maintenance activities, as will studies for a maintenance train to measure track
parameters.

As part of service quality improvement measures, the programme to improve the electrical power supply will continue with
the installation of the new boost converter and an increase in the catenary capacity with the addition of high-voltage coaxial
cables. In 2017, the Group launched the Freight Traffic Management System project which is aimed at providing
comprehensive real-time monitoring of each truck from before check-in and right up until loading in order to optimise traffic
flows whilst providing drivers and hauliers with accurate real-time information.

More generally, the continuation of the digital transformation programme aims to bring greater transparency to traffic flows,
improve the customer experience and optimise maintenance management with increasingly efficient hypervision tools.

The external costs of constructing the ElecLink project are estimated at €580 million at the current exchange rate,
corresponding to the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts to provide technological architecture
solutions and the construction for the project, the study and realisation of connections to national grids and project
management, as described in sections 1.4 and 1.6.2 of this Registration Document (excluding payments to the Group,
contingent liabilities and operating costs).

As set out in note A.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements as set out in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document,
the Group signed a commitment on 29 December 2017 to acquire some of the index-linked bonds issued by Channel Link
Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF) in 2007. On 9 February 2018, the Group concluded this transaction and acquired all CLEF’s
G2 bonds. This transaction was carried out by a British subsidiary of the Group, Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited, and
was partly financed by an external loan of £190 million.

**Sources of funds for future investments**

The main future investments for the Fixed Link are expected to be self-funded. As at 31 December 2017, the balance on
the “Capex Reserve” account earmarked to finance long-term investment projects such as those described above, was £8
million.

Acquisitions of rolling stock for Europorte may be funded by external loans or sale and leaseback transactions.


-----

###### PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES

With regard to the investment in the ElecLink project, the Group seeks to retain the financing structure that is best adapted
to the Group’s financing strategy and to the constraints and the opportunities of the project.

As indicated in sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of this Registration Document, the Group has cash balances of more than €600
million at 31 December 2017 and, under normal conditions, the Group generates a Free Cash Flow of more than €200
million per year.

The Group seeks to preserve as long as possible the flexibility offered by the strength of its balance sheet, with the aim of
minimising the cost of financing and optimising the profitability of the project. With this in mind, the Group has decided, for
the time being, to finance the project internally using its own funds for all or part of it. The Group remains attentive and is
continuing to explore different financing possibilities for the project according to the optimal proportion of the transmission
capacity of the interconnector on the basis of medium-term contracts.

As indicated in note A.1 to the consolidated financial statements set out in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document, the
Group completed in 2017 and at the beginning of 2018 two important steps of its strategy to optimise its financial structure,
and the financing of the ElecLink project forms an integral part of this.

The project involves significant construction works in 2018 and 2019 and then revenues from 2020. Given these specific
constraints, the estimated income profile (either capacity auction or “merchant” models) and the macroeconomic conditions
(base rates, energy market conditions in France and the United Kingdom) are elements that are integrated into the different
financing scenarios.

**_1.6.3 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENCES_**

**a)** **Research and development**

The Group focuses its research and development policy on increasing the reliability of its infrastructure and rolling stock as
well as on improving traffic flow at its terminals, while strengthening customer safety.

The Group has launched a study programme to design a new generation of Truck Shuttles. This comprehensive research
programme is based on the success of innovative projects such as the design of new superstructures on its Truck Shuttles
and the redesign of new floors with outstanding fire-retardant characteristics. This research and development project should
enable the Group to significantly increase the performance of its Shuttles while still reducing as many of the constraints as
possible resulting from a rapid change in traffic levels and the consequences in terms of maintenance. Full-scale tests and
studies conducted together with companies known for their technical expertise have made it possible to design reliable
solutions that are adapted to the operating conditions of the Channel Tunnel.

In order to deal with ever increasingly intense operational issues specific to it, the Group has initiated a research programme
to develop a new sleeper block (the piece of concrete on which the rail is laid) which is stronger and so more able to meet
the demands of increased traffic. This project uses internal resources and those of external partners, whose railway and
materials expertise provides a better understanding of the phenomena and enables the development of innovative solutions
to overcome identified technical issues. This project is also the result of the endowment of a research professorship for
railway transport sciences set up by the Group at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (ENPC), aimed at researching
technological developments in infrastructure, life-cycle analysis, the design of intelligent rail systems and understanding the
phenomena of density.

In parallel, the work conducted with ENPC has led to the development of a new solution for inspecting sleeper blocks thanks
to a method measuring vibrational frequencies. The objective is to create an automated carriage enabling fast sleeper block
inspection.

The Group is also a founding member of the board of the French Fondation de Coopération Scientifique Railenium (a
foundation for scientific cooperation). Railenium is an institute for technological research in the rail industry, selected within
the framework of France’s economic stimulus plan (the “Grand Emprunt”). It is composed of a Foundation for Scientific
Cooperation and a test centre. Railenium’s mission is to provide a platform for rail infrastructure research and development,
testing, engineering and training. The Foundation pools the work of research bodies and companies to develop research
and development programmes in the field of rail infrastructure and systems, which may go as far as industrial prototyping.
The Foundation’s partners include seven research and training organisations, 15 industrial companies involved in
construction, services and engineering, and three infrastructure operators (SNCF Réseau, SNCF and the Group). Two
research and development projects were born out of this organisation in 2016 and will continue in the upcoming years: the
development of an innovative solution for the remote monitoring of track devices and the designing of a maintenance train
that makes it possible to check many parameters simultaneously such as the condition of the rail, signalling and the catenary,
all whilst circulating at high speed without disturbing the commercial operation of the Channel Tunnel.

Concerned with guaranteeing optimal safety for its customers while still optimising traffic flow through its terminals, the
Group is devoting substantial research and development effort to designing an innovative solution for detecting over-height
truck antennas upstream of the boarding platforms. In collaboration with companies that are experts in acoustic and sound
solutions, the purpose of this project is to detect any antenna that exceeds the regulatory height for Truck Shuttles regardless
of the speed at which the truck is travelling (up to the speeds limits authorised at the terminals) and the position of the
antenna. Prototypes have been installed at various strategic points of passage along the customer’s path in order to
rigorously determine the most reliable solution.

Finally, the Group has adopted an ambitious digital plan, with a view to making its exchanges with customers, employees
and partners even more fluid and personal in the interests of improving the customer experience. Built around the Group's
customers, employees and partners, this plan aims to integrate and rethink the place of digitalisation throughout the
customer journey, improve the offer to customers and continue its development.

**2.1** **ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS**

Pursuant to EC Regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards, the
consolidated financial statements of Groupe Eurotunnel SE for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union at 31
December 2017.

The following information relating to Groupe Eurotunnel SE’s financial situation and consolidated results must be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements set out in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

The main factors with an impact on revenue are described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Registration Document.

**_2.1.1 ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT_**

In order to enable a better comparison between the two years, the 2016 consolidated income statement presented in this
section has been recalculated at the exchange rate used for the 2017 income statement of £1=€1.140.

During the first half of 2016, the Group’s 49% share in ElecLink Limited’s result (a loss of €1 million for the 49% holding)
was accounted for in the consolidated income statement under “Share of result of equity-accounted companies”. Since the
purchase by the Group of Star Capital’s 51% holding in ElecLink Limited on 23 August 2016, ElecLink Limited has been fully
consolidated in the Group’s accounts.

The Group has applied IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” to its maritime segment
since the cessation of MyFerryLink’s operations in the second half of 2015 and to GB Railfreight’s activity since its sale in
November 2016. Accordingly, the net results of these activities for the current and previous financial years are presented as
a single line in the income statement called “Net profit from discontinued operations”.

For more information on these operations, see notes A.2 and C.2.1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in
section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

**a)** **Summary**

In 2017, the Group’s consolidated revenues amounted to €1,033 million, an increase of €36 million (4%) compared to 2016.
Operating costs totalled €507 million, an increase of €4 million compared to 2016. EBITDA improved by €32 million (6%) to
€526 million and the trading profit improved by €30 million to €374 million. At €365 million, the operating profit for 2017 was
down by €16 million compared to 2016 which benefited from the €50 million profit arising from the full consolidation of
ElecLink. Net finance costs increased by €16 million as a result of the impact of higher British and French inflation rates on
the index-linked tranche of the debt. Other net financial charges in 2017 include a provision of €55 million in respect of the
undertaking concluded in December 2017 to acquire inflation-linked bonds (see note A.1.2 to the consolidated accounts).
The pre-tax result for the Group’s continuing operations for the 2017 financial year was a profit of €52 million, a reduction of
€89 million compared to 2016 restated.

After taking into account a tax income of €56 million, the net result for the continuing activities of the Group was a profit of
€108 million compared to a profit of €124 million in 2016. The Group’s net consolidated result for 2017 was a profit of €113
million compared to a net profit of €188 million in 2016 which included a gain of €50 million arising from the integration of
ElecLink and a €64 million net profit arising from discontinued operations.

**b)** **Fixed Link Concession segment**

The Group’s core business is the Channel Tunnel Fixed Link Concession which operates and directly markets its Shuttle
Services and also provides access, on payment of a toll, for the circulation of High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar) and
the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Trains through its Railway Network. This segment also includes the Group’s corporate
services.

**i.** **Fixed Link Concession revenue**

Revenue generated by this segment, which in 2017 represented 89% of the Group’s total revenue, increased by 4%
compared to 2016, to €915 million.

_Shuttle Services_

**Traffic (number of vehicles)** **2017** **2016** **Change**

Truck Shuttle 1,637,280 1,641,638 0%

Passenger Shuttle:

Cars * 2,595,247 2,610,242 -1%

Coaches 51,229 53,623 -4%

_*_ _Includes motorcycles, vehicles with trailers, caravans and motor homes._

Shuttle Services’ revenue for 2017 amounted to €604 million, up 3% compared to the previous year mainly due to an
increase in yields which have benefited from the Group's strategy of optimising the profitability of its Shuttle business through
its dynamic pricing policy for both truck and passenger traffic.

**Truck Shuttle**

The Short Straits cross-Channel truck market was stable in 2017 compared to the previous year. In 2017, the number of
trucks transported by the Truck Shuttles and their market share (39.1%) remained at the same level as in 2016. Truck
Shuttle traffic and market share were both affected by the decrease in fresh fruit and vegetable traffic due to the exceptionally
bad weather conditions in southern Europe at the beginning of 2017 and in November by a reduction in capacity due to a
temporary increase in maintenance operations. Despite these factors, a number of traffic records were set with five record
months compared to the same months in previous years and a record second half of the year.

**Passenger Shuttle**

In a Short Straits cross-Channel market in slight contraction in 2017 (approximately 0.2%), car market share remained
relatively stable at 54.9%. Compared to 2016, cross-Channel car traffic in 2017 was affected by non-recurring events
including the Euro football tournament in 2016 and elections in France and the UK in 2017.

The Short Straits cross-Channel coach market contracted by approximately 7.0% in 2017 but the Passenger Shuttle’s coach
market share increased by a point compared to the previous year, to 39.1%.

_Brussels-Calais, Brussels-Lille, etc.)._
_**_ _Rail freight services by train operators (DB Cargo for BRB, SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Rail Operations Group and Europorte) using the_
_Tunnel._

The Group earned revenues of €293 million in 2017 from the use of its Railway Network by Eurostar’s High-Speed
Passenger Trains and by the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services, up 4% compared to 2016.

The number of Eurostar passengers using the Tunnel increased by 3% in 2017 compared to the previous year, thanks to a
strong recovery since the series of terrorist attacks.

In 2017, cross-Channel rail freight continued the trend seen at the end of 2016, with strong growth of 12% compared to the
previous year as a result of additional traffic generated by the good quality of service delivered since the beginning of 2016
and by the work carried out by the Group and other concerned parties to re-launch this traffic following the disruptions to
services caused by the migrant crisis and the loss of half of its customers and traffic during the autumn of 2015 which
diverted to other commercial routes.

**ii.** **Fixed Link Concession operating costs**

The Fixed Link segment’s operating costs amounted to €394 million in 2017, an increase of only 2% compared to 2016. This
€8 million increase was due mainly to increased activity and maintenance costs.

**c)** **Europorte segment**

The Europorte segment covers the entire rail freight transport logistics chain in France and includes notably Europorte
France and Socorail. The UK subsidiary GB Railfreight Limited was sold in November 2016.

In 2017, Europorte’s revenues increased by 2% compared to 2016 and operating costs decreased by 3%. EBITDA increased
by a substantial €6 million thanks to the plan to sustainably reinforce the profitability of this segment launched by the Group
in 2016.

**d)** **ElecLink segment**

ElecLink’s activity is the construction and operation of a 1,000 MW electricity interconnector between the UK and France.
Construction works began in the second half of 2016 and the interconnector is expected to be in commercial operation at
the beginning of 2020.

Costs directly attributable to the project are capitalised. Investment on the project during 2017 amounted to €181 million.

Operating costs for 2017 amounted to €1 million.

At €526 million in 2017, the Group’s operating margin improved by €32 million compared to 2016 (+6%) as a result of an
increase in revenue, control of the Fixed Link’s costs and improved profitability of the Europorte segment. Europorte’s
EBITDA improved by €6 million thanks to the plan to sustainably reinforce the profitability of this segment.

**f)** **Operating profit (EBIT)**

Depreciation charges increased by €2 million to €152 million compared to 2016 as a result of the completion in 2016 and
2017 of capital investment projects such as Terminal 2015 and the GSM-R.

At €374 million in 2017, the trading profit improved by €30 million (9%) compared to 2016.

In 2016, other net operating income of €37 million included a gain of €50 million resulting from the revaluation at their fair
value of the shares in ElecLink Limited already held by the Group when it took full control of the subsidiary in August 2016
partially offset by provisions and advisors’ fees.

In the absence of this one-off gain, the operating profit for the 2017 financial year was down by €16 million (4%) compared
to 2016, to €365 million.

**g)** **Net financial charges**

At €270 million for 2017, net finance costs increased by €16 million compared to 2016 at a constant exchange rate, mainly
as a result of the impact of the increase in inflation rates in the UK and France on the index-linked tranches of the debt
partially offset by the capitalisation of interest on the financing of the ElecLink project amounting to €9 million.

“Other net financial charges” in 2017 of €43 million include a provision of €55 million in respect of the undertaking concluded
in December 2017 to acquire inflation-linked bonds (see note A.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements set out in section
2.2.1 of this Registration Document), net exchange gains of €10 million and interest received on the floating rate notes held
by the Group of €3 million, as well as a net charge of €2 million arising from the partial refinancing of the Group’s debt
concluded in June 2017 (see notes A.1.1 and G.1.1.a to the consolidated financial statements set out in section 2.2.1 of this
Registration Document) consisting of:

   a profit of €14 million from the redemption of the floating rate notes held by the Group,

   a net gain of €12 million after termination costs arising from the partial termination of the hedging contracts resulting from
the favourable conditions negotiated with the counterparties to the contracts,

   a charge of €21 million corresponding to the outstanding unamortised balance of the fees and costs on the debt that was
extinguished as a result of the refinancing, and

   costs of €7 million for the refinancing operation which are not attributable to the issue of the new debt.

**h)** **Net result from continuing operations**

The Group’s pre-tax result for continuing operations for the 2017 financial year was a profit of €52 million, a reduction of €89
million compared to 2016 at a constant exchange rate.

In 2017, income tax net income amounted to €56 million and included an income of €9 million following the French
authorities’ cancellation of tax on dividends and a deferred tax income of €50 million mainly arising from the activation of an
additional two years of deficits.

The Group’s post-tax result for continuing operations for the 2017 financial year was a profit of €108 million, a reduction of
€16 million at a constant exchange rate.

The table above summarises the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 and 31
December 2016. The main elements and changes between the two dates are as follows:

“Fixed assets” include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounting to €6,016 million for the Fixed
Link segment, €396 million for the ElecLink segment (including €181 million in 2017) and €81 million for the Europorte
segment at 31 December 2017. The increase between 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 results mainly from
investment in the ElecLink project.


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

   “Other non-current assets” include a deferred tax asset of €217 million, an increase of €96 million compared to December
2016 of which €50 million relates to the hedging contracts and €52 million relates to the activation of tax losses (see note
I.2.1 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017). The floating rate notes held by the
Group and amounting to €151 million at 31 December 2016, were redeemed as part of the partial debt refinancing
operation completed on 6 June 2017.

   At 31 December 2016, “Other current assets” included receivables relating to the finance lease contracts for the maritime
segment’s three ferries. During 2017, the Group exercised the put options that were included in the contracts signed with
the lessees and completed the sales of the three ferries. These transactions, which gave rise to a receipt by the Group
of a total of €116 million, are reflected in the consolidated accounts by the settlement of receivables recognised in respect
of their finance leases (see note A.2 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 for further
details).

   At 31 December 2017, “Cash and cash equivalents” amounted to €613 million after payment of the €139 million dividend,
net capital expenditure of €277 million, €230 million in debt service costs (interest, repayments and fees) as well as a
net amount of €259 million generated by the refinancing operation completed in June 2017 (see notes A.1.1 and G.1.1.a
to Group’s consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 for further details) and the receipt of €116 million
from the sale of the ferries.

   “Equity” increased by €239 million as a result of the favourable change in the valuation of the “Interest rate derivatives”
liability on the hedging contracts and related deferred tax (€177 million), the evolution of the cumulative translation
reserve (€57 million) and the net profit for the year (€113 million) partly offset by the impact of the dividend payment
(€139 million).

   “Financial liabilities” have increased by €560 million compared to 31 December 2016 as a result of the €602 million
additional debt raised by the operation to partially refinance the Term Loan concluded on 6 June 2017 and an increase
of €48 million arising from the effect of inflation on the index-linked debt tranches of the Term Loan partially offset by the
effect of the reduction in the exchange rate on the sterling-denominated debt (€65 million) and the contractual debt
repayments of €26 million.

   “Interest rate derivatives” decreased by €593 million mainly as a result of the partial termination of the hedging contracts
(€502 million) and a reduction of €88 million in the mark-to-market valuation of the contracts.

   “Other liabilities” include €304 million of trade and other payables and provisions, as well as retirement liabilities of €74
million.

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**i.** **Continuing activities**

At €540 million in 2017, net cash generated from trading by continuing operations improved by €23 million compared to
2016 at a constant exchange rate (€517 million restated). This change is explained mainly by:

an increase in activities relating to the Fixed Link to €531 million (2016: €516 million), and

an increase in Europorte activities to €9 million (2016: €2 million).

ElecLink expenditure remains stable at €1 million (2016: €1 million).

The €23 million improvement in “Other operating cash flows and taxation” is composed of a €20 million favourable variance
related to taxes (including €8 million in respect of the cancelling of the dividend tax and €12 million in respect of corporation
tax) as well as a €3 million reduction in other net operating charges.

At €275 million in 2017, net cash payments from investing activities increased by €74 million, comprising mainly:

€78 million relating to the Fixed Link (2016: €67 million). The main expenditure was €39 million on rolling stock (including
€24 million on the three new Truck Shuttles which entered service in February, August and October 2017), €10 million
for “Customer Experience” (including the new Flexiplus buildings) and €5 million on the GSM-R project, and

an investment of €196 million in the construction works on the ElecLink project which started in the second half of 2016
(€51 million in 2016).

On 6 June 2017, the Group completed the partial refinancing of its debt. This operation covered the C tranches of the Term
Loan, the variable rate tranches that were fully hedged by fixed rate interest swaps (see notes A.1 and G.1 to the
consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017 for further details). This operation generated net cash totalling
€259 million comprising:

a net receipt of €602 million being the difference between the drawdown of the new tranches (€1,950 million) and the
reimbursement of the old C tranches (€1,347 million),

a receipt of €164 million from the redemption of the floating rate notes held by the Group, and

fees paid in relation to the partial break costs on the hedging contracts of €482 million and €25 million in relation to other
costs and fees of the operation.

This operation enables the Group to:

reduce its annual interest payments by some €50 million and its annual financial charges in the income statement by an
estimated €7 million per year for at least the five next years,

decrease the average annual cost excluding indexation of the Term Loan to below 4% for this same period compared to
6% previously, and

raise additional cash of €265 million which could be used to finance the ElecLink project.

The other net financing payments in 2017 amounted to €365 million compared to €446 million in 2016. During 2017, cash
flow from financing comprised:

debt service costs of €230 million:

   - €197 million of interest paid on the Term Loan, associated hedging transactions and on other borrowings (€225
million restated in 2016),

   - €26 million paid in respect of the scheduled repayments on the Term Loan and other borrowings (€36 million in 2016),
and

   - €7 million in relation to fees on the operation to simplify the debt completed at the end of 2015 (€17 million in 2016).

€9 million paid in respect of the share buyback programme (€59 million in 2016),

€139 million paid in dividends (2016: €118 million), and

net receipts of €13 million from the liquidity contract and interest received (including €3 million on the floating rate notes
held by the Group until June 2017).

**ii.** **Discontinued activities**

The cash out flows relating to discontinued operations in 2017 were €1 million from operating activities and a tax payment
of €13 million in respect of the sale of the ferries. The cash flow from discontinued activities includes the €122 million received
under the finance leases and from the sale of the three ferries and a payment of €2 million being the final price adjustment
on the sale of GB Railfreight Limited in 2016.

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

 Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017

_This is a translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements of the company issued in French_
_and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users._

_This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about_
_the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to_
_shareholders._

_This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing_
_standards applicable in France._

To the Shareholders,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying
consolidated financial statements of Groupe Eurotunnel SE for the year ended 31 December 2017.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2017 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

**_Audit framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of
the consolidated financial statements” section of our report.

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 January
2017 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 5(1)
of Regulation (EU) 537/2014 or in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.

**Justification of assessments - key audit matters**

In accordance with the requirements of articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)
relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material
misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

**Goodwill and recoverable amount of tangible and intangible assets**

**Risk identified** **Our response**


Tangible and intangible assets amounted to €6,493 million as of 31
December 2017, compared to a total balance sheet of €7,492 million.

Regarding intangible assets, as indicated in note F.1 of the
consolidated financial statements, in 2017, the Group completed the
allocation of the goodwill that was accounted for on the acquisition of
ElecLink in 2016. This goodwill was fully allocated to an intangible
asset representing the fair value estimate, as at the date of acquisition
of ElecLink in 2016, of the license and the exemption granted to
ElecLink by national regulators in 2013 and 2014.

The Group performed impairment tests on Concession assets,
Europorte assets and ElecLink assets. The procedures for carrying out
these impairment tests are described in note F.3 of the consolidated
financial statements.

The determination of the recoverable value of these assets and
potential losses to be recognised is a key audit matter of the audit
given its significance in the Group’s accounts and the high degree of
estimation and management judgment required regarding
assumptions about operating performance and future traffic, exchange
rates, long-term growth rates, discount rates as well as the sensitivity
of the valuation to these assumptions.


Regarding the allocation of ElecLink’s goodwill:
```
- we reviewed the modality of implementation of the allocation, which

```
was the subject of a report by an independent expert;
```
- we verified the appropriateness of the approach used to determine

```
the fair value of the license and the exemption;
```
- we assessed the reasonableness of the main assumptions used

```
and verified the calculations that led to the determination of this
value;
```
- we assessed the appropriateness of the information given in the

```
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Regarding Concession assets, Europorte assets and ElecLink
assets:
```
- we obtained the Group’s latest strategic plans and the impairment

```
tests performed for Concession assets and ElecLink assets;
```
- we obtained the latest independent expert reports for Europorte

```
assets.
```
- we reviewed the modality of implementation of impairment tests;
- we assessed the reasonableness of the main assumptions, in

```
particular the evolution of operating performance and future traffic
on the basis of the Group's latest business plan, long-term growth
rates and the exchange rate;
```
- we assessed, with the support of our specialists, the discount rates

```
used in their various components;
```
- we verified the calculations that led to the recoverable values

```
determined, as well as the sensitivity analyses performed;
```
- we assessed the appropriateness of the information given in the

```
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**Accounting treatment of transactions completed in the context of the reorganisation of the Term Loan**

**Risk identified** **Our response**


Financial liabilities of €4,287 million and interest rate derivatives of
€716 million are among the largest items in the balance sheet as of 31
December 2017.

As detailed in notes A.1.1 and G.1.1 of the consolidated financial
statements, in June 2017 the Group completed a partial refinancing of
its debt, which related to the C tranches of the Term Loan (the variable
rate tranches that were fully hedged by fixed rate interest swaps). This
transaction included different phases: refinancing of existing tranches,
partial termination of the corresponding hedging contracts, drawing of
new debt tranches and redemption of the floating rate notes issued by
Channel Link Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF).

As mentioned in note A.1.2 of the consolidated financial statements,
the Group concluded an agreement in December 2017, with one of the
holders of the bonds issued by CLEF, to acquire the G2 inflationindexed bonds. The analysis of the terms of the commitment resulted
in the recognition of a provision in accordance with IAS 37, related to
a contribution to the costs incurred by the holder of the bonds. The
transaction was completed on 9 February 2018.

Given the characteristics of the transactions, there is a risk of error in
the accounting treatment that we considered to be a key point of the
audit. The particular points of focus are the qualification of the
refinancing operation, the analysis and treatment of transaction costs,
the treatment of the partial termination of the hedging contracts, the
identification and the accounting translation of the commitment to
purchase the bonds and the information given in the consolidated
financial statements.


Regarding the refinancing operation:

- we reviewed the qualitative and quantitative tests confirming the

qualification of the operation (extinguishment of the debt and
recognition of a new financial liability);

- we verified the analysis and accounting treatment of transaction

costs: residual transaction costs not yet amortised and expenses
incurred on the new debt;

- we reviewed the accounting treatment of the interest rate

derivatives which were amended to suspend their application;

- we checked the documentation of derivative instruments.

Regarding the commitment to acquire index-linked bonds:

- we took note of the agreements reached on 29 December 2017;

- we assessed the commitment made by the Group regarding

IAS 37;

- we verified the calculation of the provision as of 31 December

2017;

- we followed the conclusion of the transaction in accordance with

the terms of the commitment signed on 29 December 2017.

Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the accounting
treatment and the information given in the notes of the consolidated
financial statements.


**Verification of the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report**

As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information
pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the Board of Directors.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**_Appointment of the statutory auditors_**

We were appointed as statutory auditors of Groupe Eurotunnel SE by the annual general meeting held on 9 May 2007.

As at 31 December 2017, audit firms KPMG Audit and Mazars were in the 11th year of total uninterrupted engagement.

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control
and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting
procedures.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

**Statutory auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

**_Objectives and audit approach_**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As specified in article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include
assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises
professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered
to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;

assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt
on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a
going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw
attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures
are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;

evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and

obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion
expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

**_Report to the Audit Committee_**

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit
program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control
regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key
audit matters, that we are required to describe in this audit report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 537/2014, confirming
our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by articles L. 82210 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de
_déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably_
be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

 Notes to the financial statements

Groupe Eurotunnel SE, whose registered office is at 3 rue La Boétie, 75008 Paris, France and whose shares are listed on
Euronext Paris and on NYSE Euronext London, is the Group’s consolidating entity. The term “Groupe Eurotunnel SE” or
“GET SE” refers to the holding company which is governed by French law. The term “Group” refers to Groupe Eurotunnel SE
and all its subsidiaries.

The main activities of the Group are the design, financing, construction and operation of the Fixed Link’s infrastructure and
transport system in accordance with the terms of the Concession (which will expire in 2086), the rail freight activity of the
Europorte segment as well as the construction and operation (expected for the beginning of 2020) of the 1,000 MW electricity
interconnector in the Tunnel by ElecLink. The maritime activity was discontinued in 2015 (see note A.2 below).

The consolidated financial statements were finalised by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2018 and will be submitted
for approval to the shareholders’ general meeting.

###### A. Important events

 A.1 Optimisation of the structure of the debt

During 2017, the Group continued its strategy, begun at the end of 2015, of the optimisation of its debt structure. The
objective of this long-term initiative is to enable the Group to benefit from a financing structure that is more appropriate to its
business and its needs and to realise savings compared to the current cost of its debt. The operations carried out and
committed in 2017 are part of this strategy, which will be pursued in 2018 by the reorganisation of the Group’s legal structure.

**A.1.1 Partial refinancing of the debt in June 2017**

On 6 June 2017, the Group completed the partial refinancing of its debt, which related to the C tranches of the Term Loan
(the variable rate tranches that were fully hedged by fixed rate interest swaps). This operation, whose terms and treatment
in the accounts are set out in notes G.1.1.a and G.5.1 below, comprised:

   the refinancing of tranches C1 and C2 of the Term Loan and the partial termination of the corresponding hedging
contracts,

   the drawing of three new tranches of debt for a total of €602 million (at the exchange rate at 31 December 2017) in order
to finance the cost of the partial termination of the hedging contracts and the costs of the operation, and

   the redemption of the floating rate notes issued by Channel Link Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF) as part of the
securitisation of tranche C of the debt in 2007 and held by the Group.

At 31 December 2017, this operation is reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as follows:

   In accordance with IAS 39, the refinancing of tranches C1 and C2 is accounted for as the extinguishment of the existing
debt and the recognition of a new financial liability, with the recognition in the income statement of the unamortised costs
of tranches C1 and C2 amounting to €21 million.

   The new tranches are recorded at their fair value. Costs of €18 million which are directly attributable to the issue of the
new debt are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying value of the new tranches and will be amortised over its life
using the effective interest rate method.

   Following the partial termination of the hedging contracts, the interest rate derivatives liability in the consolidated balance
sheet was reduced by €502 million which will be recycled from equity to the income statement over the periods of
suspension of the hedging contracts.

   The redemption of the floating rate notes held by the Group and which were previously accounted for as “Other financial
assets”, generated a profit of €14 million which was recognised in the consolidated income statement under “Other
financial income” which corresponds to the portion of the discount realised on their acquisition in 2011 and 2012 that
had not yet been recognised in the income statement.

**A.1.2 Commitment to acquire inflation-linked bonds**

On 29 December 2017, the Group reached an agreement with one of the holders of the bonds issued by CLEF in 2007 in
relation to all the bonds that they held. The agreement provides for:

   the acquisition by the Group of the G2 inflation-indexed bonds which have a nominal value of €150 million,

   options for the Group to purchase the G1 bonds (which have a nominal value of £300 million) and the G3 bonds (which
have a nominal value of £100 million), and

   the Group to be able to put in place the restructuring of its legal structure in 2018.

All the conditions related to the implementation of this commitment having been met, the operation was completed on 9
February 2018.

The Group paid an indemnity of £48 million in respect of the G2 bonds corresponding to a contribution to the costs incurred
by the holder of the bonds. This indemnity was provided for in the consolidated accounts as at 31 December 2017 in
accordance with IAS 37.


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

 A.2 Discontinued operation: maritime segment

Since the cessation of its maritime activity in the second half of 2015, the Group has applied IFRS 5 “Non-current assets
held for sale and discontinued operations” to its maritime segment. Information relating to the maritime segment is presented
in note C.2.1.a below.

**Exercise of the put options for the sale of the ferries**

In June 2015, the Group reached an agreement with the DFDS group in relation to two of the ferries, Berlioz and Rodin
(since renamed Côte des Flandres and Côte des Dunes) and on the 4 May 2016, the Group reached an agreement with
Vansea Shipping Company Limited relating to the Nord-Pas-de-Calais ferry (since renamed AL Andalus Express).

These agreements provided for the lease of the ferries with a put option, exercisable by the Group, for their subsequent
sale. At the start of the lease of the ferries in 2016, the Group recorded them as finance leases in the consolidated balance
sheet for an amount equivalent to the value of the minimum payments receivable.

The Group exercised the put option on the Berlioz and Rodin on 12 June 2017 and on 23 June 2017, completed the sale of
the two ferries to DFDS A/S for the price set out in the agreement made in June 2015. The put option of the Nord-Pas-deCalais was exercised by the Group on 5 July 2017 and the sale was completed on 10 July 2017.

MyFerryLink paid €13 million for maintenance and repair works before the transfer of the Rodin and the Berlioz.

These transactions, through which the Group received €116 million in 2017, are treated in the consolidated financial
statements at 31 December 2017 as a settlement of the finance lease receivables and an income of €15 million was
recognised in the income statement under discontinued activities.

In the context of the exercise of the put option on the Berlioz and Rodin, DFDS notified the Group that it disagreed with the
option exercise price. It has since introduced a claim in arbitration for restitution of part of the purchase price. The Group
considers that the amount paid is what was agreed in the option agreement. The arbitration case will be heard in the second
half of 2018.

###### A.3 ElecLink

ElecLink’s construction works continued in 2017 in accordance with the plan in terms of both cost and timetable. Investment
in the project during 2017 amounted to €181 million, bringing the total investment since the Group took full control of ElecLink
in 2016 to €239 million.

###### B. Principles of preparation, main accounting policies and methods

The consolidated accounts consist of the consolidation of the accounts of GET SE and its subsidiaries as set out in the table
in note C.1 below. The accounting periods of the Group companies run from 1 January to 31 December.

###### B.1 Statement of compliance and Group accounting standards

Pursuant to European Regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 on International Accounting Standards, the Group's
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 are prepared in accordance with international
accounting standards as published by IASB and approved by the European Union as at 31 December 2017. These
international standards include IAS (International Accounting Standards), International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and interpretations (SIC and IFRIC).

The Group has control over the nature and price of the services it provides, and therefore does not meet the criteria set out
in IFRIC 12 relating to concession contracts.

The Group did not anticipate the application of standards and interpretations, the implementation of which is not mandatory
in 2017.

###### B.2 Changes in accounting standards as at 31 December 2017

The accounting policies and valuation rules applied by the Group in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December
2017 are identical to those used in the financial statements as at 31 December 2016.

**B.2.1 Texts adopted by the European Union whose application is compulsory**

The texts adopted by the European Union, the application of which is compulsory for financial years beginning on or after
1 January 2017, are as follows:

amendments to IAS 19 “Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions”;

amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 “Clarification of Acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation”;

amendments to IAS 1 “Disclosure Initiative”;

amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 “Investment Entities: Application of the Exception to Consolidation”;

amendments to IFRS 11 “Acquisition of an interest in a joint operation”;

amendments to IAS 12 “Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses”;

amendments to IAS 7 under the “Disclosure Initiative” project.

The application of these texts has no significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**B.2.2 Texts adopted by the European Union but not yet mandatory**

**IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”**

On 22 September 2016, the European Union adopted IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which is
mandatory from 1 January 2018. The associated amendments, subject to their adoption by the European Union, will be
applicable on the same date as IFRS 15.

The Group has not applied this standard in advance.

The Group’s accounting policies in relating to the accounting of its income are set out in note D.2 below. The Group's
analysis of income and contracts with customers in its various activities did not identify any significant impact of the
application of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.

**IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”**

“IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments”, issued by the IASB in July 2014 and adopted by the EU on 29 November 2016, will replace
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments” as of 1 January 2018. This new standard defines new principles for the classification and
measurement of financial instruments, impairment for credit risk on financial assets and hedge accounting.

The Group has not applied this standard in advance.

The analysis carried out by the Group on the first application of this new standard has not identified any significant impact
on its consolidated financial statements.

**IFRS 16 “Leases”**

IFRS 16 “Leases” will be mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Under this standard, all leases
other than short-term leases and those for low-value assets must be recognised in the lessee’s statement of financial
position, in the form of a right-of-use asset and in consideration of a financial debt.

The Group currently presents “simple” rentals off-balance sheet. The analysis of the potential impact of this standard, which
mainly concerns the Europorte segment, is currently being finalised.

The Group has not applied this standard in advance.

**Amendments to IFRS 4**

The amendments to IFRS 4 “Application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 4” will be mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1
January 2018. The Group has not applied this standard in advance.

**B.2.3 Other texts and amendments published by the IASB but not approved by the European Union**

The following texts concerning accounting rules and methods specifically applied by the Group have not yet been approved
by the European Union:

   amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 “Sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/joint
venture”;

   amendments to IFRS 2 “Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions”;

   interpretation IFRIC 22 “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration”;

   interpretation IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”;

   IAS 40 “Transfers of investment property”;

   IFRS 14 “Regulatory Deferral Accounts”;

   IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”;

   amendments to IFRS 9 “Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation”;

   amendments to IAS 28 “Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures”;

   amendments to IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” and IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”;

   amendments to IAS 12 “Income Taxes”; and

   amendments to IAS 23 “Borrowing Costs”.

###### B.3 Basis of preparation

**B.3.1 Conversion of foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the reporting currency of each individual company at the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than those
mentioned in note B.3.2 below are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period. Exchange differences are
dealt with in the income statement.


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**B.3.2 Exchange rates for consolidated entities**

GET SE’s company accounts and consolidated accounts are prepared in euros.

The accounts of the Group’s British subsidiaries, and notably CTG and its subsidiaries, are prepared in sterling and are
converted into euros as follows:

Retained reserves brought forward and Concession property, plant and equipment and related depreciation, at historical
rates.

All other assets and liabilities at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period.

Income statement items, with the exception of the Concessionaires’ depreciation, at the average rate for the year.

Exchange differences arising from the application of the above are included in the cumulative translation reserve in the
statement of financial position.

The closing and average €/£ exchange rates for 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

_€/£_ **2017** **2016**

Closing rate 1.127 1.168

Average rate 1.140 1.216

**B.3.3 Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. The Board of
Directors periodically reviews its valuations and estimates based on its experience and various other factors considered
relevant for the determination of reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’ carrying value.
Depending on the evolution of these assumptions, actual results may differ from current estimates.

The use of estimations concerns mainly the valuation of intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment (see note F),
the evaluation of the Group’s deferred tax situation (note I), the valuation of the Group’s retirement liabilities (see note E.4)
and certain elements of the valuation of financial assets and liabilities (note G.7).

**Brexit: the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union**

Following the UK's decision to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016, formal negotiations between the UK government
and the European Commission on the terms and mechanisms of the exit which started on 19 June 2017, entered the second
phase in December 2017 and are continuing as of the closing date of these accounts.

During 2017, the Group has not noted any significant impact of this decision on its business but continues its process of
active monitoring and detailed follow-up of potential risks that may arise.

The Group has taken account of this situation in the determination of the principal estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017 as set out above.

**Evaluation of deferred tax**

In updating its estimate of deferred tax as at 31 December 2017, the Group extended the period of activation of its
recoverable deficits from three to five years in order to align it with the horizon of its latest business plan. The estimate of
deferred taxes as at 31 December 2017 also takes into account changes in future tax rates in the UK and France and
changes in the UK rules on the use of tax loss carryforwards.

###### C. Scope of consolidation


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


**Global integration**


The accounts of entities under the Group’s direct or indirect control are included in the consolidated financial statements
using the full consolidation method. Control of an entity is deemed to exist when the Group:

holds power over the entity,

is exposed to, or entitled to, variable returns due to its involvement with the entity, and

has the ability to exercise its power over the relevant activities of the entity in order to affect the amount of returns it
obtains.

All significant transactions between the consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated, as are the Group’s internal results (capital
gains, profits on inventories, dividends).

The results of acquired subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is exercised. Companies acquired or
incorporated during the period are consolidated from the date of acquisition or incorporation.


**Investments in companies accounted for under the equity method**


Entities over which the Group exercises significant influence and entities that are jointly controlled are consolidated under
the equity method. These investments are initially recorded at cost, including any goodwill generated. Their carrying amount


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

is subsequently increased or decreased to take into account the Group’s share in profits or losses realised after the
acquisition date. When losses exceed the value of the Group’s net investment in an equity-accounted company, these losses
are not recognised unless the Group has a contractual commitment to recapitalise on behalf of that company.

If there is an indication of impairment, the recoverable amount is tested and the impairment losses resulting from these
impairment tests are recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the corresponding investments.

The Group has chosen to present the operating result of its share of the net result of companies accounted for by the equity
method, the operational nature of which is in line with the Group’s activity, after the operating profit and before a subtotal
entitled “Operating profit after share of result of equity-accounted companies”.

###### C.1 List of consolidated companies

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

Bourgogne Fret Services SAS, a subsidiary initially formed in conjunction with Cérévia, was fully taken over by Europorte
France SAS in 2017. Europorte France SAS, as a sole shareholder, decided to dissolve Bourgogne Fret Services SAS.

At 31 December 2016 and at 31 December 2017, all the Group’s companies are fully consolidated. Up to the purchase by
the Group in August 2016 of Star Capital’s 51% shareholding in ElecLink Limited, GET SE’s shareholding of 49% (held by
its subsidiary GET Elec Limited) was accounted for under the equity method.

###### C.2 Changes in the scope of consolidation 


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


**Business combinations**


Business combinations are recorded in accordance with the acquisition accounting method as set out in the revised IFRS 3.
Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value.

When a business is acquired in stages, the Group's previously held interest in the business acquired is revalued to fair value
through profit or loss at the time of full acquisition. For the determination of goodwill at the date of control, the fair value of
the consideration transferred (for example the price paid) is increased by the fair value of the interest previously held by the
Group.


Costs directly attributable to acquisition transactions are recognised in the operating result for the year.


**Sale of businesses**


The result of the entities sold in the period, together with the gain or loss on the disposal of these activities and the costs
directly attributable to the transaction, are presented, net of tax, on a separate line item in the income statement entitled
“Net result from discontinued activities”. The same treatment is applied to the income statement for the previous financial
year. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognised in respect of the investment held prior to the sale
is recycled to the income statement.


**Assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations**


IFRS 5 “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” sets out the accounting treatment applicable to
assets held for sale and the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.


_Assets held for sale_


Non-current assets held for sale are presented on a separate line of the statement of financial position when (i) the Group
has made the decision to sell the asset(s) concerned and (ii) the sale is considered to be highly probable. These assets are
measured at the lower of their net carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell.

Property, plant and equipment classified as “Assets held for sale” are no longer subject to impairment and depreciation is
stopped at the date of application of IFRS 5.


_Discontinued operations_


A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that the Group has decided to dispose of, either by terminating or
selling the activity and which represents a separate sector of activity and is part of a single co-ordinated disposal plan.

When these criteria are met, the results of discontinued operations are presented on a separate line in the consolidated
income statement for each period. The Group assesses whether a discontinued operation represents a separate sector of
activity mainly on the basis of its relative contribution to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued operations (including non-current assets, current assets and the related liabilities classified as held for sale)
are measured as a whole at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

Costs specifically incurred in the context of the cessation of the activity are presented in the income statement within the
“Net result from discontinued operations”.

**C.2.1 Assets held for sale and discontinued operations**

The net result per discontinued activity is as below:

_€'000_ **Note** **2017** **2016**

Maritime segment a) below 2,230 17,127

GB Railfreight Limited b) below 2,886 46,907

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**a)** **Maritime segment MyFerryLink**

Since the ending of its maritime activity in the second half of 2015, the Group has applied IFRS 5 “Non-Current Assets Held
for Sale and Discontinued Operations” to its maritime segment. The ferries Côte des Flandres and Côte des Dunes (formerly
the Berlioz and the Rodin) have been leased to the DFDS group since February 2016 and the AL Andalus Express (formerly
the Nord-Pas-de-Calais) has been leased to Vansea Shipping Company Limited since 4 May 2016. At the start of the lease
of each of the ferries, the lease contracts were recognised as finance leases for an amount equivalent to the minimum lease
payments to be received in accordance with IAS 17 “Leases”. Accordingly, the Group recorded an income net of tax of
€24 million in the consolidated income statement in 2016.

As indicated in note A.2 above, the Group received in 2017 €114 million from DFDS and €3 million from Vansea Shipping
Company Limited in consideration for the sale of the ferries in accordance with the agreements concluded between the
parties. During this process of selling the two ferries on 23 June 2017, DFDS notified the Group that it disagreed with the
option exercise price. The amount of the disagreement represents €15 million.

In 2017, the Group extinguished the finance lease receivables previously recognised in “Other financial assets” in the
statement of financial position. The sale of the two ferries generated an income of €15 million which is recognised in the
income statement of the discontinued operations at 31 December 2017 under “Other operating income”. The capital gain
generated by the sale gives rise to a current tax charge in 2017 and the reversal of the deferred tax charge recorded in
2016.

The Group is the subject of a number of legal claims following the cessation of its maritime activity, including those by the
liquidator of SCOP SeaFrance and the AGS (the French insolvency fund for the management of employee claims) as well
as the contestation by DFDS as to the exercise price of the put options for the two ferries. In a judgment delivered on 30
January 2018, one of the claims by the liquidator of SCOP SeaFrance, that relating to the contribution by the Group to the
losses of the SCOP on the basis of the existence of a company created in fact between the two entities, was dismissed at
first instance. In its consolidated accounts at 31 December 2017, the Group has recognised a provision for risk of €12 million
in relation to the various ongoing disputes relating to its maritime segment in the income statement of the discontinued
operations under “Other operating charges”.

**b)** **GB Railfreight Limited**

Subsequent to completion on 15 November 2016 of the sale of its subsidiary GB Railfreight Limited, the purchaser submitted
a claim to the Group on 29 December 2016 for a price adjustment under the terms of the sale contract. As a consequence,
the Group included a provision of €5 million in its consolidated accounts as at 31 December 2016 as part of the calculation
of the net profit on the sale recognised in “Other operating charges”. During 2017, an agreement was reached with the
purchaser on a final price adjustment of €2.3 million. Accordingly, in its 2017 consolidated accounts, the Group has released
the provision accounted for at the end of 2016 and has adjusted the related tax; the net impact amounts to an income of
€2.9 million.

**D.1.2 Geographical information**

The Fixed Link’s activities are mainly those of the transport of freight, vehicles and passengers between France and the
United Kingdom.

The Europorte segment’s revenues are generated mainly in France.

###### D.2 Revenue


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


Revenue corresponds to sales of services as part of the ordinary activities of the Group's various segments.


**Fixed Link**


Sales are recognised in revenue when the service is delivered.

For the Truck Shuttle activity, revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made.

For the Passenger Shuttle activity:


- when the reservation is made, the tickets are recorded in “deferred income”,


- then the revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made.



For the Railway Network passenger and rail freight tolls, revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made. For
the Railway Network’s annual fixed charges and contributions to its operating and investment costs, revenue is
recognised as a function of the Fixed Link’s availability.


**Europorte**


For the rail transport activity, revenue corresponds to sales of transport services and sales are recognised in revenue when
the service is actually performed.

For the maintenance and management of railway infrastructure, sales are recognised in revenue when the services are
actually performed.

ElecLink 509 838

**Total** **278,184** **285,578**

###### D.4 EBITDA/operating margin


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


EBITDA (or operating margin) as used by the Group is calculated by adding back depreciation charges to the trading profit.

###### D.5 Other operating income and (expenses)


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


**Distinction between the trading result and the operating result**


The Group considers that it is helpful to include an additional result line in the presentation of its income statement within
the operating result, in order to understand better its financial performance. This line is called the “trading result”, and
excludes income or charges which are non-recurrent in terms of their frequency and nature and for which the amount is
significant. The Group therefore applies recommendation number 2013-03 of the French national authority for accounting
standards, the Autorité des Normes Comptables.

**Sub-total other operating expenses** **(10,241)** **(14,557)**

**Total** **(8,952)** **36,447**

Other operating expenses relate mainly to provision for risk and legal and advisory costs arising from non-recurring
transactions.

###### D.6 Trade and other receivables


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


When a trade receivable is considered doubtful, an impairment allowance is made for the full amount due except in a small
number of cases where the Group considers that recovery is possible.

These relate to the leasing commitments for rolling stock by the rail freight subsidiaries. At 31 December 2017, the contracts
have a residual duration of up to three years and usually include options for renewal. In order to take into account changes
in leasing market conditions, the rental amounts of certain contracts are reviewed every year.

During the year, leasing charges of €11.3 million were accounted for relating to operating leases on rolling stock (2016:
€11.7 million).

###### E.4 Retirement benefits


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


The Group provides for its legal and contractual obligations for retirement indemnities of employees under French contracts,
and for the defined benefit retirement schemes of employees under UK contracts operated by CTG and ESL. The liability
for defined benefits, recorded in the statement of financial position, is the present value of the obligation under defined
benefit plans at the end of the financial year less the fair value of plan assets. These liabilities are valued using the actuarial
method of projected unit of credit on the basis of actuarial valuations made at the end of each financial year. The current
service cost of the period and the interest on the obligation are accounted for in the “staff benefit expense” line of the
consolidated income statement. Valuation of the liability for defined benefit plans in respect of (i) actuarial gains and losses,
(ii) the actual return on plan assets and (iii) changes in the effect of the asset ceiling benefits are recognised in the
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.

The Group has provided for the following retirement liabilities:

**E.4.1 UK employee defined benefit obligations**

GET SE operates two pension schemes in the UK: The Channel Tunnel Group Pension Fund and The Channel Tunnel
Group Senior Executives Pension Fund providing defined benefits for ESL staff based on final pensionable pay. The
characteristics of these schemes are similar and the assets of each are held in separate trustee-administered funds.

The valuation at the end of the financial year has been prepared by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the
requirements of the amended IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities and assets of the schemes as at the end of the reporting
period.

The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant
change, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods
and thus inherently uncertain, were:

**Assumptions**

The main assumptions that have been used in the actuarial calculations are as follows:


**2017** **2016**

Discount rate 2.7% 2.9%

Inflation rate 3.4% 3.5%

Future pension increases 3.3% 3.4%

**Sensitivity to changes in the main assumptions**

Reasonably possible changes to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions at the end of the reporting period, all things being
equal, would have affected the defined benefit liability by the amounts shown below.

_€'000_

**31 December 2017** **Increase** **Decrease**

Discount rate: +/-1% (62,300) 82,400

Inflation: +/-1% 52,300 (49,700)

Mortality: +/-1 an 14,100 (13,900)

**Expected cash outflows and risks associated with pension liabilities**

The investment strategy for managing the assets of the pension schemes is defined by the trustees of the pension funds.
The maturities of the contributions and the level of funding of schemes are negotiated between the Group and the trustees
on the basis of actuarial valuations carried out every three years. Contributions are intended both to recover the deficit
related to rights acquired in the past and to cover the service costs in future years.

The Group estimates that contributions to be paid into the defined benefit schemes in the 2018 financial year will be
€3.7 million, of which €1.9 million will be in respect of current service costs for the period and €1.8 million will be in respect
of the recovery of the deficit in the Channel Tunnel Group Pension Fund. The weighted average duration of the ESL plan is
23 years.

###### E.5 Share-based payments


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


**Share-based payments**


Share options are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. The options are valued at their fair value at the date on which
they are granted (see next paragraph) and any variations in value occurring after the grant date are not taken into account.
The value is charged to employee benefits expense on a straight line basis between the date of the grant and the maturity
date (the vesting period), with an equal and opposite entry directly to equity.


**Measurement of fair value**


The fair value of stock option plans is measured by applying the binomial Black & Scholes model and the Monte Carlo
approach. The basis of calculation includes the share price on the grant date, the exercise price of the options, expected
volatility of the underlying shares, expected period before exercise, expected dividends and share yield, and the expected
turnover of beneficiaries. Performance conditions which are not related to the market are not included in the fair value
measurement.

**E.5.1 Share options**

**Share option plan (treated as an equity instrument)**

On 26 May 2010, the general meeting of shareholders authorised the Board to grant, in one or several allocations, options
over shares in the company to executives and senior staff of GET SE and its subsidiaries, during a period the duration of
which is fixed at 38 months from 26 May 2010. The total number of options may not give the right to more than 3,900,000
shares of a nominal value of €0.40 each. The Board has allocated 3,900,000 shares held under the share buyback
programme to these options. Under this scheme, the Board have approved three grants of share options: on 16 July 2010,
21 July 2011 and 20 July 2012.

 F. Intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment

 F.1 Goodwill and intangible assets


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the acquired portion of identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities. It is measured in the functional currency of the acquired entity and is recognised in the
statement of financial position.

When the share of the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of acquisition,
a negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.

The fair value of intangible assets acquired following a business combination is measured using the present value of forecast
future cash flows after taxation generated by the assets concerned. The method of depreciation of these intangible assets
is determined according to the nature of the assets concerned.

During 2017, the Group completed the allocation of the goodwill that was accounted for on the acquisition of ElecLink in
2016. The goodwill of €119,955,000 at 31 December 2016 was fully allocated to an intangible asset, representing the
estimate of fair value as at the date of acquisition of ElecLink in 2016, of the licence and exemption granted to ElecLink by
the national regulators in 2013 and 2014. The intangible asset will be depreciated over the term of the licence and the
exemption, for a period of 25 years, from the date of start of operation of ElecLink’s interconnector.

Residual goodwill was recognised as of 31 December 2017, resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the
intangible asset in accordance with IAS 12.

###### F.2 Tangible property, plant and equipment


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Property,
plant and equipment is depreciated on a systematic basis in order to write down the costs of assets over their expected
useful lives as follows:

**Fixed Link** **Europorte**
Tunnels Concession Land, construction, fixtures and fittings Length of contract / 20 years
Terminals and related land:
Freehold land not depreciated
Concession land Concession  Landscaping 5 to 57 years
Terminals 5 years to life of Concession  Fixed equipment and machinery:

Fixed equipment 5 years to life of Concession  Fixtures and fittings 5 to 57 years
Buildings 5 to 30 years
Machinery and other equipment 5 to 30 years
Industrial equipment 3 to 10 years
Rolling stock 5 to 35 years
Vehicles 5 to 60 years
Parts 5 to 40 years
Office equipment: 3 to 10 years
Office equipment 3 to 10 years
IT equipment 3 to 10 years
Software 3 to 20 years



_*_ _The Concession expires in 2086._


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK


The expected useful lives of the assets are kept under review and revised when necessary, according to experience.

Concession property, plant and equipment whose useful life is greater than the duration of the Concession, is depreciated
over the life of the Concession on a straight line basis. Depreciation on assets whose useful life is less than the duration of
the Concession (“renewable assets”) is calculated on a straight line basis.

As all property, plant and equipment will be written down to £nil at the end of the Concession in 2086, depreciation of the
final renewal cost of renewable assets will be based on the residual duration of the Concession.

Costs directly attributable to the ElecLink project are capitalised and presented as “assets in course of construction” in the
statement of financial position. They will be amortised from the date they are put into operation.

Subsidies on capital expenditure received during the year have been allocated to the asset to which they relate.

**Measurement of fair value**

The fair value of tangible property, plant and equipment acquired following a business combination is measured by taking
the higher of the market value or the value in use.


**F.2.1 Concession property, plant and equipment**

In France, all immovable property, plant and equipment within the Concession area is the property of the French State and
will revert to it on the expiry of the Concession period (2086). In the UK, the Government has required CTG to transfer to it
the title to freehold land and property acquired for the purpose of construction and operation of the project and in exchange
has granted leases for the duration of the Concession. On the expiry of the Concession, the interest of the Concessionaires
in all movable property and intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of the Concession will become, without
payment, the joint property of the two States.

###### F.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


In accordance with IAS 36, the carrying amounts of assets and groups of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting
period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

In the Group each activity segment represents a cash-generating unit (CGU). In certain circumstances, the CGU may be
made up of a single operating legal entity.

If any indication of impairment exists, an impairment test is carried out: the net book value of the asset is compared to its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their market value and their value in use. The
market value is determined by reference to studies carried out by independent experts.

The value in use of CGUs is calculated by discounting operating cash flows after taxation and capital expenditure incurred
to replace assets as forecast in each of the CGU’s business plan as validated by the Group’s management as part of its
operational management. The period covered by the business plan is five years. For Concession assets, cash flows are
extrapolated on the basis of an assumption of growth over the residual duration of the Concession. For non-Concession
assets, the extrapolation is complemented by a terminal value which is calculated on the basis of infinite free cash flows that
continue to grow at a moderate rate limited to that of inflation. The discount rate retained is the WACC calculated per CGU
at each year end. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount.

**F.3.1 Concession property, plant and equipment**

At 31 December 2017, the Group did not identify any indication of impairment of its tangible Concession assets, but, in the
context of uncertainty related to the modalities of the final implementation of Brexit, nevertheless carried out a valuation in
order to ensure that the recoverable value of the assets remained higher than their net accounting value.


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

The valuation carried out at 31 December 2017 confirmed that the recoverable value of assets remained higher than their
net accounting value on the basis of a discount rate of 5.65% (31 December 2016: 6.11%) and on the basis of revenue
growth of approximately 2% for the period after the five year plan.

The Group also carried out a sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible changes to key assumptions (discount rate and
revenue growth rate) of plus or minus 1% as well as changes in the exchange rate between sterling and euros of plus or
minus €0.10. This analysis did not reveal a likely scenario which could lead to an impairment of Concession assets. The
worst-case sensitivity analyses do not show any impairment of Concession assets as of 31 December 2017.

**F.3.2 ElecLink property, plant and equipment**

ElecLink’s assets are composed of tangible assets in respect of construction works (see note F.2.2 above) and an intangible
consisting of the operating license and the exemption (see note F.1). The interconnector is due to start operating at the
beginning of 2020.

At 31 December 2017, the Group performed a test of value in use of the ElecLink CGU. This test, carried out in accordance
with the rules and methods described above and applying WACC of 7.86%, confirms that the value in use of the ElecLink
CGU’s assets is greater than its carrying amount at 31 December 2017.

The Group also carried out a sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible changes to key assumptions (discount rate,
financing rate, cost and time of construction and capacity selling price). This analysis did not reveal any likely scenario which
could lead to an impairment of goodwill.

In carrying out these valuation tests, the Group used the best estimates available to it at the balance sheet date. However,
in view of the ongoing construction of the ElecLink project and the current context, in particular linked to Brexit, the
assumptions on which these estimates are based are by their nature still uncertain and the actual results could be different
from these estimates.

**F.3.3 Europorte property, plant and equipment**

At 31 December 2017, the Group did not identify any indication of impairment of its Europorte assets, but nevertheless
carried out a valuation in order to ensure that their recoverable value remained higher than their net accounting value. The
market value of Europorte’s assets, estimated using studies by independent experts, was found to be at least equal to the
net accounting value at 31 December 2017.

###### G. Financing and financial instruments


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


**Financial instruments**


_Financial assets_


In accordance with IAS 39, the Group’s financial assets have been classified in one of the following four categories:


_i._ _Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss_


These are financial assets held by the Group for the purpose of generating a short-term profit, or assets designated
to this category at inception. These assets are measured at their fair value with changes in the carrying amount
being taken to the income statement.

These financial instruments include short-term treasury investments which are classified as current assets in cash
equivalents.


_ii._ _Loans and receivables_


Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed on an active
market and that are not held for trading purposes and are not available for sale.

These assets are initially measured at their fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. For short-term receivables that do not have a contractual rate of interest, the fair value is
assimilated to the original invoiced amount except where the effective interest rate has a significant impact.

These assets are subject to impairment tests if there is an indication of impairment losses. An impairment loss is
recognised whenever the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount.

Receivables arising on shares and trade receivables are included in this category. They are shown as financial
assets and as trade receivables.


_iii._ _Held-to-maturity investments_


Held-to-maturity investments are financial assets, other than loans and receivables, with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. At the end of the
reporting period, the Group has not designated any financial asset to this category.


_iv._ _Available-for-sale financial assets_


All financial assets that are not classified in another category are classified as available-for-sale. They are
measured at their fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity until the asset’s sale or
derecognition. However when there is objective evidence that an available-for-sale asset may be impaired, the
cumulative net loss is recognised in profit or loss. Impairments on equity securities cannot be reversed in


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

subsequent accounting periods. The impairment criteria defined by the Group for securities and shares (securities
with variable returns) correspond to a prolonged or significant loss. For debt instruments, the impairment is only
charged to the income statement when impairment is indicated that is related to a counterparty risk.

Fair value, for listed securities, equates to the market price. For unlisted securities, the fair value is determined by
reference to recent transactions or by using valuation techniques incorporating reliable and observable market
data. However, when no reliable estimate of the fair value of a security can be made, it is measured at historical
cost. These assets are subject to impairment tests to establish their recoverability.


This category includes shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other financial assets.


The classification defines the accounting treatment of these instruments. The classification is designated by the Group at
the date of initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. The purchase and sale of
financial assets are accounted for on the transaction date, being the date on which the Group has contracted for the purchase
or sale of the asset.


_Financial liabilities_


Financial liabilities include, in accordance with IAS 39:


_i._ _Borrowings_


Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost
according to the effective interest rate method.

For financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate, interest costs are recognised at a constant interest rate until
maturity of the debt using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly
discounts all of the contractual cash flows due on the debt until its maturity. These cash flows are calculated on the
basis of the estimated cash flows due on each instrument constituting the debt. The calculation takes into account
the transaction related costs and all other premiums and discounts.

For financial liabilities that are at a variable interest rate, cash flows are periodically re-estimated to reflect changes
in market interest rates, thereby changing the effective interest rate.

For financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate indexed to inflation, cash flows are periodically re-estimated
to take account of actual fluctuations in the inflation rate, thereby changing the effective interest rate.

A substantial change in the terms of all or part of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment
of the original liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the
discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received
and discounted using the original effective interest rate, differs by at least 10% of the discounted present value of
the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. If a modification of terms is accounted for as an
extinguishment, any costs or unamortised fees are recognised in the income statement on the extinguishment. If
the modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment of debt, all costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying
amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.


_ii._ _Interest rate hedging instruments_


All the derivative instruments are designed to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. They are measured at market
value and are used as cash flow hedges.

Cash flow hedges: the derivative instruments designed to hedge the floating rate element of the debt are accounted
for as cash flow hedges. The portion of the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value that is deemed
to be an effective hedge is taken directly to equity until the underlying transaction is recognised in the Group’s
financial statements. The portion deemed ineffective is accounted for in the income statement for the period. The
gains and losses included in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects
the income statement. The interest rate hedging instruments described in note G.2 on financial liabilities, meet the
criteria set out in IAS 39 and are therefore accounted for as cash flow hedges.


**Net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument**


Interest income and charges recognised in profit or loss include:



Interest on the financial assets and liabilities accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all commissions and margins payable or receivable between the
contracting parties which are an integral part of the effective interest rate, and all transaction costs and all other premiums
and discounts. The transaction costs are the marginal costs directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a
financial asset or liability.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives categorised as hedges (for the ineffective portion).

###### G.1 Description of the loans

**G.1.1 Term Loan**

During its financial restructuring in June 2007, the Group put in place long-term loans of £1.5 billion and €2 billion (collectively
known as the “Term Loan”). This loan comprised tranches index-linked to inflation (tranche A), fixed rate tranches (tranche
B) and variable rate tranches (tranche C) with maturities varying between 2041 and 2050. In August 2007, all the tranches
of the loan were purchased by a debt securitisation vehicle created for the purpose by the lenders, Channel Link Enterprises
Finance Plc (CLEF). Certain of the notes issued by CLEF as part of this securitisation were guaranteed by three monolines
who, in return for their guarantee, received a commission over the life of the loans.


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

On 24 December 2015, the Group concluded an operation that led to the withdrawal of two of the three monolines from their
roles as guarantors of the CLEF notes. This operation led to changes to the structure of the Term Loan and to certain of its
terms, such as the division of the index-linked tranches in to six new tranches and the reduction in the contractual interest
rate for some tranches by 0.6%. As the new conditions of the index-linked tranches of the Term Loan do not constitute a
substantial change in their terms, this operation was accounted for as a renegotiation of the existing loan and the associated
costs have been added to the carrying amount of the loan and will be spread over its remaining life. The fees incurred for
this operation totalled €123 million of which €66 million was paid between 2015 and 2017, €7 million will be paid in 2018
and €52 million will be paid over the remaining life of the tranche A loans.

**a)** **Refinancing of tranche C of the debt on 6 June 2017**

As indicated in note A.1.1 above, the Group completed the partial refinancing of its debt on 6 June 2017 which consisted of:

   the refinancing of tranches C1 and C2 and the partial termination of the corresponding hedging contracts,

   the raising of additional debt of €602 million in order to finance the costs of the partial termination of the hedging contracts
and other costs of the operation, and

   the redemption of the floating rate notes held by the Group on its statement of financial position under “Other financial
assets”.

**Refinancing of tranche C1**

Put in place in 2007 for a nominal value of £350 million, tranche C1 bore a variable rate of interest (LIBOR) plus a margin
of 3.39% and was fully hedged by a fixed/floating interest rate swap for which the Group paid a fixed rate of 5.26% and
received a floating rate (LIBOR). In 2016, the effective interest rate of this tranche including hedging was 8.8%. Repayment
of this tranche was to begin on 20 June 2046 and to end on 20 June 2050.

This variable rate debt was refinanced on 6 June 2017 by the issue of a new tranche, C1a. This new tranche of £350 million
bears a fixed interest rate of 3.043% until June 2029. In the absence of a refinancing prior to this date, tranche C1a will
revert to bearing a variable interest rate of LIBOR +5.78% (being a margin of 1.78% plus a step-up of 4%) and be fully
hedged by a fixed/floating interest rate swap for which the Group will pay a fixed rate of 5.26% and will receive a floating
rate (LIBOR). The contractual maturity and amortisation profile of this tranche remain the same as those of the tranche C1
it refinances.

**Refinancing of tranche C2**

Put in place in 2007 for a nominal value of €953 million, tranche C2 bore a variable rate of interest (EURIBOR) plus a margin
of 3.39% and was fully hedged by a fixed/floating interest rate swap for which the Group paid a fixed rate of 4.90% and
received a floating rate (EURIBOR). In 2016, the effective interest rate of this tranche including hedging was 8.43%.
Repayment of this tranche was to begin on 20 June 2041 and to end on 20 June 2050.

This variable rate debt was refinanced on 6 June 2017 by the issue of two new tranches:

   Tranche C2a of €425 million bears a fixed interest rate of 1.761% until June 2022. In the absence of a refinancing prior
to this date, tranche C2a will revert to bearing a variable interest rate of EURIBOR +5.55% (being a margin of 1.55%
plus a step-up of 4%) and be fully hedged by a fixed/floating interest rate swap for which the Group will pay a fixed rate
of 4.90% and will receive a floating rate (EURIBOR).

   Tranche C2b of €528 million bears a fixed interest rate of 2.706% until June 2027. In the absence of a refinancing prior
to this date, tranche C2b will revert to bearing a variable interest rate of EURIBOR +5.90% (being a margin of 1.90%
plus a step-up of 4%) and be fully hedged by a fixed/floating interest rate swap for which the Group will pay a fixed rate
of 4.90% and will receive a floating rate (EURIBOR).

The contractual maturity and amortisation profile of these tranches remain the same as those of the C2 tranche they
refinance.

**Partial termination of the interest rate hedging contracts**

As a result of the structure of the new tranches of the debt and in accordance with the stipulations of the Term Loan, the
hedging contracts were amended to suspend their application for the duration of the initial fixed-rate periods of the new
tranches C1a, C2a and C2b. The cost of the partial termination was €490 million (£154 million and €311 million), being €502
million corresponding to the market value of the contracts for the periods of their suspension less the discounts net of fees
negotiated with the counterparties to the contracts.

The portion of the fair value of the partially terminated hedging instruments amounting to €502 million was recorded as a
reduction in the liability of derivative instruments on the statement of financial position and, in accordance with IAS 39, will
be recycled to the consolidated income statement over the period of partial termination of the contracts.

The net profit from the discounts negotiated with the counterparties for the partial termination of the hedging contracts less
the associated costs is recognised in the income statement in 2017 in “Other financial income”.

The partial termination of the hedging contracts, in connection with the change in the Group's exposure to interest rate risk
on its debt, is in line with the interest rate risk management strategy put in place in 2007. As a result, these contracts continue
to qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with their designation as of the date of initial recognition.

**Tranches C1b, C2c and C2d**

In order to finance the costs of the partial termination of the hedging contract and the costs of the refinancing, the Group
contracted three new tranches of debt for a total amount of €602 million (at the exchange rate of 31 December 2017):


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

Tranche C1b for £336.5 million bears a fixed interest rate of 3.848% until its contractual maturity in June 2050. Its
amortisation profile (2046-2050) is the same as that of the old C1 tranche.

Tranches C2c and C2d for €83 million and €140 million respectively, bear a fixed interest rate of 3.748% until their
contractual maturity in June 2050. Their amortisation profiles (2041-2050) are the same as that of the old C2 tranche.

**Costs and fees of the 2017 refinancing operation**

Costs of the operation totalling €25 million are treated as follows in the consolidated accounts as at 31 December 2017:

Costs directly related to the issuance of the new debt amounting to €18 million are recorded as an adjustment to the
carrying amount of each new tranche and will be amortised using the effective interest rate. In the case of new tranches
C1a, C2a and C2b, the costs allocated to these tranches are amortised over the initial fixed-rate period of these debts.

Other costs of the operation amounting to €7 million are recorded in “Other financial charges” in the consolidated income
statement at 31 December 2017 (see note G.4 below).

**Redemption of the floating rate notes**

In 2011 and 2012, the Group acquired notes issued by Channel Link Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF) which corresponded
to the securitisation of tranche C of the Group’s debt. These notes, which had a nominal value of €164 million and were
recorded under “Other financial assets” on the statement of financial position, had been acquired at an average discount of
approximately 11%.

As part of the refinancing of tranche C on 6 June 2017, the nominal value of these notes was redeemed by the Group and
as a result, the discount that had not yet been recognised by this date, amounting to €14 million, was recorded in “Other
financial income” in the income statement at 31 December 2017 (see note G.4 below).

**b)** **Structure of the Term Loan**

The Term Loan put in place on 28 June 2007, as modified on 24 December 2015 and 6 June 2017, comprises the following

The effective rate of interest includes costs directly attributable to the debt, and for the A tranches, also includes the effect
of the indexation on the nominal value. The transaction costs used for the determination of the effective interest rate at 31
December 2017 correspond to the issue costs for the Term Loan in 2007 remaining to be amortised amounted to €29 million
and fees for the renegotiation of the A tranches completed in December 2015 remaining to be amortised amounted to €92
million and for costs for the refinancing transaction on tranche C in June 2017 remaining to be amortised amounting to €17
million. These costs relate mainly to financing, legal and bank fees.

**Undertakings and prohibitions under the Term Loan**

The Term Loan provides for a number of undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for this type of financing. These
relate to:

the creation of new or the continuation of existing guarantees on the assets of the Group;


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

   to the transfer of the assets of the Group and to the acquisition by the Group of new assets;

   to the granting of loans, guarantees or warranties to third parties; and

   the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent for utilisation of the loans under the Term Loan, including
inter alia the Railway Usage Contract.

In relation to the Term Loan, the Group must respect two financial ratios, only the first of which (see section on “Event of
default and acceleration” below), if not met, would constitute an event of default. The second ratio is the lower of the ratio of
operating cash flow to the total debt service on the Term Loan including the additional margin applied to tranche C of the
debt since 2012 and the ratio of operating cash flow to the total debt service on the Term Loan taking into account the
hypothetical amortisation on the Term Loan and on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test. GET SE
is required to ensure that at each six-monthly test date since 31 December 2007, this ratio is not less than 1.25. For the
purposes of this test, the ratio is calculated. Failure to meet this ratio on a six-monthly testing date would lead to restrictions
on the use of the Group’s excess available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the Term Loan until such
time as the test is met once again. These restrictions include, in particular, the ability of the Group to pay dividends and to
finance new activities. Failure to meet this test on three consecutive six monthly testing dates would trigger a prepayment
event, under which the Group’s excess available cash flow would have to be used towards prepayment of the Term Loan
until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again.

The debt service cover ratio and the synthetic service cover ratio for Groupe Eurotunnel SE at 31 December 2017 were 3.49
and 3.19 respectively, and thus the financial covenants for the period were respected.

**Voluntary prepayment of the Term Loan**

Clause 7.2 of the credit agreements provide for voluntary prepayments to be made on the Term Loan for a minimum amount
of £5 million or €7.5 million, without penalties but subject to the payment of certain market standard prepayment premia.

**Guarantees and security relating to the Term Loan**

_Guarantees:_

Under the Intercreditor Deed, the main companies in the Group each jointly and severally guarantee the obligations of FM
and CTG as borrowers of the Term Loan vis-à-vis the lenders, the arrangers and the hedging counterparties of the Term
Loan.

_Security granted by the Group under French law:_

   assignment of trade receivables by way of security under which (i) FM assigns the receivables held by it under the
Concession Agreement and the Railways Usage Contract as well as its the trade receivables held by it against the freight
transporters and coach operators, its insurance receivables and the intercompany receivables held by it against French
companies of the Group, (ii) CTG assigns the same categories of receivables as FM with the exception of trade
receivables owed by the freight transporters and coach operators and (iii) other members of the Group qualifying as
guarantors assign their insurance receivables and intercompany receivables held against French companies of the
Group;

   unregistered mortgages over FM’s main real estate assets that are not the subject of short-or medium-term development
projects;

   a registered pledge over FM’s rolling stock;

   a pledge on all bank and investment accounts open in France under the name of any borrower or guarantor of the Term
Loan;

   a pledge on shares in the Group members held by the borrowers or guarantors of the Term Loan;

   a pledge on the main Eurotunnel trademarks;

   a pledge on receivables held by FM under certain pieces of land comprised in the “ZAC 1” and which is the subject of
long term construction leases (baux à construction);

   a pledge on receivables held by GET SE against FM pursuant to the bonds facility agreement dated 28 June 2007 (as
amended on 29 August 2007) and entered into, inter alia, GET SE as lender and FM as borrower; and

   a pledge over their rights held in connection with the GIE (groupement d’intérêt économique) by GET SE, FM, CTG and
Eurotunnel SE.

_Security granted by the Group under English law:_

The main companies in the Group grant security over all of their assets held at the date of execution of the Term Loan as
well as over their future assets and over certain of their contractual rights.

_Security over the other assets of the Group:_

All of the shares of member companies of the Group that are not subject to security as described above (with the exception
of Europorte SAS and its subsidiaries) are pledged by way of security for the obligations of the borrowers under the Term
Loan and guarantors under the Intercreditor Deed.

**Event of default and acceleration**

The Term Loan contains a number of events of default which, in certain instances subject to grace periods, permit the
lenders to declare the Term Loan immediately due and payable, to enforce the security, and/or to demand the
implementation of the substitution mechanism provided for under the terms of the Concession.


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

The events of default include:

any non-payment under the Term Loan;

a failure to comply with any provision of the Term Loan, the Intercreditor Deed or related documents. These provisions
impose restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, acquisitions, disposals and other transfers, mergers,
borrowings, and the granting of guarantees and new security by the companies of the Group, and include, in particular:

   - a financial covenant which requires GET SE to ensure that at each six-monthly test date after 31 December 2007, a
ratio of operating cash flow to total debt service on the Term Loan is not less than 1.10, such ratio being calculated
by reference to a rolling 12 month period preceding the testing date; and

   - certain undertakings and representations relating to the tax treatment of the Group to the extent that a breach is
reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of FM, CTG or the Group;

a representation or warranty is made or deemed to have been made by a borrower or a guarantor under the terms of
the Term Loan, or any related finance document or any other document delivered by or on behalf of a borrower or an
Obligor under the terms of the finance documents (which contain representations and warranties that are customary for
this type of document), which proves to have been incorrect or misleading at the time at which it was made or deemed
to have been made;

the occurrence of a cross default under any other indebtedness in excess of a specified amount of any of the companies
within Group (other than Groupe Eurotunnel SE);

the inability of any borrower or guarantor to pay its debts as they fall due, the insolvency or the opening of any legal
proceedings in relation to any borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan;

the illegality or invalidity of the Term Loan, any related security or the subordination created under the Intercreditor Deed;

the Group becoming permanently unable to carry on the business of operating the Tunnel, the destruction of the Tunnel,
or the cessation of a material part of its business by a borrower or a guarantor;

a guarantor ceasing to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Groupe Eurotunnel SE;

any act or omission of France or the United Kingdom which renders a borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan
incapable of performing its obligations under the Term Loan and associated documents; and

the occurrence of litigation (or similar proceedings) against any Group member or its assets, which is reasonably likely
(i) to be adversely determined against the relevant company and (ii) to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of FM, CTG or the Group.

The Term Loan also includes other events of default which are customary for this type of financing.

**c)** **Hedging instruments**

In 2007, the Group put in place hedging contracts in place to cover its floating rate loans (tranches C1 and C2) in the form
of swaps for the same duration and for the same value (EURIBOR against a fixed rate of 4.90% and LIBOR against a fixed
rate of 5.26%). The nominal value of hedging swap is €953 million and £350 million.

These derivatives were partially terminated as part of the refinancing of tranche C in June 2017 as set out in note G.1.1.a)
above.

These derivatives generated a charge of €62 million in 2017 which was accounted for in the income statement (2016: charge
of €67 million).

These derivatives have been measured at their fair value on the statement of financial position as follows:

-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

In accordance with IFRS 13, the Group takes into account credit risk (DVA) and counterparty risk (CVA) in the valuation of
financial instruments. In practice, this recommendation particularly affects the valuation of derivatives to the extent that they
are measured at fair value including a probabilistic weighting of estimated cash flows.

In the case of a default by the Group, counterparties to the hedging contracts have priority over all holders of debt and
securities and guarantees granted to holders of debt under the Concession Contract and the Intercreditor Deed. In this
respect, the Group believes that the risk of loss for the counterparties in the event of default is insignificant and therefore
has not recorded a discount to the fair value of hedging instruments under the DVA.

The table in note G.8.2 below gives the periods in which the cash flows associated with the derivatives are expected to
occur, and the periods in which the amounts initially recognised in equity are expected to impact the income statement.

**G.1.2 Other loans**

“Other loans” in the above table amounting to €13.6 million at 31 December 2017 represent a bank loan drawn by Europorte
SAS in 2012 in order to finance the purchase of locomotives by its subsidiaries. This loan bears interest at a fixed rate of
4.37% and is repayable over a period of seven years.

###### G.7 Matrix of class of financial instrument and recognition categories and fair value


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


**Measurement of fair value**

_Trade and other receivables_

The fair value of trade and other receivables is measured on the basis of their expected recoverable value. This fair value
is measured for the purpose of the information in the notes to the accounts as part of the receivables acquired following the
business combinations.


_Cash and cash equivalents_


Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities less than or equal to three months from
date of acquisition which do not carry a significant risk of variation in value and which are used by the Group to manage
short term commitments. Money market funds are evaluated at their market value at the end of the reporting period.


_Financial instruments_


Financial assets accounted for at their fair value are classified in accordance with the following levels of fair value:

Level 1: fair value using quoted prices (unadjusted) observed in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: fair value using data (“inputs”) other than quoted prices included in level 1, which are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (in the form of price) or indirectly (determined from the price).

Level 3: fair value from valuation techniques which rely completely or in part on non-observable data such as prices on
an inactive market or the valuation on a multiples basis for non-quoted securities.


_Derivative instruments_


The fair value of hedging instruments is measured by discounting contractual future cash flows and integrating the credit
risk (CVA) or the counterparty risk (DVA).

The table below presents the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and their level in
the hierarchy of fair value. It does not include information about the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that
are not measured at fair value to the extent that the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

**Fair value of the Term Loan**

On 28 June 2007, the Group took out the Term Loan for £1.5 billion and €2 billion with a spread of 139 basis points. On 28
June 2012, the margin on the C1 and C2 tranches of the Term Loan changed to 339 basis points. This debt is accounted
for at its amortised cost.

The Term Loan is not quoted or traded on an active financial market and it is particularly difficult to identify any observable
market equivalents, taking into account the specificities and characteristics of the Group’s debt and in particular its 30 to 40year maturity profile (see note G.8.2 below).

The Group’s estimate of the fair value of the long-term loan is based on a level three fair value.


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

The modelling techniques used involve the discounting of future cash flows determined at the calculation date. The
discounting parameters are derived from a zero-coupon curve and an estimated credit spread based on a sample of
companies with comparable ratings with an adjustment to take into account the particularly long maturity of the Group’s
debt.

On this basis, the Group estimates the fair value of the Term Loan to be €5,627 million compared to a carrying value of
€4,274 million at 31 December 2017. As an indication, if the rate used (including the credit spread) was 100 basis points
higher, the fair value of the Term Loan would be approximately €602 million lower. With regard to the methodology used,
the Group does not prejudge the conditions that may be obtained on the market. Furthermore, the characteristics of the
current funding agreements govern any prepayment or refinancing operations on the Term Loan, and the resulting gains
that may arise for the Group.

**Fair value of the hedging instruments**

The characteristics of the Group’s hedging instruments and the estimate of their fair value as at 31 December 2017 are set
out in note G.1.1.c) above.

The fair value of the hedging instruments is calculated on the basis of mathematical models integrating the discounting of
the contractual flows linked to these instruments based on observable market data, in particular forward rate curves. The
discount rates are determined from zero-coupon curves.

The fair value of the hedging instruments is estimated based on a level two fair value.

The estimated fair value of the hedging instruments as determined by the Group is corroborated against the valuations
provided by the financial counterparties.

The sensitivity analyses of the fair value of these instruments to changes in interest rates are set out in note G.8 below.

###### G.8 Financial risks

**G.8.1 Exchange rate exposure**

Groupe Eurotunnel SE prepares its consolidated accounts in euros. Fluctuations in the value of the sterling/euro rates have
an impact on the value in euros of revenues, costs and financial income and costs, as well as on elements of the Group’s
reported assets and liabilities. By way of example and all else being equal and on the basis of accounting information at 31
December 2017, the table below presents the effect that a change of plus or minus 10% in the exchange rate would have

Approximately half of the Group’s revenues are denominated in sterling, whereas more than half of its operating expenses
and capital expenditure are in euros. The Term Loan is denominated in sterling for a total of £1.765 billion and in euros for
a total of €2.099 billion at 31 December 2017. All the external financial instruments are denominated either in sterling or in
euros. As a result, no exchange gain or loss can arise on revaluation of the external financial instruments. The residual
foreign exchange risk relates to the revaluation of intra-group balances, the residual value of which at 31 December 2017 is
€250 million; a 10% change in the euro/sterling parity would result in unrealised exchange gains or losses of approximately
€25 million.

The Group has and will continue to make every effort to closely match the currencies in which its revenues and costs are
denominated and will use currency hedging transactions to manage its foreign exchange risk where necessary.

The credit agreements allow, on condition that the debt service cover ratio is not less than 1.25, to apply for (i) a renewable
credit line of up to €75 million, and (ii) a structurally subordinated additional credit line of up to £225 million (or equivalent in
euros).

**G.8.3 Interest rate risk exposure**

The risk of an unfavourable movement in rates during the duration of the Term Loan is covered by the fact that tranches B1
and B2 are at a fixed rate of interest, the A tranches which are indexed on inflation are at a fixed rate of interest, and tranches
C1a, C2a and C2b are at a variable rate of interest but are covered by fixed/variable rate hedging contracts. Short-term
receivables and debts are not at risk from interest rate exposure.

The contractual cash flows associated with the swaps are paid simultaneously with the contractual cash flows of the variable
rate loans and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period where the interest on the debt
affects the result.

An increase of 1% in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the derivative instruments
of €282 million. A decrease of 1% in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the
derivative instruments of €425 million.

**G.8.4 Inflation risk**

The inflation risk relates to the interest and the repayments of principal on the indexed tranches (A1 to A6) denominated in
pounds and euros. By way of example, a variation of 1% in the inflation rate would have an impact of €15 million on the
amount of the principal of these tranches.


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**G.8.5 Credit risks**

Credit risk represents the risk of financial loss to the Group in the event that a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to honour its contractual obligations.

**Trade receivables**

The Group’s exposure to customer credit risk arises from its customers in the United Kingdom and Eurozone countries, with
the following exceptions:

The Group’s main customers, the Railways, accounted for 28% of the Group’s revenue in 2017.

Passenger Shuttle car customers pay for their tickets in advance, in particular via the internet; consequently, the credit
risk in relation to these customers is very limited.

The Group applies a credit policy which requires that every new customer is subject to a credit check before being able to
benefit from the Group’s standard credit terms. The Group’s credit risk exposure to account customers is managed by means
of continuous monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in regard to their credit limits and payment
terms.

**Investments**

The Group limits its credit risk exposure by only investing in i) short-term deposits and certificates of deposit with a maximum
term of one year with counterparties with a minimum short-term rating of P-1 from Moody’s or ii) in monetary SICAVs (the
French equivalent of mutual funds) and money market funds with a minimum long-term rating of Aaa from Moody’s or AAA
from S&P.

Funds invested by the Group in any one monetary SICAV or money market fund should not exceed £100 million per SICAV
or fund in pounds sterling or €120 million per fund or SICAV in euros. Investments in short term deposits or certificates of
deposit should not exceed £83 million or €100 million with any one bank group.

**Credit risk exposure**

The carrying value of the financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure. The maximum credit risk exposure
at the end of the reporting period is as follows:


**31 December**

Trade receivables 96,422 94,336

Cash and cash equivalents 612,533 346,637

**Total** **708,955** **591,960**

At 31 December 2016, financial assets included the floating rate notes (see note G.5.1 above).

###### G.9 Related parties with a significant influence on the Group

Two of Goldman Sachs’s infrastructure funds (GS Global Infrastructure Partners I, L.P., and GS International Infrastructure
Partners I, L.P., together known as GSIP) hold (on the basis of the last declaration of threshold crossing in September 2011)
approximately 15.5% of GET SE’s share capital at 31 December 2017.

During the financial restructuring in 2007, the Group concluded interest rate hedging contracts with financial institutions, in
the form of swaps. Goldman Sachs International was one of the counterparties to these hedging contracts, and at 31
December 2017 held 2.69% of the contracts, representing a charge of €1.7 million in 2017 and a liability of €19.3 million at
31 December 2017.

As part of the partial refinancing of the debt in June 2017, the Group paid to Goldman Sachs:

€12 million in respect of the partial termination of the hedging contracts to which it is a counterparty, and

€12 million in respect of their mandate as investment advisory and investment bank in connection with the operation.

###### G.10 Off-balance sheet commitments relating to financing

**G.10.1 Commitments in respect of the Term Loan**

GET SE, FM, CTG, Eurotunnel SE, EFL, ESGIE, ESL and EurotunnelPlus Limited each jointly and severally guarantee the
obligations of FM and CTG in relation to the Term Loan. In order to guarantee these obligations, these companies have
granted security as described in note G.1.1 above.

**G.10.2 Commitment to acquire index-linked bonds**

As set out in note J below, the Group concluded an agreement in respect of the bonds issued in 2007 by CLEF on 29
December 2017.

The Group’s policy is to maintain a solid capital base in order to retain the confidence of investors, creditors and of the
market and to support the future development of the activity. Capital can include the share capital, share premium and
retained earnings. The Board monitors return on equity and the level of dividends paid to shareholders.

The Group buys its own shares on the market. The timing of these purchases depends on the market price. These
transactions are carried out as part of the share buyback programme of which the liquidity contract is part (see note H.1.3
below).

During the year, the Group has not changed its policy on the management of capital.

and the grant of free shares, as approved by the general meetings of shareholders in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016
and 2017.

As part of the 2017 share buyback programme, GET SE continued with the liquidity contract entered into on 18 May 2010
with Oddo BHF. Under the terms of this contract and in accordance with the code of ethics issued by the Association
française des marchés financiers and approved by the French market authorities (Autorité des marchés financiers) on 1
October 2008, GET SE appointed Oddo BHF to intervene on its behalf in the market in order to improve the liquidity of
transactions and the stabilisation of prices of GET SE’s shares and to avoid price differences not justified by market trends.
At 31 December 2017, the following means were allocated to the balance of the liquidity contract: 280,000 GET SE ordinary
shares and €10,904,949.96 in cash. On the basis of a price of €10.720 per share, this combined amount represented 0.24%
of GET SE’s capital in issue at 31 December 2017.

###### I. Income tax expense


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**


**Income tax**


Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.


_Current tax_


Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted
at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.


Additional tax payable on the distribution of dividends is accounted for when the dividends are recognised as a liability.


_Deferred tax_


Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except as provided by IAS 12 “Income Taxes”.


The tax rates used are those in effect at the end of the reporting period.


Net deferred tax is determined at the level of each tax group.


Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient
future taxable profits will be available against which the differences can be used, at the level of the tax entity.

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are recognised according to the likelihood of their recoverability assessed on
the basis of the Group’s budget and medium-term plans. The assumptions in these plans used are the same as those used
for testing the value of assets.

###### I.1 Effect on the income statement

**I.1.1** **Tax provisions of the Concession Agreement and other provisions**

The Concession requires that the Group’s Concessionaires (CTG and FM) share equally the cost price of the project and
all revenues and costs relating to the operation of the Fixed Link between the British and French companies. Operating
revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement of the partnership and are shared equally between the
Concessionaires. Revenues and costs which do not relate to the operation of the Concession are not subject to these
sharing arrangements.

Article 15 of the French Finance Act 2013 (2012-1509 of 29 December 2012) relating to the limitation of the deductibility of
financial expenses does not apply to the subsidiary FM owing to the exclusion from the scope of the financial expenses
borne by concessionaires for goods acquired or built by them under a concession contract.

**I.1.2** **Tax accounted for through the income statement**

_€'000_ **2017** **2016**

Current tax:

Income tax (2,724) 954

Tax on dividends 8,889 (3,545)

**Total current tax** **6,165** **(2,591)**

Deferred tax 50,369 (14,858)

**Total** **56,534** **(17,449)**

The current tax charge relates to amounts paid or to be paid in the short term to the tax authorities for the year, according
to the rules in force in the different countries and specific conventions.


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

In 2017, the income in relation to tax on dividends corresponds to a refund in respect of previous years following the
cancellation of the dividend tax by the French authorities. The deferred tax income results from the activation of two
additional years of recoverable deficits following the Group's decision to extend the activation period from three to five years
in order to align it with the horizon of its latest business plan.

In 2016, the current tax income corresponded to a tax refund in respect of previous years.

For the French tax group at 31 December 2017, the proof of tax has been prepared for the 2017 financial year on the basis
of the tax rate in force of 34.43%. However, since the main reversals of temporary differences are planned beyond the period
of application, the deferred tax on the French tax group was calculated taking into account the rates applicable between
2018 and 2022.

For the British tax group, in view of its not being fiscally profitable at 31 December 2016 or at 31 December 2017, deferred
tax was calculated for the years 2018 to 2022 on the basis of the Group's estimates using the rates applicable between
2018 and 2022.

**Property, plant and equipment**

The impact of taxation on property, plant and equipment corresponds mainly to the conditions relating to the deductibility of
the Fixed Link’s depreciation costs in the French tax group (reintegration of impairment costs) and in the British tax group
(profile of tax deductions in respect of depreciation, including Capital Allowances).

Deferred tax resulting from temporary differences on property, plant and equipment will reverse over the period until the end
of the Concession in line with the profile of the Group’s depreciation charges and taxable results.

**Profit arising from restructuring**

The financial restructuring in 2007 gave rise to profit in the consolidated accounts of €3,323 million. At 31 December 2017,
the taxation of €1,364 million of this amount remains deferred within the French tax group. The taxation of this residual profit

is dependent upon the repayment of a loan between the Concessionaires (FM and CTG) and Groupe Eurotunnel SE, which
in turn is subordinated to the Term Loan which matures in 2050.

**Hedging contracts**

At 31 December 2017, the Group recognised in equity a deferred tax asset amounting to €104 million for future recycling to
the income statement from the revaluation reserve for the hedging contracts that were partially terminated as part of the
debt refinancing operation described in note G.1.1 above.

**Deferred tax in respect of tax losses**

Deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses within the French and British tax groups amount to
€314 million at 31 December 2017 (€73 million for the French tax group and €241 million for the British tax group).

The recognition of these assets for each of the tax groups is based on:

   The forecasts of taxable profits derived from the Group’s five-year business plan for its different activities; this plan is
based on the same assumptions as those used in the impairment test of assets (see note F.3 above). On the basis of
these forecasts in respect of taxable profits, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of carried forward
losses which are expected to be utilised in the next five years for both the French and British tax groups.

   The forecasts for use of carried forward losses to cover the reversal of temporary differences on the British tax group.

Other temporary differences, notably those relating to deferred tax assets on retirement liabilities, are mostly recognised on
a five-year horizon.

Unrecognised temporary differences correspond mainly to a deferred tax asset in respect of that part of the interest rate
hedging contracts which have not been terminated whose reversal is expected beyond the recoverability horizon.

**French carried forward tax losses**

In France, the deficits can be carried forward indefinitely but their allocation to the profit recognised for a financial year is
limited to a ceiling equal to €1 million plus an amount of 50% of the taxable profit for the financial year exceeding this first
limit.

GET SE is the parent company of the consolidated tax group which it forms with all the Group’s French subsidiaries.

At 31 December 2017, the cumulative tax losses of the tax group which can be carried forward indefinitely, after adjustments
in 2017, amount to €2,782 million (31 December 2016: €2,853 million), consisting essentially of:

   cumulative tax losses which can be carried forward indefinitely of €868 million generated by the GET SE consolidated
tax group since 1 January 2008 and chargeable to the taxable profits of the members of this group (31 December 2016:
€923 million); and

   cumulative tax losses which can be carried forward indefinitely of €1,914 million (31 December 2016: €1,921 million)
generated by the old TNU SA consolidated tax group. These deficits may only be applied to the taxable profits of FM,
Société Immobilière et Foncière Eurotunnel SAS and Europorte SAS.

Potential unrecognised tax assets in respect of the carried forward tax losses of the French tax group amount to €661 million
(on a base of €2,531 million).

**British carried forward tax losses**

In England, the tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely but their allocation to the profit recognised for a financial year
is limited to a ceiling equal to £5 million plus 50% of the taxable profit of the year exceeding this first limit. Tax losses carried
forward from before 1 April 2017 are only attributable to the profits of the entity that generated them. Tax loss carryforwards
arising after 1 April 2017 are chargeable to the profits of all entities of the British tax group.

At 31 December 2017, the tax losses carried forward for the British companies amounted to £2,730 million (31 December
2016: £2,694 million).

Potential unrecognised tax assets in respect of the carried forward tax losses of the British tax group amount to €282 million
(on a base of €1,661 million).

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

 Report of the statutory auditors on the annual parent company financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2017

_This is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report on the statutory financial statements issued in French_
_and it is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users._

_This statutory auditors’ report includes information specifically required by European regulation and French law in such_
_reports, whether modified or not._

_This report should be read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing_
_standards applicable in France._

To the Shareholders,

**I.** **Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying
financial statements of Groupe Eurotunnel SE for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of
the company as at 31 December 2017 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French
accounting principles.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.

**II.** **Basis for opinion**

**Audit framework**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements” section of our report.

**Independence**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 January
2017 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 5(1)
of Regulation (EU) 537/2014 or in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.

**III.** **Justification of assessments – key audit matters**

In accordance with the requirements of articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)
relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material
misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the
current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

###### VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS AND INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES (NOTES E AND F)

**Risk identified** **Our response**


The shares in subsidiary undertakings, set out in the balance sheet
at 31 December 2017 for a net amount of €1,512 million represent
one of the largest items of the balance sheet. They are recognised
at their acquisition date at acquisition cost and depreciated, if
applicable, on the basis of their value in use representing what the
company would agree to disburse in order to obtain them if the
company had to acquire them. At 31 December 2017, the
intercompany receivables amounted to €2,117 million.

As indicated in note E, the value in use is estimated by management
on the basis of various criteria (net assets, revalued net assets,
discounted cash flows and external valuations).

Estimating the value in use of these investments requires
management’s judgment in selecting the items to be considered,
elements which may correspond to accounting elements or
projected elements (long-term business plan and economic situation
in the countries concerned).

In this context and because of uncertainties inherent in certain
elements and in particular the probability of realisation of the
forecasts, we have considered that the correct valuation of equity
investments, receivables from equity interest and provision for risks
was a key point of the audit.


Our work consisted mainly in verifying that the estimate of the
values in use determined by the management was based on an
appropriate justification of the valuation method and the numerical
elements used.

We ensured that:
```
- the value in use of the investments in subsidiary undertakings

```
in France Manche SA and Channel Tunnel Group Limited has
been assessed taking into account the most recent valuation of
the Concession;
```
- the value in use of the investments in subsidiary undertakings

```
in Europorte SAS has been assessed taking into account the
independent external studies and available cash;
```
- the value in use of Euro-TransManche Holding SAS’s

```
investments in subsidiary undertakings has been assessed on
the basis of a net book value of the asset;
```
- the value in use of all investments in subsidiary undertakings is

```
greater than their net book value.

In addition, our work also consisted of assessing the recoverability
of intra-group receivables.

**IV.** **Verification of the management report and of the other documents provided to shareholders**

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required
by French law.

**V.** **Information given in the management report and other documents sent to shareholders on the financial**
**position and the annual accounts**

We have no matters to report regarding the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the
information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents provided to shareholders
with respect to the financial position and the financial statements.

**VI.** **Corporate governance information**

We attest the existence, in the section of the management report of the Board of Directors relating to corporate governance,
of the information required by articles L. 225-37-3 and L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).

Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in
their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare
these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and
controlled companies. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.

**VII.** **Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Appointment of the statutory auditors**


KPMG

Appointed as statutory auditor of Groupe Eurotunnel SE by

the annual general meeting on 9 March 2007.

As at 31 December 2017, KPMG were in the eleventh year

of total uninterrupted engagement.


Mazars

Appointed as statutory auditor of Groupe Eurotunnel SE

by the annual general meeting on 9 March 2007.

As at 31 December 2017, KPMG were in the eleventh

year of total uninterrupted engagement.


**VIII.** **Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French
accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control
and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting
procedures.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors.

**IX.** **Statutory auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

**Objectives and audit approach**

Our responsibility is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

As specified in article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include
assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises
professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management in the financial statements;

assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a
going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw
attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided
or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; and

evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

**Report to the Audit Committee**

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit
program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also, if any, report any significant deficiencies in internal control
regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in this audit report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 537/2014, confirming
our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by articles L. 82210 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de
_déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably_
be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

 Notes to the financial statements 

Groupe Eurotunnel SE, whose registered office is at 3 rue La Boétie, 75008 Paris, France and whose shares are listed on
Euronext Paris and on NYSE Euronext London, is the Group’s consolidating entity. The term “Groupe Eurotunnel SE” or
“GET SE” refers to the holding company which is governed by French law. The term “Group” refers to Groupe Eurotunnel SE
and all its subsidiaries.

The main activities of the Group are the design, financing, construction and operation of the Fixed Link’s infrastructure and
transport system in accordance with the terms of the Concession (which will expire in 2086), the rail freight activity of the
Europorte segment as well as the construction and operation (expected for the beginning of 2020) of the 1,000 MW electricity
interconnector between the UK and France by ElecLink. The maritime activity was discontinued in 2015.

GET SE provides various services to its subsidiaries such as administrative and financial management, corporate strategy
and shareholder relations. In 2017, GET SE charged its subsidiaries €19.4 million for these services, of which €16.7 million
was charged to the Concessionaires.

###### A. Important events

 A.1 Financing of the ElecLink project

Following the acquisition of 100% of ElecLink Limited by the Group in August 2016, GET SE concluded on 10 July 2017 a
loan agreement with its subsidiaries GET Elec Limited and ElecLink Ltd. This intra-group loan, which includes the
shareholder advances already granted to GET Elec Limited at the date of signature, was granted within the framework of
the financing of the ElecLink project and to cover the acquisition of ElecLink’s shares in 2016.

At 31 December 2017, the loan from Groupe Eurotunnel SE to its subsidiary GET Elec Limited amounted to €368 million
(see note F.1 below).

###### A.2 Repayment of the Euro-TransManche Holding SAS loan

The Group completed the sale of its maritime segment’s three ferries on 23 June 2017 for the Berlioz and the Rodin and on
5 July 2017 for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. These sales were carried out by three subsidiaries of Euro-TransManche Holding
SAS, subsidiary of GET SE.

The receipts from these sales were partially used to fully repay the intra-group loan from GET SE to its subsidiary EuroTransManche Holding SAS (see note F.1 below).

###### A.3 Repayment of the Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited loans

On 6 June 2017, the Group concluded the partial refinancing of its debt which included the redemption of floating rate notes
held by the Group. The receipt from this was used to fully repay the intra-group loans from GET SE to its subsidiary
Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited (see note F.1 below).

###### A.4 Payment of a dividend by Europorte SAS

On 24 May 2017, by decision of the chairman of Europorte SAS and in accordance with articles L. 232-12 and R. 232-17 of
the French Commercial Code and by reference to article L. 227-1 of the said code, it was decided to pay a dividend of
€0.54 per share, representing an amount of €22.8 million, to Groupe Eurotunnel SE.

###### A.5 Payment of an interim dividend by Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited

On 7 June 2017, Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited decided to pay an interim dividend of £12.1 million (equivalent to
€13.9 million) to Groupe Eurotunnel SE.

###### B. Accounting methods and policies

The annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in France. Transactions
recorded in the accounts are valued in accordance with the historical cost convention and the accounts are prepared on the
going concern basis.

###### B.1 Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. The Board periodically reviews its
valuations and estimates based on its experience and various other factors considered relevant for the determination of
reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’ carrying value. Depending on the evolution of these
assumptions, actual results may differ from current estimates.

The use of estimations concerns mainly the valuation of investments in subsidiary undertakings and of associated debts
and loans (see note F below).

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**Brexit: the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union**

Following the UK's decision to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016, formal negotiations between the UK government
and the European Commission on the terms and mechanisms of the exit which started on 19 June 2017, entered the second
phase in December 2017 and are continuing as of the closing date of these accounts.

During 2017, the Group has not noted any significant impact of this decision on its business but continues its process of
active monitoring and detailed follow-up of potential risks that may arise.

The Group has taken account of this situation in the determination of the principal estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017 as set out above.

###### B.2 Valuation of intangible and tangible assets

Intangible assets consist of goodwill (see note C below). This goodwill has been allocated to the underlying assets in
accordance with ANC 2015-06. This goodwill has been reclassified in 2017 as “other financial assets” because it is related
to the Amended Bond Debt.

Intangible and tangible fixed assets are valued at their acquisition cost. These do not include any share of financial expenses
or overheads.

Fixed assets are amortised according to their economic lives as mentioned below:

Software 1 to 3 years

Machinery and other industrial equipment 5 to 10 years

IT equipment 5 years

Office equipment 5 years

Office furniture 5 to 10 years

###### B.3 Valuation of investments in subsidiary undertakings

GET SE assesses the value in use of its investments in subsidiary undertakings on the basis of several criteria, such as the
net book value of the asset, the adjusted book value of the asset, the discounted net financing cash flows, or external
evaluations. A depreciation of intra-group loans where applicable or a provision for impairment may be made when the net
assets of the subsidiary undertaking is negative.

###### B.4 Investments in securities

Investments are stated in the statement of financial position at cost. If the market value is lower than the acquisition cost, a
provision for depreciation is booked for the difference. “Investments in securities” and “Cash and cash equivalents” include
any accrued interest due thereon.

###### B.5 Treasury shares

GET SE holds its own shares acquired as part of a share buyback programme and a liquidity contract.

Treasury shares which are reserved explicitly for a share option plan are accounted for as investments in securities at their
purchase price.

In the absence of an explicit allocation to staff or to a share capital reduction, the shares purchased as part of the buyback
programme are accounted for at cost in financial fixed assets.

Shares acquired as part of the liquidity contract, the aim of which is to reduce excessive volatility in GET SE’s shares, are
accounted for at cost in investments and the gain or loss on sale of these shares is calculated on a FIFO basis.

At the end of the financial year, these shares are valued on the average share price during the last month. A provision is
made if this valuation is below the book value, except for those shares which are allocated to stock option plans, the free
shares and shares that are to be cancelled.

###### B.6 Share-based payments

As part of the share option plan, GET SE makes a provision for risk and charges relating to share option grants as soon as
it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources from the business in the future. When treasury shares are granted
as part of a share option plan, a provision is made for the difference between the exercise price proposed to the beneficiaries
and the net accounting value of the treasury shares granted.

###### B.7 Tax integration convention

Under the terms of the group tax integration convention, tax charges are recognised in the individual financial statements of
consolidated companies, on a stand-alone basis. Any tax savings or losses realised by the Group are recognised
immediately in the parent company’s income statement for the financial year.


-----

###### 1 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

 B.8 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when there exists a legal or constructive obligation stemming from a past event and when the
future cash flows can be reliably estimated.

###### B.9 Conversion of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies

Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for on the basis of the exchange rate on the
date of the transaction, and are then re-valued at the rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

Unrealised exchange differences resulting from this revaluation are recorded in the cumulative translation reserve. A
provision for risks and charges is recognised if the conversion shows unrealised losses.

###### C. Intangible assets 

The goodwill of €116,552,000 which resulted from the merger of TNU SA into GET SE in 2009 previously accounted for as
an intangible asset has been reclassified since 1 January 2017 as a financial asset to reflect the treatment of the underlying
asset in accordance with regulation ANC 2015-06 (see note F.1 below).

**Total** **18,982** **17,416**

_*_ _These receivables (totalling €1,610,790,000) are governed by the Master Intra-Group Debt Agreement as described in chapter 8 of the 2017 Registration_
_Document. This agreement is intended to harmonise (i) the rules for current accounts between Group companies, (ii) the interest rates of the various intra-_
_group debts and (iii) where possible, the other conditions of these intra-group debts in order to facilitate the financial and accounting management of Group_
_companies and to reflect the financial policy between the Group’s companies. This agreement falls within the scope of R. 225-31 of the French Commercial_
_Code relating to regulated agreements and commitments._

**Amended Bond Debt (ABD)**

The ABD corresponds to the original bond holdings purchased by EGP as part of the 2007 financial restructuring with the
proceeds from the issue of the NRS. This receivable was transferred by EGP to GET SE in 2008 and in 2009 on the basis
of a valuation by an expert. The ABD, the nominal value of which at 31 December 2017 was €1,361 million and £242 million,
is accounted for by GET SE taking into account the discount on its purchase.

The ABD bears interest at EONIA +1% for the receivable from France Manche SA and at LIBOR +1% for the receivable
from Channel Tunnel Group Limited. The ABD is subordinate to the Group’s external financial liabilities supported by France
Manche SA and Channel Tunnel Group Limited, the contractual termination date for which is 2050.

The change in the amount of the ABD with Channel Tunnel Group Limited arises as result of a variation in the exchange
rate for the year. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised on the statement of financial position in exchange adjustment
asset or in exchange adjustment liability as appropriate.

Since 2017, the goodwill arising from the merger of TNU SA into GET SE (see note C above) has been recognised as a
financial asset. It is affected to the ABD owed by France Manche SA.

**NRS Redemption Premium Debts**

The NRS Redemption Premium Debts correspond to the premium of 40% paid by EGP on the early cash redemption of the
NRS I in April and July 2008 and which was due from France Manche SA and Channel Tunnel Group Limited to EGP in
accordance with the terms of the ABD.

The NRS Redemption Premium Debts carry interest at EONIA +1% for the receivable from France Manche SA and LIBOR
+1% for the receivable from Channel Tunnel Group Limited. During 2017, £6.8 million was repaid.

The change in the amount of the NRS Redemption Premium Debts arises as result of a variation in the exchange rate for
the year. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised on the statement of financial position in exchange adjustment asset
or in exchange adjustment liability as appropriate.

**NRS Commission Loan**

The NRS Commission Loan corresponds to the amount due by France Manche SA relating to commissions paid by EGP as
part of the financial restructuring in 2007.

The NRS Commission Loan bears interest at EONIA +1%.


-----

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**Intra-group loans: Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited**

These loans were repaid in full in 2017 following the redemption of the floating rate notes as part of the partial refinancing
of the debt in June 2017.

**Intra-group loan: Euro-TransManche Holding SAS**

The intra-group loan made by GET SE to it subsidiary Euro-TransManche Holding SAS (the holding company for the Group’s
maritime activities) was made in order to finance the acquisition of certain assets from the former SeaFrance group, the
rehabilitation of the ferries and to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of this activity.

This loan was repaid in full in 2017 following the sale of the maritime segment’s ferries.

**Intra-group loan: GET Elec Limited**

Following the acquisition of 100% of ElecLink Limited by the Group in August 2016, GET SE concluded a loan agreement
with its subsidiaries GET Elec Limited and ElecLink Ltd on 10 July 2017. This intra-group loan, which incorporated the
shareholder advances already granted to GET Elec Limited at the date of signature, was granted within the framework of
the financing of the ElecLink project and to cover the acquisition of ElecLink’s shares in 2016.

At 31 December 2017, the loan amounted to €367.9 million or £326 million (31 December 2016: €144 million or
£123.4 million).

This loan bears interest at 3.748% for the euro tranche and at 3.848% for the sterling tranche.

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**2.3** **TRENDS, OUTLOOK, RECENT EVENTS AND EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD**

Events after the reporting period are described in note J to the consolidated financial statements for the financial year set
out in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

**Trends**

In 2017, the Group has once more demonstrated the strength and balance of its economic model in all circumstances.

The Group remains very confident in the sustainability of its Fixed Link business and in its potential for growth. The Fixed
Link continues to be, and will increasingly assert itself as, the principal choice for trade and movement of people between
the UK and continental Europe.

The Group follows developments relating to the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and is pleased that
negotiations have proceeded to the second stage and that a transition period with follow the exit on 29 March 2019.

Analysis of economic forecasts for areas that are important for the Group’s business (Greater London, Kent, Western
Europe), reinforces these fundamental strengths.

The Group is determined to grow traffic volumes through the Tunnel whilst also increasing its margins. To do this, the Group
will pursue a commercial policy that is attractive based on the quality of service, the digitalisation of processes and
cooperation with railway operators, all whilst achieving targeted investments such as the enlargement of the terminals or the
opening of the new Flexiplus lounge on the Folkestone terminal which is forecast for the first half of 2018.

The Group, which has created value through its rail freight activity, will continue with the development of Europorte in 2018,
whilst continuing to focus on the profitability of its operations.

The Group will continue to optimise its financing structure to enable, when market conditions permit, in order to minimise
the cost of servicing its debt over the long term.

**Objectives[6]**

With confidence in its future, the Group confirms its financial objective of an increase in EBITDA to €545 million in 2018.
This objective is the update of the one announced previously, taking into account an exchange rate of £1=€1.14 and a fourmonth delay in the implementation of the new London-Amsterdam service.

The start of ElecLink operations in 2020 will represent a significant step change in the Group’s profitability. In total, in the
current context, the Group believes it should exceed an EBITDA of €700 million (at £1=€1.14) in 2022.

The Group confirms its intention to continue with its policy of a regular growth in dividend payments to shareholders with a
target increase per share of €0.05 per year.

**Forecasts**

The Group does not publish forecasts.

**Recent events**

_Acquisition of index-linked bonds_

As set out in note A.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements as set out in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document,
the Group signed a commitment on 29 December 2017 to acquire some of the index-linked bonds issued by Channel Link
Enterprises Finance Plc in 2007.

On 9 February 2018, the Group concluded this transaction and acquired all the G2 bonds. This transaction was carried out
by an English subsidiary of the Group, Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited, and was partly financed by an external loan of
£190 million.

_Major shareholders_

On 2 March 2018, between the finalisation of the management report on 20 February 2018 and the date of this Registration
Document, Atlantia S.p.A declared that it had exceeded the thresholds of 15% of capital and 25% of voting rights of Groupe
Eurotunnel SE, having acquired 100% of the capital and voting rights of Aero I Global & International S.à.r.l, the company
which holds 85,170,758 of the 550,000,000 ordinary shares that make up the share capital and to which 170,341,516 voting
rights are attached (on the basis of 639,030,648 theoretical voting rights), as set out in chapter 7 of this Registration
Document.

In accordance with article L. 233-7 II of the French Commercial Code, Atlantia S.p.A declared that it is not acting in concert
with third parties in respect of Groupe Eurotunnel SE, that it is considering continuing with its purchases depending on
market conditions, that it is not considering acquiring control of Groupe Eurotunnel SE and that it is considering seeking the
appointment of a number of directors consistent with its shareholding.

_6_ _These objectives are based on data, assumptions and estimates that are considered to be reasonable. They take particular account of_
_the consequences of the geopolitical context but are however liable to change or to be modified due to uncertainties related in particular_
_to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment. Furthermore, the materialisation of certain risks as described in_
_chapter 3 “Risks and controls” of this Registration Document could have an impact on the Group’s activities and its capacity to achieve_
_its objectives. The Group does not therefore make any commitments nor does it give any guarantee that the objectives will be met, and_

###### RESULTS AND OUTLOOK

**Flows between the companies of the Group**

Various agreements have been entered into between GET SE and its subsidiaries (provision of services and financing) to
structure the following operational and financing flows as set out below.

Concerning operational flows, GET SE undertakes, on behalf of its subsidiaries, various services which include financing
and administrative management and general strategy. The cost of these services is equally shared between FM and CTG
in accordance with article 19 of the Concession Agreement under which the two Concessionaires share equally at cost price,
all expenses and all revenues from the Fixed Link for the period during which they operate. GET SE also charges its services
to the other operating subsidiaries of the Group as “management charges” which correspond to head office charges and
services provided for the needs and the development of its subsidiaries.

The financial flows between GET SE and its subsidiaries fall within three categories:

flows resulting from debts and receivables created under the 2007 financial restructuring of the Group, as governed by
the Master Intra Group Debt Agreement (MIGDA) as described in chapter 8 of this Registration Document;

flows relating to the financing of GET SE’s activities by the Concessionaires;

flows put in place in order to finance new businesses.

Specific loans have also been set up for the purposes of financing the business of GET Elec Limited and EASL.

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

**3.1** **RISK FACTORS**

Like any business, the Group pursues its activities in evolving conditions and is necessarily exposed to risks (industrial,
environmental, human, commercial, financial and others) that, should they materialise, could have a negative effect on its
activities, its financial position and its assets.

Getlink identifies these risks using a formalised procedure and seeks to reduce the probability of their occurrence or the
potential impact by implementing formalised and specific action plans. The internal control procedures that contribute to
limiting the probability of occurrence or the impact are described in section 3.4 of this Registration Document.

Getlink applies the provisions of the reference framework published by the AMF (the French financial markets regulator) for
internal control and risk management systems. The general system of risk identification and management put in place is
presented in section 3.4 of this Registration Document.

For the 2017 financial year, Getlink has carried out the annual review of risks that could have a significant negative impact
on its operations, reputation, financial position or results. This review covered all active consolidated subsidiaries within the
scope of the Group on 31 December 2017.

The main risk factors to which the Group considers itself exposed at the date of this Registration Document are described
hereafter. This list is not exhaustive and there may be other risks of which the Group had no knowledge or that are considered
to be immaterial at the date of this Registration Document, and that could have an adverse effect.

**_3.1.1 RISKS RELATED TO GETLINK’S OPERATING ENVIRONMENT_**

**a)** **Economic and political situation**

The Group’s operations are directly influenced by the prevailing economic conditions in its main markets, particularly France
and the United Kingdom. Changes in cross-Channel traffic and also in rail freight traffic are linked to the general economic
and political context.

**Brexit**

The United Kingdom’s referendum vote on 23 June 2016 to leave the European Union opened a period of uncertainty. Article
50 of the European Union Treaty was triggered by the United Kingdom on 29 March 2017 with an official leaving date of 29
March 2019. The leaders of the European Union countries formally approved the opening of a new phase of negotiations
with the United Kingdom on 15 December 2017.

The United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union, whether close (inclusion in the European Economic
Area) or more distant (no specific agreement with the Union), is still unknown. Numerous risks, both regulatory and financial,
will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the terms of its future
relationship.

The United Kingdom’s economy continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate in 2017 compared to 2016. While the Group’s
business has demonstrated its resilience during periods of crisis, the worsening or stagnation of economic conditions could
have a direct impact on cross-Channel traffic volumes for both passenger and freight activities.

The Group has accordingly introduced a specific process to monitor potential risks as well as detailed monitoring of
regulatory risks, risks relating to taxation and financing as well as macro-economic risks relating to the business’s activities.
This risk is regularly monitored (through specific reviews, sensitivity tests of the business plans and the review of various
financial and legal indicators). The results of these activities are presented to the Audit Committee and to the Board of
Directors.

The Group regularly meets with UK ministers and civil servants as well as the French customs authorities and members of
the European Parliament Commission for Transport and Tourism (TRAN). The Group sits on the border coordination steering
group led by HMRC, which brings together representatives from the main ministries concerned and is tasked with identifying
the most efficient solution for future border controls. Operating and technical teams examine the practical implications of
each scenario.

_Risk of a fall in British economic growth_

The 2017 traffic and revenue figures demonstrate the resilience of the Tunnel’s business model when faced by a slowdown
in UK growth. These results support the conclusions of an EY study[7 ]published in October 2016, confirming the status of the
Tunnel as a vital link uniting the United Kingdom and continental Europe. In this study, EY estimated that a quarter of
commercial exchanges between the United Kingdom and continental Europe pass through the Tunnel. The industrial sectors
that depend on the speed and reliability of the Tunnel would appear to present greater resilience to an overall drop in British
growth (“just-in-time” for the automotive industry, express delivery for logistics companies and transport of fresh
food products).

After a downturn in 2016, Eurostar traffic recorded an increase in passenger numbers in 2017, as presented in section 2.1.1
of this Registration Document.

_Risk of a fall in the pound sterling_

The pound sterling exchange rate was immediately impacted by the 2016 referendum results and stabilised in 2017. A
change in the exchange rate could affect the Group’s profits since the consolidated financial statements are presented in

_7_ _Source Economic footprint of the Channel Tunnel Fixed Link: An analysis of the economic value of trade and passenger traffic_
_travelling through the Channel Tunnel October 2016_
_http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uploadedFiles/assets-uk/the-channel-tunnel/EY-Channel-Tunnel-UK.pdf_


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

euros: a fall in the exchange rate translates into a decrease in the Group’s revenue when reported in euros, even though its
intrinsic value has not changed in the original currency. This risk is more specifically developed in paragraph c)iv) of this
section. Nevertheless, a fall in the pound sterling reduces financial costs on loan tranches denominated in pounds.

As part of its work on the 2017 financial statements, the Audit Committee kept a particularly close eye on the methods of
calculating translation and foreign exchange differences. In particular, it monitored the periods used to calculate average
exchange rates in order to select relevant time intervals, representative of actual fluctuations in exchange rates, especially
for particularly material operations.

_Risk of an increase in inflation_

Although an increase in British inflation leads to an increase in the cost of debt, it has a limited impact on the Group’s other
costs, which are mostly paid in euros, and it could even have a positive effect if it is reflected in Shuttle tariffs.

_Risk of an increase in border controls and customs duties_

With regard to goods, a “hard” exit of the United Kingdom could lead to the introduction of tighter controls on goods crossing
the border. If these potential new controls were to be carried out on the Fixed Link’s terminals, they could cause difficulties
for smooth and effective operations and would thus present a risk to the Shuttle revenues. The introduction of customs
duties could have a negative impact on the cross-Channel market. The impacts of a hard border would extend well beyond
the Group and its customers and even the local economies of Kent and the Hauts-de-France region. They would affect
thousands of companies that trade with the United Kingdom. There is also a security issue for a Europe that is facing
migratory pressure.

With regard to passengers, the Treaty of Canterbury, presented in chapter 8 of this Registration Document, will continue to
apply. This treaty commits the two countries to providing smooth traffic conditions through the implementation of juxtaposed
identity controls. Travellers taking the Eurostar or the Shuttle are controlled by the French Border Police and then directly
by the UK Border Force on the departure terminal. Eurostar passengers and Shuttle vehicles are not controlled on arrival.

The same principle also applies to freight traffic. Juxtaposed controls are indispensable not only to the industrial value chain
but also to security. This can be achieved through a paperless process or by performing as many procedures as possible
away from the border point. For a number of years already, registration plate recognition has removed the need to stop at
toll booths. More recently, an innovative programme introduced with the authorities means that drivers do not need to stop
every time they cross to have their identities checked if they do not wish to do so. As indicated in section 1.6.2 of this
Registration Document, the Group has invested several million euros with the support of the authorities to improve the
efficiency of the strengthened migration controls, while maintaining the same transit time for Truck Shuttle customers and
goods trains, notably by increasing the number of posts, available lanes and staff performing controls.

_Regulatory and legal risk_

Like any business with an activity in the United Kingdom, the Group is faced with legal and regulatory uncertainty.

The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union has no impact on the status of the Fixed Link, which depends on
bilateral treaties, thus protecting its business model. It is not known if the exit of the United Kingdom from the European
Union could lead to the UK’s exit from the Internal Energy Market, the system that allows the coupling of electricity markets
and facilitates cross-border balance; if that happens, it could affect the ElecLink business model.

**Terrorist threats or attacks**

The Group constantly faces the risk of a terrorist threat or attack on its installations, particularly the Fixed Link, or on
neighbouring infrastructure required for circulation of the trains or Shuttles. This risk has increased following the terrorist
attacks since 2015 in France and elsewhere in Europe. The Group carries out activities on behalf of the States and
consequently must implement security and public health measures along with specific measures for the application of
national programmes (such as the French Vigipirate security alert system). As stipulated in the Concession Agreement, the
Group adapts its operating practices to meet these requirements and to deliver the required quality of service. It is not
possible to rule out a change in these requirements that would make it necessary for the Group to adapt its operating and
commercial practices, leading to an increase in operating costs or a deterioration in service quality and which could have an
adverse effect on the Group’s image, competitive advantages, activity, financial position or results irrespective of the
insurance cover in place (see section 3.3 of this Registration Document) and government responsibilities.

Risk management procedures relating to the risk of terrorism have been set up centrally by the Group in coordination with
the authorities (armed forces, border police, etc.), under the supervision of the French and British governments. This risk is
also taken into account in the very design of the Tunnel and the System.

**Migratory crisis**

In 2017, Europe continued to face a major migration crisis and the Group further strengthened the means necessary to
secure its site. The Fixed Link now has a high level of protection, following a major investment programme, and the support
of both the French and the British States who are in charge of border controls.

This situation, by its nature, presents a risk in terms of image, corporate social acceptability and the values that the Group
stands for. Moreover, the situation could again evolve in Europe and the Group could again have to adapt to a new
environment. The political context of the Group’s business is a key factor considered by the management, which is
establishing jointly with the public authorities concerned, the control arrangements needed to secure the Fixed Link, and the
safety of customers and employees.

**Economic context**

All economic risks are measured and monitored at meetings of the management committees to anticipate and prepare for
changes in the economic environment, and to make any necessary strategic and tactical adjustments.


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

**b)** **Competition**

In its various activities, the Group faces strong competition from both international and national players in the private and
public sectors. This competitive environment (presented in chapter 1 of this Registration Document) could intensify across
all of the Group’s areas of activity, particularly in a context of competitive volatility and increased sensitivity among customers
to the quality of service.

The Group’s Fixed Link activities face competition from cross-Channel transportation operators, whose pricing strategies
and other competitive initiatives could have a negative impact on Shuttle Service volumes (particularly Truck Shuttle
services) and on passenger numbers in High-Speed Passenger Trains. Market growth and competitive pressure could be
impacted by fluctuations in the price of fuel which may affect competitors’ pricing policies. As indicated in chapter 1 of this
Registration Document, the Group’s commercial and operating strategy could be affected by this context, where service
quality remains a crucial distinguishing factor. The reduction in the number of competitors in the Short Straits to two has
reduced this risk.

With regard to Europorte’s competitive environment, developments in the market and in rail freight transport traffic and
related activities are quite specific. As a result of a complex combination of economic, logistical and industrial factors,
including the reliability of the transport service, the quality of train paths and the balancing of prioritisation of freight and
passenger transport, French rail freight traffic has fallen significantly. In 2017, competition between operators remained lively
and the historic operator still dominated the market. In addition, increasing competition from building and public works sector
companies for rail maintenance activities could have an impact on the renewal of certain Europorte contracts.

Fixed Link and Europorte activities are exposed to a risk of competition distortion as a result of the award by public authorities
of financial aid to structures operating in their markets that may be considered illegal.

Competition leads the teams to give of their best in the service of customers. In this context, improving profitability and
ensuring growth are constant challenges. The Group adjusts its operations and processes in order to adapt its cost structure,
offering new services to its customers and enhancing its commercial offering.

The Group adapts its commercial strategy to this competitive environment, particularly during operational reviews of its
various business segments. Since 2016, Europorte’s management has thus redefined its strategy and objectives for the
coming five years, concentrating on contracts offering added value in order to improve productivity.

**c)** **Market risks**

**i.** **Rate risks**

The Group’s financial debt at the closing rate on 31 December 2017 was €4,287 million. The maturity of the Group’s financial
assets and debts is set out below:

_€ million_ **Under 1 year** **1 year to 5 years** **Over 5 years**

Financial assets – – –

Financial liabilities 68 239 3,981

**Net position** **68** **239** **3,981**

As part of the Group’s treasury management procedures described in section 3.1.1c)v of this Registration Document, the
Group Finance Department continually monitors movements in inflation and interest rates and the Treasury Risk
Management Committee receives formal monthly reports containing forecast and actual rate changes.

**ii.** **Interest rate**

As indicated in note G.8.3 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document, the risk of
adverse movements in interest rates during the life of the Term Loan is covered by the fact that 11 tranches of the loan are
at a fixed rate and three tranches, refinanced in 2017, are at fixed rates for periods of 5, 10 and 12 years before returning
to floating rates hedged by a swap converting the floating rates to fixed rates for the remainder of the Term Loan.

**iii.** **Inflation rate**

As indicated in note G.8.4 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document, the
inflation risk affects both interest and principal repayments on the six inflation-linked tranches denominated in sterling and
in euros. By way of illustration, a one-point increase or decrease in the inflation rate would have an annual impact of
€15 million on the amount of the principal of the A tranches.

**iv.** **Exchange rate risk**

The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in euros.

Fluctuations in the sterling-euro exchange rate have an impact on the value in euros of revenue, costs, financial income and
expenses, as well as on the assets and liabilities as published by the Group. The following table summarises the exchange
rate sensitivity of the Group’s profits and equity at 31 December 2017 in relation to sterling exchange rate fluctuations:


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

_€ million_ **2017** **2016**

**Variation in exchange rate** **Rate Published** **+10%** **-10%** **Rate Published** **+10%** **-10%**

Equity 1.127 2,051 2,270 1,832 1.168 1,812 1,603 2,021

A little less than half of the Group’s revenue is generated in sterling, while a larger proportion of expenditure (operating
expenses and investment) is payable in euros. The Group’s Term Loan is denominated in sterling for the nominal amount
of £1.765 billion, and in euros for the nominal amount of €2.022 billion at 31 December 2017.

At 31 December 2017, the Group’s balance sheet exposure to currencies was as follows:


**Net position**
**before hedging**


**Hedging**
**instruments**


**Net position**
**after hedging**


_€ million_ **Assets** **Liabilities**

Euro 922 (2,793) – (1,871) – (1,871)

Sterling 672 (3,201) – (2,529) – (2,529)

The assets and liabilities in the above table do not include fixed assets or equity, which are carried at historical exchange
rates.

The Group’s various business activities result in receivables and payables between the different Group companies,
sometimes in different currencies, particularly between GET SE and its subsidiaries. The Group arranges funding for its
various business activities. These intra-Group financing arrangements may generate currency imbalances which, taking
account of exchange rate risk and depending on the direction of the funding flows, may automatically translate into losses
in the consolidated financial statements.

The Group is working on improving the match between the currencies in which its revenue and costs are denominated. The
Group also uses currency hedging operations to ensure optimum management of this risk. However, there is no guarantee
that these measures will significantly reduce the risk borne by the Group in the event of a fall in the rate of sterling against
the euro nor that they will ensure that the materialisation of this risk would not have a significant impact on the Group’s
financial position and/or its ability to service its debt.

In addition to the measures described above, the Group’s Finance Department continually monitors movements in the
sterling-euro exchange rate, while its Treasury Risk Management Committee receives formal monthly reports containing
forecast and actual exchange rate fluctuations. The work of the Treasury Risk Management Committee is reported to the
Audit Committee.

**v.** **Credit and counterpart risks**

**Customer credit risk**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to its customers in the United Kingdom and Eurozone countries, with the
exception of:

the Railways which are public institutions and which accounted for 28% of the Group’s revenue in 2017;

the Group’s Passenger Shuttle customers pay for their tickets in advance, particularly via the Internet; the credit risk in
relation to these customers is consequently very limited.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on trade receivables, as well as the ageing of those trade receivables and the
provision for bad debts, is explained in detail in note D.6 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this
Registration Document.

Credit risk is limited in view of the distribution and volume of the customer portfolio. In fact, revenue from the Group’s five
largest customers, not including the Railways, only accounted for 5% of its total revenue in 2017.

The Group manages its customer credit risk through a credit policy requiring that every new customer undergo a credit
check before being able to benefit from the Group’s standard credit terms. The Group’s credit risk exposure to account
customers is managed by the continuous monitoring of their financial position and of their outstanding debt in relation to the
credit limits and payment terms granted to them.

**Suppliers**

The Group is exposed to counterparty risk with its suppliers, which is the risk that the contracting party fails to fulfil its
commitments (delivery, payment, repayment etc.).

The Group’s exposure to counterpart risk with its suppliers is managed by framework agreements that contain standard
mechanisms such as third party guarantees.

The French law on due diligence requires that suppliers be monitored during the contract period. The Group has entrusted
its duty of vigilance to an external company that collects and verifies suppliers’ regulatory and legal documents.


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

**Short-term investments**

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on short-term investments is set out in note G.8.5 to the consolidated financial
statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in (i) term deposits and certificates of deposit with a maximum
maturity of twelve months, and with counterparties with a short-term rating of at least P-1 from Moody’s, and (ii) funds and
money market funds with a long-term rating of at least Aaa from Moody’s or AAA from S&P.

The amounts invested by the Group in any one fund or money market fund cannot exceed €120 million or £100 million per
fund or SICAV (open-ended collective investment scheme) denominated in euros and pounds sterling respectively.
Investments in term deposits or certificates of deposit with the same counterparty may not exceed €100 million or £83 million.

The Treasury Risk Management Committee monitors the Group’s compliance with this investment policy.

**Liquidity risk**

A significant proportion of the Group’s operating cash flow is taken up by interest payments on the Term Loan and, since
2013, ongoing repayment of the principal until 2050. This commitment could reduce the Group’s capacity to finance its
investment expenditure or any external growth operations.

A detailed analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities by contractual maturity is presented in note G.8.2 to the consolidated
financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

The contractual conditions pertaining to the Group’s bank loans and, in particular, the cases of default and early repayment,
as well as the financial covenants with which the Group must comply in servicing its debt, are set out in section 8.1 of this
Registration Document and in note G.1.1 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration
Document.

The contractual conditions pertaining to the hedging instruments put in place by the Group on the floating-rate portion of its
debt in the form of swaps are set out in note G.1.1.c to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this
Registration Document.

The Group manages its liquidity risk exposure through centralised treasury management within the Group’s Finance
Department, which continually monitors the Group’s liquidity position. Short and medium term cash forecasts are drawn up
each month and presented to the Treasury Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Corporate Finance Director and
including the Group Director of Financial Control and the Group Cash Manager and their principal managers.

As indicated in note G.8.2 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document, the Group
has carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that it is able to meet its future obligations.

As indicated in section 2.1.4 of this Registration Document, at 31 December 2017, the Group was in compliance with its
debt service cover ratios (financial covenants).

GET SE received a Baa2 rating from Moody’s in 2007, which is still valid at the date of this Registration Document.

**vi.** **Energy and commodities risks**

The Group uses electricity as its main source of energy for the Fixed Link, particularly for train traction. The supply of
electricity represents a significant expense for the Group (accounting for about 6% of overall operating expenditure in 2017)
and an overall major increase in the cost of commodities and electricity could have an impact on the Group’s results.

In the light of the highly volatile energy market, the Group has a risk management policy which covers both market price
and volume risk.

High volume purchases on the British wholesale market are performed under annual contracts. Purchases are made in
tranches to spread the risk, based on fundamental and technical market analysis.

To mitigate volume risk, the Group closely monitors its electricity use and regularly updates its forecasts.

In the power supply contracts, the volume constraints imposed by electricity suppliers are negotiated in such a way as to
reduce the Group’s volume risk (possibility to change contractual volumes without financial penalty).

The Europorte entities favour the use of electrical power. Whenever these subsidiaries use diesel locomotives, the cost
price of traction may be affected by a change in the fuel price. A campaign to raise train driver awareness of economical
driving practices was launched in 2017.

For Europorte, the risk associated with changes in the price of fuel is covered by price revision clauses in its contracts with
customers.

**vii.** **Risk on shares and other financial instruments**

The operational cash flow of the subsidiaries is invested in short-term and liquid investments in order to manage liquidity
risks.

The Group’s investments are governed by its treasury policy and are therefore limited to the list of financial instruments
detailed in “Short-term investments” above. The Group does not invest in shares, interest rate instruments or other
derivatives.

These limits permit management of the risk of default by a given issuer, based on the average credit rating of all the bonds
of that issuer (companies, States, State-owned companies and agencies), and account for all of the Group’s exposures. The
Group ensures that these limits are complied with through specific governance. Each month, the Risk Management
Committee checks that exposure is maintained within the acceptable limits and determines the actions to be taken in case
of excessive concentration of risk. The work done is reported yearly to the Audit Committee.

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

**viii.** **Significant volatility in the share price**

In recent years, notably with the announcement of the UK Brexit referendum vote, stock markets have seen major
fluctuations that have not always reflected the results of the companies whose shares are being traded.

**d)** **Risks related to retirement benefits**

In the United Kingdom, the Group administers two defined benefit pension schemes:

  the main pension scheme, The Channel Tunnel Group Pension Fund, which changed in 2010 from a wholly defined
benefit plan to a hybrid scheme (part defined benefit and part defined contribution);

  an historic defined benefit plan (Senior Executive Pension Fund, open only to senior managers who joined prior to 2000).

An independent actuary values the schemes’ assets and liabilities. The present value of the schemes’ assets, which are not
due to be realised in the short term, may change significantly as a result of market developments.

When the valuation of the schemes’ assets and liabilities reveals underfunding, the Group can be asked to fund the shortfall
within the framework of a plan extending over a period of up to 10 years. A deficit was recorded when The Channel Tunnel
Group Pension Fund value was last assessed in 2017 and the Group was required to set up a recovery plan of £1.6 million
per year for a nine-year period.

Risks associated with the UK pension schemes are managed through a regular review process and meetings with the
trustees, actuaries and other professional advisers.

**e)** **Exceptional weather events**

The Shuttle Service, unlike the ferries, is unaffected by sea conditions and is not dependent on the weather. However,
extreme weather conditions, such as major storms, heavy snowfall or heatwaves can make road networks impassable, thus
preventing customers from accessing the Fixed Link and can make operating conditions more difficult. Such events can also
disrupt the functioning of the Fixed Link infrastructure, that of Railway Companies using the Fixed Link and/or that of service
providers and key supply networks that are indispensable to the operation of the Fixed Link (electricity, water, roads, fuel,
etc.). Finally, they can also affect rail freight transport activities or the financial position of their customers. Thus, extreme
weather events can affect the Group’s business and impact its revenue.

For the Concession, the Group has on-site weather stations to forecast these events. Moreover, operational continuity plans
ensure the continuity of operations in degraded mode for a given period. In such cases, the Group also has management
plans for road traffic in the vicinity of the terminals.

**f)** **Risks related to health epidemics**

In the European and global health context, the outbreak of an epidemic or the fear of an epidemic are likely to have a
negative impact on traffic, leading to a fall in revenue and/or an increase in costs linked to public health measures.

For the implementation of its operational continuity plans, particularly with regard to operation of the Concession, the Group
has a crisis management structure in charge of deciding any operational adjustments that may be required and working
closely and continuously with the authorities entrusted with governmental responsibilities.

**_3.1.2 RISKS RELATED TO THE CONDUCT OF THE GROUP’S BUSINESS_**

**a)** **External growth operations and investments by the Group’s activities**

As part of its development strategy, the Group has pursued in the past, and may pursue in the future, external growth through
acquisitions. Such transactions involve a certain number of risks related to their implementation, the integration of the newly
acquired activities and personnel, the failure to generate expected synergies, the failure to maintain uniform controls,
procedures and policies, the appearance of unexpected costs or liabilities and to applicable regulations or authorisations
required especially in the event of divergence of interpretation between the French and British authorities. Consequently,
the expected benefits of acquisitions may not be realised in the timeframe nor at the levels expected.

The acquisition processes implemented by the Group, in particular due diligence procedures, aim for the best possible
assessment of the uncertainties that apply in such a case to these various risks.

Given the time required to build and commission new or replacement equipment for the Fixed Link, investments must be
planned several years before they are put into service. The length of the investment cycle carries risks for the expected
return on past investments. The uncertainties linked to this type of long-term investment could cause significant budget
overruns.

**b)** **Implementation of the ElecLink project**

The ElecLink project concerns the electricity interconnector through the Tunnel connecting the electricity distribution
networks in France and the United Kingdom. The Group, as the only shareholder, is exposed to 100% of the risk of ElecLink
Limited. The technical complexity of projects such as this may lead to difficulties in relation to design, construction and
installation, resulting in delays and additional costs. The Group has strengthened the operational monitoring and supervision
of this project. Furthermore, the Group has been particularly attentive to securing appropriate insurance cover for ElecLink
to cover any damage caused to the Tunnel. Despite all these controls, the risk of a disturbance to Fixed Link activities
remains.


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

Regulatory changes could also have an impact on the activity and revenue of this project. Since the work and operations
must be carried out in the Tunnel, which is a highly regulated environment as indicated in section 3.1.2i)i) of this Registration
Document, the regulatory authorities may impose specific technical or regulatory restrictions on the project. A change in the
business model due to the regulatory framework or political and regulatory instability post-Brexit could affect the profitability
of the project.

Since its activity is closely linked to energy trading, the ElecLink segment will be subject to the risk of fluctuations in French
and English electricity tariffs once it goes into operation.

**c)** **Image and reputation**

In a globalised world, where information is quickly shared, a business’s reputation and the image of its services can be
compromised very rapidly. Circulation in the media of prejudicial information, whether founded or not, facilitated by new
technologies and the development of social networks, could affect the Group’s reputation. The Group may be exposed to
reputational risks, particularly when the Group’s values or operational excellence are questioned, or when its legitimacy as
an infrastructure manager or transport operator is challenged, which could have a negative effect on the Group’s business,
results, image and development outlook.

The flow of migrants on the outskirts of Calais could have affected the image of the Short Straits and of the area around
Calais with the corresponding risk of customer disaffection. However, the sustainability of the resources put in place from
2015 and strengthened in 2017 has helped to secure the site and prevent service interruption.

As a business whose reputation and stakes have a national or even European impact, the Group is attentive to early warning
signs from stakeholders that could damage its image and/or reputation. The Group is aware that its behaviour as a binational
company is subject to scrutiny in a demanding political, economic and social context. The Group acknowledges its social
responsibilities and defends its values of safety and quality of service, and the national laws and regulations of both
countries, especially with regard to border management and security of their populations. Through its organisation and
procedures, the Group makes every effort to prevent the occurrence of such risks. The deployment of the Charter of Ethics
throughout the Group and the establishment of the anti-corruption policy aim to strengthen awareness of the rules of conduct
on which the integrity and ethics of the Group are founded.

**d)** **Operational risks**

**i.** **Operational risks inherent in rail transport and infrastructure operation**

**Maintenance**

The Group has more than 20 years’ experience in maintaining its rolling stock, equipment and infrastructure. It has a
standard maintenance programme, a long-term, large-scale maintenance programme, as well as a rolling stock and
equipment replacement plan as indicated in section 1.2.4 of this Registration Document. However, given the specific nature
of the Fixed Link’s rolling stock, equipment and infrastructure, the particular conditions of use in a salty environment (cause
of corrosion), and intensity of their use as well as technological advances, these programmes and plans may prove
insufficient or unsuitable, particularly in the event of premature obsolescence or an increase in technical faults. This could
lead to unforeseen costs or to partial or temporary interruptions of service that could affect the Group’s activity, financial
position or results. In addition, the work to install high-voltage cables in the rail tunnel as part of the ElecLink interconnector
project may affect traffic.

The Group has implemented standardisation and reconditioning programmes designed to reduce future maintenance needs
and improve the availability of its rolling stock. The impact of the new industrial solutions introduced to improve operating
performance may be hard to master and could lead to temporary disruptions to services. Regarding ElecLink, a number of
control mechanisms have been put in place to avoid disruption to Tunnel maintenance during the construction phase.

**Safety of employees and sub-contractors**

During the operation, repair or maintenance of its systems, technical incidents or accidents may jeopardise the safety of
Group employees and subcontractors and accordingly, raise the risk of a claim against the Group or its legal representatives,
in particular regarding workplace accidents. Due to changes in legal standards and case law towards greater protection of
victims, the causes of these accidents can be recognised before the relevant court as being events giving rise to civil or
criminal liability of the Group, its subsidiaries and/or the delegates concerned resulting in a civil or criminal conviction with a
corresponding impact on the Group’s image.

Preservation of the health and safety of workers is a priority for the Group. It is based on the assessment and prevention of
occupational risks within the business. The Group is committed to implementing all safety plans necessary to ensure the
safety of all persons working on its sites.

**Safety**

Safety-related and fire risks in the Tunnel are covered by the design of the System itself and by a series of principles,
procedures and controls that have been validated by the IGC.

With regard to past incidents, the occurrence of another major fire would result in a substantial increase in insurance
premiums. Whilst the effectiveness of the SAFE stations and the Salamandre Plan reduces the impact of this historical risk,
they cannot reduce the likelihood of recurrence.

The Group regularly monitors innovations in fire detection and prevention systems. The Group also takes into account the
fact that these risks could come from external entities using the Group’s facilities.


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

**Security: duty of excellence and first priority**

The growth of the Group rests largely on its capacity to conduct its activities securely and efficiently. This requires the full
involvement of every one of the Group’s employees at their respective levels of responsibility, with all sub-contractor
personnel present on the Group’s sites or within its teams taking ownership of the rules. The Group seeks to strengthen the
culture of security of each individual involved in the processes.

In the context of the migrant crisis, the action plan initiated by the Group from 2015 and continued in 2017 (as indicated in
section 1.2.1.d of this Registration Document) has put a stop to the intrusion attempts on the Eurotunnel site and to the
interference with operations. In order to guarantee a trouble-free crossing for the various businesses, transporters and all
its customers in the medium term, the Group has continued its efforts on the various measures to strengthen the security of
the site.

A new peak in the migrant crisis in Europe could require the investment of additional resources or deteriorate the fluidity,
the capacity and thus the quality of service, which could affect the performance of this business as well as the safety and
security of employees and customers.

**Europorte**

Europorte is seeking to optimise its current rolling stock fleet and is implementing a policy to anticipate requirements in
advance, aiming to adapt the size of the fleet accordingly to ensure the profitability of the business.

**ii.** **Inherent risks attached to the activities of the Railways and Railway Companies**

The Railways’ businesses, being the Group’s principal customers, could have a significant impact on the Group’s financial
position. The Tunnel is used by High-Speed Passenger Trains and Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services, whose results
could be affected by external events and circumstances beyond the control of the Group.

The Group does not operate these services and cannot exert direct influence on the commercial operation of High-Speed
Passenger Trains or the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services. The performance, service level (timetable, catering on board
and so on), capacities and prices offered by these operators to their customers, along with other factors that may be beyond
the operators’ control, influence the use of their services which, in turn, may affect the revenue that the Group receives from
the Railways and Railway Companies.

The Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services face organisational problems relating to coordination of national operators,
regulatory and labour constraints specific to the rail sector, technical constraints of the rail network lines used and the priority
of freight versus passenger traffic on infrastructure within the European Union. These barriers to development could make
it hard to achieve significant growth in the volumes transported by the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services, and could
even lead to a substantial decline in traffic. High-Speed Passenger Train services are also faced with barriers to development
and notably difficulties implementing efficient border controls and obtaining rolling stock authorisations, which can delay,
restrict or stop the development of services to new destinations. A significant portion of the Group’s revenue therefore
depends on the successful operation of these services by entities over which it has no control.

The railway facilities used by the High-Speed Passenger Trains and rail freight trains that are situated outside the Group’s
Concession could be subject to disruption from various sources. This could result in the stoppage or reduction of this traffic
as was the case in 2015 on the SNCF Réseau Fréthun site. Such events could have a negative impact on the Group’s
revenue derived from the usage of its Railway Network.

The Railway Companies are subject to a risk of a reduction in the market due to the current terrorist threat, which could lead
to a change in passenger behaviour. This risk was reflected by a slow-down in Eurostar traffic in 2016. This risk is difficult
to control since it is external to the Railway Companies and the Group and it depends on geopolitical conditions.

The risk inherent to the business and development of Railways and Railway Companies is mainly external to the Group
since it does not have actual control over the activities of the Railways nor the Railway Companies. Nevertheless, the Group
actively participates in the development of this activity. In particular, in the pricing framework of the Railways Usage Contract
defined in the Network Statement it aims to offer access conditions that are efficient, stable and encourage the growth of
the Railway Companies. In particular, the ETICA scheme (Eurotunnel Incentive for Capacity Additions) provides nondiscriminatory support for the development of new services by the Railway Companies during the key start-up phase and
the increase in traffic. In parallel, the Group conducts regular communication actions and cooperative initiatives with the
authorities (government ministries, IGC, ARAFER, ORR) and railway players (Railway Companies, infrastructure
managers), to help them understand and progressively reduce the barriers to growth. In this context, the Group works with
the authorities, Railway Companies and infrastructure managers to facilitate the development of new destinations and
improve the competitiveness of rail services.

**e)** **Human resources management**

**Skills**

The Group’s business encompasses a wide range of occupations and calls on a variety of skills. In the context of an inverted
age pyramid for the Fixed Link, the replacement of some staff and potential retraining plans are areas managed and
anticipated by the Group’s Human Resources Department.

Calling for a broad spectrum of requirements, particularly in terms of safety, technical expertise and psychological aptitude,
occupations in the rail industry require lengthy training. Staff shortages and the difficulty of replacement from within existing
teams, including the management team, connected with stiff competition among the various operators, could affect
developments.


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

In order to anticipate the risk of the loss of key skills or the growing scarcity of workers for certain jobs, the Group is pursuing
a human resources policy that focuses on forward-looking job management adapted to different contexts and on
encouraging employability through the development of training, as indicated in chapter 6 of this Registration Document. In
the absence of government training programmes leading to qualifications in the rail sector, the Group has set up CIFFCO,
which is dedicated to providing rail industry training courses. In addition, in order to retain its key employees and motivate
their performance, the Group has introduced long-term incentives and a free shares plan for all Group employees.

**Labour relations**

In the current climate, the risk of deteriorating labour relations and staff disputes cannot be ruled out. Strikes, walkouts,
industrial action or other forms of unrest could disrupt the activities of the Group. Such events could occur not only from
within the Group, but could also occur at its customers, subcontractors or suppliers. Developments within the Group could
mean that consultation and negotiation no longer effectively regulate relations between management and staff. In the event
of a breakdown in the negotiation process, those relations could deteriorate, leading to loss of motivation and trust among
employees, and affecting the Group’s external and internal image.

The Group has already implemented restructuring and reorganisations in the past. Further measures cannot be completely
ruled out in the future. Reorganisation could affect the Group’s relations with its employees, giving rise to labour disputes
such as stoppages, strikes and other forms of disruption that could have a negative effect on the Group’s business
and results.

Labour-related risk management procedures are described in section 6.2 of this Registration Document.

**Quality of working life**

In the prevailing economic and political climate, the Group may be affected by psychosocial risks.

One of the Group’s ambitions is to create the right conditions for employee engagement, motivation and to prevent
work-related stress. To help its managers cope with the growing complexity of their work, the Group has invested in the
promotion of managerial practices that place an emphasis on staff development. The Group has implemented initiatives in
the most appropriate areas of the organisation: listening to employees (telephone helpline, psychological support unit, etc.),
strategic workforce planning, career ladder information, development of skills, optimisation of internal mobility and the annual
deployment of a Personnel Management Cycle whose main objective is to identify, recognise and promote the Group’s best
talents, and also to spot potential talent that could develop towards certain roles of responsibility or prominent positions
within the organisation.

**f)** **Defaulting suppliers or subcontractors**

**i.** **Defaulting subcontractors**

The Group relies on subcontractors for parts of its business, particularly relating to security, cleaning (primarily industrial)
and vehicle chocking. It is possible that some of these subcontractors might fail to fulfil their obligations, which could affect
the Group’s results or financial position.

Subcontractor default risk is managed through the Purchasing Department’s careful supplier selection procedure, as well as
through the monitoring of suppliers’ financial position and close contract management.

**ii.** **Defaulting suppliers**

The rolling stock and some of the Fixed Link installations have been supplied in very small volumes by a very limited number
of suppliers to meet highly specific operating requirements. The Group believes that if its original suppliers were unable to
supply replacement parts or whole Shuttles for any reason, or were unwilling to do so on acceptable terms, it would be able
to obtain suitable materials and equipment from other manufacturers. However, the price or timeframe for such replacements
could have an adverse impact on the Group’s financial position and outlook.

The allocation by SNCF Réseau of poor quality train paths or the unavailability of train paths could harm Europorte’s image
and affect its business despite the signature of a framework agreement with SNCF Réseau in 2013.

Equipment and materials risk is managed through the purchase of reserve stocks, the dynamic (annual or half-yearly) review
of the panel of suppliers, and research into alternative equipment and technologies.

The financial health of a supplier is verified by the Procurement Department, which can request the assistance of the Finance
Department to validate commitments with the companies concerned.

**g)** **Environmental risks**

The Group is subject to French, UK and European environmental regulations, as well as local regulations that require it to
either obtain authorisation for the disposal of certain waste materials or contract an accredited company to remove and
dispose of the waste. Any breach of the environmental regulations would result in a fine for causing pollution. The regulations
also stipulate that the authorities may force the closure of any facility that does not comply with decisions requiring certain
environmentally harmful activities to cease or be modified.

The Group’s environmental protection and sustainable development policy is described in chapter 6 of this Registration
Document. However, there is no guarantee that the United Kingdom, French, European, national or local authorities will not
impose new regulations leading to additional expenditure which could have an adverse impact on the results or financial
position of the Group. Due to the nature of its activities and its potential new projects or developments, the Group, while
being attentive to compliance with applicable environmental regulations, could experience delays in these developments
because of possible constraints or claims.


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

As a local developer, the Group may be subject to the risk of litigation or claims from environmental protection associations,
as is the case with the dispute brought by the environment defence association of Peuplingues and Sangatte against the
decision of the prefect which approved the ElecLink project. This administrative step is not a major risk for the project. No
procedure timetable has been set. The Administrative Court of Lille and the Conseil d’État (highest French administrative
jurisdiction) rejected the same claimants last year stating there was no legal interest in bringing the proceedings in another
procedure.

The management of environmental risks is closely monitored, as stated in chapter 6 of this Registration Document, through
an environmental analysis, which identifies the various risks and assesses their potential impact. The resources required to
minimise this impact can then be identified.

In the United Kingdom, the Concessionaires, as managers of an infrastructure of major importance to the British economy,
were required by DEFRA (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs) to carry out a study under the 2008 Climate
Change Act of the ability of their infrastructure to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change.

**h)** **Societal acceptability**

**The industrial sites and areas in which Europorte operates, and the products transported, present a risk in terms**
**of the environment and industrial safety**

The main customers of Socorail, the Europorte subsidiary specialising in the provision of industrial logistical services, include
actors from the chemical and oil industries subject to the SEVESO classification (hazardous industrial facilities). These
industries are subject to very strict safety regulations, and therefore impose extremely stringent safety criteria on
subcontractors. Although Socorail has ISO 9001 version 2008 and MASE (business safety improvement manual) safety
certification, the danger, toxicity or flammability of some raw materials could cause risks and particularly risks of accidents,
fires, explosions and damage to the environment and wildlife, and could harm the environmental image of Europorte and
the Group. The same applies when Europorte’s rail freight subsidiaries transport various hazardous, toxic or flammable
products. Furthermore, the rail freight haulage business may present environmental risks in the event of a rail accident, due
to the materials transported or the zones crossed.

The industrial safety and environmental risk prevention policy is described in sections 6.2.1 and 6.4.1 of this Registration
Document.

**i)** **Legal risks**

**i.** **Risks relating to the regulated nature of Getlink’s business**

The Group operates in a highly regulated environment, which results in a high degree of dependency on decisions and
measures over which the Group has very little or no influence. Even if regulatory developments bring new market
opportunities for the Group’s activities, they also generate risks. Future changes in regulations, their interpretation or their
application by the regulators, the authorities or the courts can lead to additional costs for the Group and affect its activity, its
financial position and its results. As an example, tightening the measures taken to enforce regulations governing immigration,
customs and excise duty could cause delays or affect customer satisfaction levels. The relevant authorities could also adopt
other stricter rules or rules in new areas that are not currently considered, with similar effect.

The Group is aware of the strong legal and regulatory framework in which it operates and seeks as far as possible to conduct
communication actions and implement measures to safeguard the Group’s interests.

**Fixed Link**

The operation of the Fixed Link is subject to detailed regulations drawn up by the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) and
the Safety Authority. These entities have been set up to monitor, on behalf of the States, all issues related to the construction
and operation of the Tunnel. The Fixed Link is governed by bilateral agreements between France and the United Kingdom
(presented in chapter 8) as well as by constantly evolving European regulation, which includes in particular the European
rail directives[8].

It is necessary to transpose these directives in order to apply them to the Tunnel. These directives can also be subject to
change and interpretation by administrative authorities and courts, and the associated regulations could even be significantly
tightened by national or European authorities. Directive 2012/34/EU provides in particular for the existence of an
independent railway control body. Since the IGC can no longer exercise these functions, they have been conferred on two
national authorities, ARAFER for the French side and the ORR for the British side. This could lead to a risk of discrepancy
between the laws and the interpretation of the texts even more so in the context of the UK’s exit from the European Union,
which for example affects the structure of rail infrastructure tariffs and thus the revenues of the Fixed Link. As indicated in
chapter 8 of this Registration Document, Directive 2016/2370/EU from the fourth rail package, exempts the Fixed Link, as a
public-private partnership not receiving public funds, from the prohibition on intragroup financial flows.

As indicated in chapter 8 of this Registration Document, the Concession Agreement may be terminated by the two States in
the event of force majeure, particularly in the event of war or a serious breach by the Concessionaires of their obligations
under the Concession Agreement. Furthermore, if the Concessionaires should be in breach of their obligations under the

_8_ _Directives 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area and 2016/2370/EU amending the aforementioned Directive as_
_regards the opening up of the market in domestic passenger transport services by rail and the governance of railway infrastructure._
_Directive 2012/34/EU lays down the excepted status of the Fixed Link as an integrated transport system in Article 2.9: “This Directive_
_shall not apply to undertakings the business of which is limited to providing solely shuttle services for road vehicles through undersea_
_tunnels or to transport operations in the form of shuttle services for road vehicles through such tunnels except Article 6(1) and (4) and_
_Articles 10, 11, 12 and 28.”_


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

Concession Agreement, the IGC could impose significant daily penalties. It is within the competence of the IGC to take
decisions that would have a major impact on the activity. The regulatory authorities could also adopt new measures relating
to safety, security or other matters, particularly concerning infrastructure access conditions particularly as part of the ElecLink
project or, more specifically, the development of more rigorous border controls given the current heightened sensitivity to
terrorism. These measures could be strengthened and have an impact on the operations of the Fixed Link, for example by
leading to a reduction in the quality of service and to customer dissatisfaction. The Group works constantly with the national
authorities to minimise the impact of these controls on traffic flows on its terminals.

The Concession Agreement under which the Group operates the Fixed Link may only be modified through amendments
negotiated with the two States. These negotiations could be long and complex. Should it be necessary to make rapid
adjustments because of economic, financial or technical developments affecting the Group, the specific terms of the
Concession Agreement could limit the Group’s ability to adapt or to adjust its business to those developments, which could
in turn affect its results and financial position. However, the obligations under the Concession Agreement require the States
to adopt specific behaviour in the exercise of their functions. The Concessionaires benefit from the Concession Agreement,
which guarantees their rights with regard to the States until 2086. In particular, they have the right to obtain compensation
for damages resulting from a violation of the Concession Agreement by the States.

A dedicated department, the Public Affairs Department, oversees compliance with the rights and duties arising from the
Concession by both the conceding States and the Concessionaires, and liaises between and closely monitors relationships
with IGC, the French regulatory authority ARAFER and the corresponding British regulatory authority ORR, which are
responsible for economic regulation of the Fixed Link, as well as the national and European lawmakers. Since these entities
are independent, the Group cannot exert any influence over them.

**Europorte**

In France, the costs of access to the national rail network are high. As a follow-up to the French Grenelle de l’environnement
(Grenelle environment round table), the public authorities set up subsidies paid by the State to SNCF Réseau on train path
prices, in order to compensate for the increase in charges resulting from SNCF Réseau’s application of principles laid down
by European law (principle of coverage of the directly attributable cost). The State has presented a measure to reduce this
subsidy. A reduction of government funding to SNCF Réseau and a change in the method of calculating toll prices taking
account of train tonnage could significantly increase the operating costs of railway companies, including Europorte. This
would be likely to significantly disrupt the market and the pricing policy, and to threaten the competitiveness of rail freight in
the long term. The lack of predictability in the price of train paths invoiced by SNCF Réseau to Europorte affects the latter.
Europorte is not subsidised by the State.

In the area of transport, the public authorities are recommending the promotion and development of alternative modes of
transport. Encouraging a modal shift from road to rail is one of the main levers of this policy. Yet, France’s secondary rail
network, which was historically very dense, has been neglected and, following a lack of maintenance and use, is gradually
being dismantled. However, this network is essential to the survival of rail freight, since it allows a large part of freight flows
to be channelled into the main network. Without political will on the part of the players responsible for developing transport
infrastructure and the implications of that lack of political will for the modal shift in strategy, the progressive deterioration or
eventual disappearance of the feeder networks could have a major impact on Europorte’s revenue.

The new harmonised social framework for railway worker employment conditions (both freight and passenger) is one of the
pillars of railway reform. A foundation decree sets common rules for organisation and working time, guaranteeing “safety
and continuity of public service requirements”. This decree was supplemented by a sector agreement and a company
agreement that does not call into question Europorte’s productivity efforts.

In view of the external risks arising from changes in the contributions allocated by the French State and the implementation
of a harmonised labour framework in France, the Group continues negotiations and is undertaking all possible actions to
communicate and defend its interests with the relevant parties.

**ii.** **Risks related to non-compliance with competition law**

The provisions of competition law, the application of which is controlled by the French and British competition authorities
and the European Commission, applies to the Group’s entities in the countries in which they are active (France and the
United Kingdom). Violation of competition law is punishable with fines and, in certain countries, can render the individuals
involved liable to criminal sanctions. Any proceedings initiated by a competition authority could, in the event of a guilty
verdict, give rise to the payment of fines and, where appropriate, damages and interest, which could have a significant
impact on the image of the Group, its financial position and its results.

The Group’s management of legal risks is carefully monitored by several departments and, in particular, by the Group’s
Legal Department through a monitoring procedure and meetings with the relevant operational departments.

**iii.** **Risks related to failure to meet contractual obligations**

Like any business, the Group is, by definition, exposed to risks related to failure to meet its contractual obligations to its
customers, suppliers, employees and financial partners.

**Customers**

The Concessionaires’ obligations to the Railways under the Railway Usage Contract which ends in 2052, or to Railway
Companies under the Network Statement, and the consequences of failing to meet those obligations are detailed in
chapter 8 of this Registration Document. It cannot be ruled out that the Railways may wish, before the end of the Railway
Usage Contract, to renegotiate it or dispute certain of its provisions. The Group did not see any significant reduction in the
Railways’ contributions to its fixed annual charges in 2017 as a result of unavailability of the Fixed Link.


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

In the context of monitoring this risk, the Railway Network Department is in continuous discussion with the Railway
Companies: in June 2015, the Concessionaires and Eurostar agreed a Railway Usage Contract application agreement
covering contributions to operating, maintenance and renewals costs of the Fixed Link railway infrastructure for the years
2015 to 2019 inclusive. In accordance with European Directives, this agreement was negotiated under the auspices of the
IGC in its role as railway regulator, to ensure compliance with transparency, equality and non-discrimination requirements.

As part of its transportation activity, the Group carries passenger vehicles and trucks on board its Shuttles and is exposed
to the risk of failure to fulfil its contractual commitments to its customers. The Group’s commitments to its clients (passenger
vehicles and trucks on board its Shuttles) are governed by its general conditions of carriage.

The growth in Europorte’s activity is exposed to the risk of dependence on keys customers. Within its rail freight transport
and industrial site management business, Europorte has taken into account the risk of dependency on key customers in its
strategic plan.

**Suppliers**

The Group is exposed to the risk of failure to fulfil its contractual commitments to its suppliers.

The risk of default by suppliers and subcontractors is detailed in section 3.1.2 of this Registration Document.

The Group’s purchasing procedures and general purchasing conditions set forth the terms of payment for supplier invoices.
The conditions applied by the Group in France are compliant with the obligations defined in the French law on economic
modernisation of 4 August 2008. The Group has established systems and procedures for processing supplier invoices to
make sure that they are paid in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.

The following table shows the payment schedule for the Group’s trade receivables at 31 December 2017 and 2016:

**iv.** **Financial partners**

The undertakings under the Group’s Term Loan are described in chapter 8. These undertakings, combined with the level of
the Group’s debt, could affect its ability to obtain additional financing in the future and limit its ability to react to changes that
affect its business or the markets in which it operates. These loans could become subject to early repayment in full should
the Group breach certain of its contractual obligations, or in the event of occurrence of the events or defaults mentioned in
chapter 8 and note G to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

As indicated in section 1.1.2 of this Registration Document, the Group has adapted its legal organisation to enable the
introduction of a more flexible financing structure and thereby continue developing the Group, ensuring its ability to create
value in the long term.

As part of its risk management procedures, the Finance Department continually monitors the Group’s commitments and
restrictions within the framework of the Treasury Risk Management Committee. The tasks and objectives of this committee
are part of the internal control system as detailed in section 3.4.2 of this Registration Document.

**v.** **GET SE’s main shareholder holds a significant percentage of the capital and voting rights**

The main shareholders of Groupe Eurotunnel SE indicated in section 7.4 of this Registration Document could be in a position
to exert influence at a general meeting on the Group’s corporate decisions requiring shareholder approval. As indicated in
chapter 7 of this Registration Document, these shareholders disclosed in their respective statements of intent to the AMF,
notably on 29 January 2018 for TCI, that they do not hold their investment with the intent to implement a specific strategy or
to exercise significant influence over the company.[9]

Should one of these shareholders decide to sell a significant number of ordinary shares on the market, the share price could
be affected depending on market conditions at the time of the sale, on the terms and volume of the sale, on the reasons for
the sale and on the general public’s perception of these reasons.

The organisation of corporate governance within the Group (number of independent Board Directors, Board committees) as
described in chapter 4 of this Registration Document seeks to mitigate this risk. Every year, the Group strengthens its
relationship with investors and shareholders to encourage high-quality constructive dialogue and keep the Board of Directors
informed of their expectations.

**j)** **Risks related to information systems**

In 2017, cybercrimes against companies, public bodies and individuals have demonstrated that digitalising company
processes brings new risks. Cyber security is a key issue that must go hand in hand with digitalisation. This challenge was

_9_ _Since approval of the management report on 20 February 2018, Aero has changed control, as indicated in section 2.3 of this Registration_
_Document._

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

identified as an absolute priority at the highest level of Group management and is taken into account as early as the system
design phase.

Cyber security governance is led by an information systems security committee bringing together all Group departments.
This committee identifies risks, reviews management and audit reports and monitors implementation of action plans.
Operating teams, assisted by service providers certified by the French National Agency for Information Systems Security,
work continually to improve cyber security in three key areas: protecting systems, employees and sub-contractors, detecting
unusual activity and drafting multi-scenario crisis management plans. These challenges remain a priority for 2018 and
coming years, so that in 2017 the Group implemented an ambitious digital plan to enrich and improve the services offered
to its customers and optimise the efficiency of internal processes. Collaborative working systems, mobile applications and
Big Data and Cloud solutions are being developed rapidly.

**k)** **Risk of internal control failure**

The Group has established an internal control system which, however refined it may be, can only provide a reasonable
assurance that business objectives will be achieved, since there are inherent limits to any control. The Group cannot exclude
the risk of internal control failure that may expose it, in particular, to identity theft and, more generally, fraud.

**3.2** **LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**

In the course of its business, the Group and its subsidiaries can be involved, like any company, in various administrative,
legal or arbitration procedures, the most significant of which are discussed in more detail below.

More generally, it cannot be ruled out that, in the future, new legal proceedings, whether related to ongoing proceedings or
not, could be brought against any of the Group’s entities or their legal representatives. Were such proceedings to have an
unfavourable outcome, they could have an adverse impact on the business, financial position or results of the Group, its
image or that of its corporate officers.

The Legal, Public Affairs, Human Resources and Finance Departments work to resolve ongoing and potential disputes, and
to improve procedures to minimise the risk of litigation.

**_3.2.1 SIGNIFICANT PROCEEDINGS_**

**a)** **Litigation relating to the cessation of the maritime activity**

The cessation of the maritime activity on 1 July 2015 has led to several proceedings, including by the liquidator of SCOP
SeaFrance and the AGS (the French insolvency fund for the management of employee claims) as well as the legal challenge
by DFDS as to the exercise price of the put options for the two ferries.

During the sale of the ships, DFDS notified the Group that it disagreed with the option exercise price. It has since brought a
claim in arbitration for restitution of part of the purchase price. The Group considers that the amount paid corresponds to the
terms of the agreement. The arbitration case will be heard in the second half of 2018.

The liquidator of SCOP SeaFrance, ex-charterer of the ships, has brought a claim before the Commercial Court in France
to obtain payment of an alleged debt based on charter party and capacity contracts concluded between MyFerryLink SAS
and SCOP SeaFrance. SCOP SeaFrance’s claim was unsuccessful before the Commercial Court of Lille; it then decided to
bring a claim before the Commercial Court of Boulogne-sur-Mer which has not set a procedure timetable (such a timetable
is not mandatory, it depends on each court). MyFerryLink SAS has a significant receivable on SCOP SeaFrance in respect
of penalties for the late delivery of ships. This receivable is impaired.

On 1 December 2017, the liquidator filed an action before the enforcement judge to obtain payment of the penalty imposed
by the Commercial Court of Boulogne-sur-Mer concerning the communication of certain documents. The enforcement judge
set the penalty. An appeal has been filed with the Court of Appeal covering the very principle of communicating the disputed
documents and the amount of the penalty.

On 12 May 2017, the liquidator also filed an action before the Commercial Court of Paris to obtain recognition of the existence
of a de facto partnership between SCOP SeaFrance, GET SE and its maritime subsidiaries. The Commercial Court rejected
all of the liquidator’s claims and ordered it to pay court costs in a judgment delivered on 30 January 2018[10].

The AGS (wage guarantee insurance association) brought a claim before the Commercial Court of Paris in August 2016 to
obtain the reimbursement of the sums paid to SCOP SeaFrance as salary debts. The claim concerns the corporate owners
of the ships and the holding company, as well as MyFerryLink SAS and GET SE. The proceedings are at the pre-trial stage.

The Société d’Exploitation des Ports du Détroit (the company operating the ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer) brought
a claim before the Commercial Court of Lille to obtain payment of port fees in relation to the mooring of the Rodin and Berlioz
ships during the summer of 2015. The Group contests the claim on the grounds that the operator alone, namely SCOP
SeaFrance, is responsible for such fees.

**b)** **Litigation relating to the Fixed Link activity**

The expertise carried out at the Concession site following the 2008 fire is ending and the Group is waiting for the report. The
case is expected to go before the court to process the claims of carriers, which have been frozen since 2008. The Group’s
insurance policies cover such claims and the Group’s interests will be defended by its third-party liability insurer.

_10 Since approval of the management report on 20 February 2018, on 8 March 2018, the liquidator lodged an appeal against this judgment._

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

In 2016, France-Manche SA was indicted following a workplace accident in 2011 during work in the Tunnel involving a
subcontractor. The criminal investigation is still in progress and may last several years. Within the Group, no physical person,
with a managerial position or not, has been indicted. Staff and subcontractors’ safety and security always come first for the
Group, as indicated in section 6.2.1 of this Registration Document.

**c)** **Litigation relating to Europorte activity**

Following a tendering process launched by the Grand Port Maritime de Bordeaux (GPMB) to operate the Verdon port
terminal, Europorte entered into a terminal operator agreement with GMPB, and a contract for port handling services with
Société de Manutention Portuaire Aquitaine (SMPA) in 2015.

In 2016, following discussions between the various stakeholders aimed at establishing the necessary conditions to start
operating the terminal, in what was a difficult social and competitive environment, Europorte terminated the above contracts
in application of the relevant contractual provisions. GPMB nonetheless decided to substitute the initial contractor for SMPA,
at Europorte’s risk and expense. This decision was initially overturned by the Administrative Court of Bordeaux but later
upheld by a Council of State order dated 14 February 2017. Several actions are ongoing before the Bordeaux Court to
cancel this decision (proceedings on the merits) and to contest the late payment penalties and occupation fees invoiced to
Europorte by GPMB.

SMPA has been unable to operate the Verdon port terminal. Its appointment will end on 21 March 2018 pursuant to the
provisions of the port terminal agreement. On 7 July 2017, GPMB launched a new tendering process to award a new port
terminal agreement.

By order dated 28 June 2017, receivership proceedings have been launched before the Commercial Court of Bordeaux in
respect of SMPA. The proceedings were extended pending the results of the tendering process. On 23 December 2017,
SMPA brought an action against Europorte before the Commercial Court of Bordeaux to obtain compensation for alleged
damages.

**d)** **Tax audit**

The Group operates in two countries applying different tax systems. Tax regulations are constantly evolving and are subject
to interpretation. The Group cannot guarantee that its interpretation will not be challenged, which could lead to negative
consequences on its finances and/or results. The Group performs standard monitoring of tax matters. The audits of its
accounts launched by the tax authorities for the years 2010 to 2012 have now been completed and the Group is considering
the outcome. As the Group seeks to comply with tax laws and regulations that apply locally, it uses a network of tax
professionals to ensure compliance with its obligations and limit the tax risk to a reasonable and usual level.

**_3.2.2 IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROFITABILITY OF THE GROUP_**

As far as it is aware, and subject to the paragraphs above, the Group and its subsidiaries have not during the last twelve
months been involved in any judicial or governmental proceedings or arbitration that is ongoing or suspended, which could
have or has had a significant negative effect on its financial position or profitability.

As at 31 December 2017, the amount of provisions for all litigation or procedural risks in which the Group is involved amounts
to €13 million.

**3.3** **INSURANCE AND RISK COVERAGE**

Getlink’s insurance programmes consist primarily of policies covering material damage and business interruption (including
terrorism) and third-party liability.

Regarding the Fixed Link, the insurance policy for damage to property and operating losses (including terrorism) covers up
to a total limit of €700 million, now in a single layer. The policy was renegotiated and renewed on 1 January 2017 for a period
of three years, ending on 31 December 2019.

The third-party liability policy taken out by the Group (except specific programmes) was also renegotiated and renewed on
1 January 2017 for a period of three years, ending on 31 December 2019 for the first layer and for a period of two years,
ending on 31 December 2018 for the excess layers.

The specific insurance programme for EPF, EPP and Socorail which was already in place, has been renewed for the period
1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018. It includes, in particular, cover for material damage and business interruption,
third-party liability and environmental damage.

In certain circumstances, payments by insurance companies under existing insurance guarantees may not be sufficient to
cover all of the loss suffered. Losses in excess of the agreed indemnity limits or the application of deductibles or certain
exclusion clauses could result in the Group incurring unforeseen costs, affect its business, financial position or results.

In addition, changes to the insurance market and the occurrence of operational incidents could lead to an adverse change
in the Group’s insurance programme and the terms and conditions of such insurance, such as the level of premiums, the
level of insurance deductibles and the scope of any exclusions which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial position or results.

As part of these risk management procedures, the Group constantly monitors the adequacy of coverage and actions to be
undertaken. In 2017, the insurance coverage was sufficient for its needs.

**3.4** **INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES**

The control environment, which is essential to the internal control system, to good risk management and to the application
of procedures, relies on behaviour, organisation and employees. It is part of a culture of commitment and rigour
communicated by the Group. Individual and collective commitment is essential to the adoption of behaviour founded on
integrity and transparency, in order to act ethically and contribute to the long-term success of the Group.

The aim of the various policies approved by the Board is to develop a culture of ethical practice and compliance. The
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer sends out a strong message of “zero tolerance”, in particular in the fight against
corruption.

This section presents the internal control and risk management measures taken by the Group, including management of
ethics and compliance risk.

**_3.4.1 DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT_**

**a)** **Legal and reference framework**

Pursuant to article L. 225-10061 of the French Commercial Code, the Groupe Eurotunnel SE Board of Directors presents,
in its management report, the main aspects of the internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the
company for the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.

This report was drafted in keeping with the Reference Framework recommended by the AMF (French financial markets
regulator) dated 22 July 2010.

The report was examined by the Audit Committee and then reviewed and finalised by the Board of GET SE on 20 February
2018.

**b)** **Definition, objectives and scope of internal control and risk management**

Internal control is a system comprising a combination of means, processes, behaviour, procedures and actions adapted to
the specific features of each company. It contributes to the effective management of the company’s business, the efficiency
of its operations and the efficient use of its resources and should enable it to appropriately factor in all significant risks, be
they operational, financial or compliance.

Specifically, the system seeks to ensure:

compliance with the laws and regulations in force;

the application of instructions set by the general management;

the proper functioning of the internal processes, particularly those related to safeguarding its tangible and intangible
assets;

the reliability of financial information.

Internal control is not restricted to a set of procedures or mere accounting and financial processes and it does not encompass
all the initiatives undertaken by corporate or management bodies.

The internal control and risk management system extends throughout the Group and to all its subsidiaries included in the
consolidated financial statements.

Since 2015, as part of its continuous improvement approach, the Group has taken the following actions to strengthen the
internal control and risk management system:

the procedures have been structured, updated and enhanced for the Group and the business units;

the register of Group risks, based on a reference framework common to all subsidiaries, and the individual registers for
each subsidiary as set up in 2013, were updated during the 2017 annual review.

**_3.4.2 COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS_**

**a)** **Risk management procedures**

The objective of the Group’s risk management process is to enable general management and the Board to:

have an overall, consistent and structured view of all types of major risks to which the business is exposed and changes
therein; and

assess the appropriateness of the mitigating measures implemented by those responsible for managing each of the risks
in the light of their potential impact on the strategic objectives.

Risk management contributes to creating and preserving the Group’s value, assets and reputation. It provides greater
security in the business’s decision making and in its processes, which promotes the achievement of its objectives. It fosters
consistency between the business’s actions and its values and seeks to mobilise the Group’s employees around a common
vision of the main risks and to promote awareness among them of the risks inherent in their work.

**i.** **Identification and analysis of risks**

This first stage allows the key risks that threaten the achievement of the objectives to be identified and consolidated. A risk
can be either a threat or a missed opportunity. It is characterised by an event, which has one or more sources and one or


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

more consequences. This identification will be followed by an analysis which involves examining the potential consequences
of the key risks (consequences that may be financial, human, legal or related to reputation) and estimating the likelihood
that they may occur. This dual approach is a continuous process.

**ii.** **Risk management**

The risk management system is monitored and regularly reviewed with a view to its ongoing improvement. The aim is to
identify and assess key potential risks and draw lessons from incidents.

The process includes a formal annual review presented to the Audit Committee and, subsequently, to the Board of GET SE,
at the end of the financial year under consideration. The risk reviews are based on the strategic plan applicable at the date
of the relevant review.

Risk reviews are coordinated by the person in charge of risk management in the organisation. These reviews help to assess
the risks facing the business and to identify and assess the mitigating measures put in place to manage them. They enable
a risk mapping.

The process, which consists primarily of formal interviews with directors and senior management across the business,
comprises two parallel approaches:

  a top-down approach, consisting of the identification of the risks linked to strategic initiatives (both from the point of view
of their direct effect on the business and the knock-on effect that they may generate on pre-existing risks) and changes
in the business’s economic environment; and

  a traditional bottom-up approach which seeks to identify risks in each of the main business areas (commercial,
technical/operational, financial, staff, safety and security, environment and corporate governance).

This approach is enriched each year and in 2017, a mapping of corruption risk was added to identify, analyse and prioritise
the Group’s risk of exposure to external solicitations for corruption purposes. In 2018, a specific focus will be placed on the
risk of fraud.

The Group’s Financial Control Department, with the main business units and senior management, continued to measure in
2017 the risk appetite approved by the Board, as the level of risk that the Group is willing to take in a given area in order to
achieve its objectives. Risk appetite can be expressed through quantitative and qualitative criteria. The Group’s appetite for
risk is implemented by the executive officers and applied by departments of the various entities and functional departments,
through:

  governance (bodies and decision mechanisms, supervision and monitoring);

  supervision (identifying key risks to watch, risk management policies comprising limits); and

  monitoring (budget monitoring, reporting).

**iii.** **Treatment and monitoring of risks**

Each risk is assigned a level of control that corresponds to the systems of selecting and implementing the measures aimed
at mitigating the risk. The company may envisage a number of measures: reduction, transfer, deletion or acceptance of a
risk. The choice of how to manage a risk will involve weighing opportunities against the costs of risk management measures,
while also taking account of their possible effects on the likelihood and/or consequences of the risk occurring. The controls
to be put in place fall under the scope of the internal control system. In this way, the internal control system contributes to
the management of risks incurred in the business’s activities.

Risk Management and Internal Audit continually monitor major risks and new or emerging risks and any significant changes
are reported to the Executive Committee and to the Audit Committee.

**b)** **Internal control components**

Internal control comprises five closely related components, as follows:

  control environment;

  risk assessment;

  control activities;

  information and communication;

  monitoring.

They are implemented by the Group as follows:

**i.** **Control environment**

The control environment, which is key to the internal control system and essential for good risk management and procedural
application, is based on human behaviour and is the foundation for other internal control elements.

Getlink’s control environment is based on the following components:

  A general human resources policy which sets out the Group’s values and operating principles, as well as the key
measures in place in relation to working conditions and practices, staff training and development and standards
of conduct.

  The interest shown by the Board of Directors in internal control and general management’s will to continuously improve
operational processes.


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

A definition of responsibilities through a company organisation chart, distributed on the intranet and the introduction of a
delegation of authority procedure and approval limits.

The existence of a body of operating policies and procedures, documented for all the main business segments.

The existence of a formal monthly reporting process and regular budget reviews ensuring the business’s good financial
management.

**ii.** **Risk assessment**

Every business is faced with external and internal risks that may prevent the full realisation of its objectives.

The Group relies on several processes to identify the risks and take them into account:

The annual budget and five-year plan set the operating and commercial objectives in the business’s main fields of activity
and the financial results expected. They are presented to the Board of Directors of Groupe Eurotunnel SE after having
been reviewed by the Audit Committee.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are established for the main identified risk areas, including safety, commercial
performance and operational reliability. The members of the Executive Committee are informed of the state of these
indicators on a weekly basis.

An annual risk review as described in section a) above.

**iii.** **Control activities**

Control activities proportionate to the specific challenges of each process seek to ensure that the necessary measures are
taken to control the risks likely to impact the attainment of objectives. Application of standards and procedures contributes
to the implementation of management directives. Control activities are carried out at all hierarchical and functional levels of
the company. For each business area, specific measures are recommended to respect the key points of internal control.

The Compliance Department steers the implementation of compliance action plans (drawing-up policies, making tools
available, policy implementation support, awareness and training actions) in close collaboration with all the departments
concerned, including Internal Control, the Legal Department and the Human Resources Department, under the direction of
Internal Audit. Assessment of ethical risks is an integral part of the analysis approach of the Group and its subsidiaries.
Responsibility for ethics and compliance is exercised at all levels of management. A Securities Ethics Charter, in place since
2010 and regularly updated, sets out the measures to prevent insider trading and establishes so-called “trading close
periods”.

With regard to professional ethics and compliance, the Board’s Ethics and Governance Committee – renamed the Corporate
Committee – launched the implementation of the Ethics and Governance Code, which refers to all the procedures. This
Committee ensures the communication within the Group of an ethical culture and principles and thus inspires the work of
the other Board committees and executive and corporate officers.

In accordance with the “zero tolerance” message promoted by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer with respect to all
types of corruption, the Group has defined a rigorous corruption risk prevention programme which is applicable to all Group
entities and is founded on employee training and information campaigns to raise awareness of major fraud and corruption
risks. An anti-corruption policy and whistleblowing system have been implemented. All employees can contact the Group’s
ethics officer if they consider that communicating information to a line manager could present difficulties or not result in the
proper follow-up. A mapping of corruption and fraud risks has been prepared to identify, analyse and prioritise the Group’s
risk of exposure to corruption and influence peddling.

In addition, since 30 September 2017, companies are liable if an associated person (including employees, customers and
suppliers) criminally facilitates tax evasion in the United Kingdom or abroad (UK Criminal Finances Act 2017). The Group
has mapped its risk of exposure to facilitating tax evasion and the appropriate prevention procedures are now in place.

With regard to Human Resources, the French Group Committee was set up in 2014 to provide an opportunity for the mutual
sharing of information, an exchange of viewpoints and dialogue between French employee representatives and the Group’s
management on strategic objectives and key staff issues and to keep employees abreast of developments and the future
outlook for the Group. A European Company Committee brings together staff representatives in France and the
United Kingdom (trade union or elected representatives) and Group management: this consultation and dialogue body at
European level provides a forum for communicating information on the major issues concerning the European Company. A
Group intranet, set up in 2014, enables each and every employee to have access to information on his or her subsidiary
and on Getlink, particularly where internal control procedures are concerned. With regard to payroll functions, formal
procedures are in place and strict segregation of duties is applied for the key stages of the payroll process.

In the area of Corporate Social Responsibility, the Group has adopted a formal CSR policy (signed on 13 March 2015) and
upheld and supported at the highest level of the organisation by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. It outlines the
principles and the commitments of the Group, describes the social, territorial, environmental, economic and ethical
challenges, and defines the commitments to be met. Moreover, since 2013, the Group is signatory to the United Nations
Global Compact and has fully embraced its ten key principles, notably those relating to human rights and employment law.

With regard to procurement, the Code of Conduct for Purchasing, brought up to date in 2011, is the guide to practices and
ethics that enables each employee to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. It also helps develop a climate of
trust between Group representatives and persons outside the business. Formal purchasing procedures and delegations of
authority are in place for the management and approval of purchases. In addition, a Responsible Supplier Charter has been
in place since 2010, to build lasting and balanced relationships between customers and suppliers. Finally, the call for tender
procedures specify the conditions of competition and referencing for the main suppliers.

In respect of safety, procedures related to the protection of people, goods and data underpin the risk cover principles in
terms of organisation and safety. The Board’s Safety and Security Committee monitors performance in these areas by


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

means of quarterly reports from the Security and Sustainable Development Department. These include the reporting of
safety performance against target, the results of safety evaluations and an update on security matters. The Safety and
Security Committee has created two subgroups, one responsible for emergency planning and the BINAT exercises and the
other for security issues. Furthermore, a formal document entitled SGS (security management system) is updated as
necessary and at least once every five years by the Safety and Sustainable Development Department. This document
identifies the major risks to which the company’s customers, employees, sub-contractors and visitors are exposed, and the
measures in place to manage them. The SGS is formally approved by the IGC in its capacity as Safety Authority.

With regard to information systems, risks associated with data and system integrity are covered by procedures and controls
that are integrated in the systems themselves. The Group has an IT tool user guide which allows all employees to share
best practice and levels of control that are adapted to the level of risk exposure. This policy is accompanied by an information
systems safety audit programme carried out by an external firm.

With regard to legal issues, the current structure ensures that within each business segment and department, French, British
and European legislation is complied with, particularly in the areas of competition and personal data protection.

In respect of insurance, the Group chooses to call only on top ranking insurers. It uses programmes to cover, in particular,
the third party liability of all its entities and material damage and business interruption consequent upon a covered loss. An
analysis of the relevance of insurance coverage is carried out every three years, and is revised during the renewal of
insurance policies.

With regard to treasury activities, a corporate Treasury Risk Management Committee (TRMC) regularly examines
fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and the use of financial instruments, as well as monitoring cash flows, liquidity
and compliance with the restrictions imposed by banking agreements. The investment and cash management policies are
approved annually by the Board of Directors of Groupe Eurotunnel SE. The treasury plan enables monitoring within a
foreseeable time-scale of the liquidity of each of the various Group entities.

The accounting and finance control activities are presented separately in section 3.4.3 below.

**iv.** **Internal information and communication**

The Group ensures the internal distribution of relevant and reliable information, knowledge of which enables each individual
to exercise their responsibilities.

The Board of Directors of Groupe Eurotunnel SE is regularly provided with the information that it requires:

  annually, the strategic plan and the annual budget;

  monthly, a report containing information on financial results and the financial position and a summary of the operational
and commercial performance.

The Audit Committee, the Nominations Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Safety and Security Committee, the
Corporate Committee and the Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee of the Board of Groupe Eurotunnel SE receive
reports of concern to them at each of their periodic meetings. The chairmen of these committees keep the Board of Directors
of Groupe Eurotunnel SE informed of the work of their committees.

The members of the Executive Committee of Groupe Eurotunnel SE receive the following documents for their information:

  monthly, a report on the financial results and analysis of performance in relation to the budget;

  monthly, a “dashboard” containing the key performance indicators for each business segment (safety, commercial
performance and market share, productivity and operational reliability, quality of service, employee headcount and
related statistics, financial results with comparison against the budget and against the most recent forecasts);

  weekly, a report setting out key information related to safety, human resources, operations, and to commercial and
financial performance.

Regular communication with Group personnel is achieved through the Group intranet, launched in 2014, which allows each
employee to obtain information on the Group’s main activities and on new policies and procedures applicable within the
company. In addition, a newsletter is produced for each subsidiary. Periodic meetings called the Management Forum, bring
together the Group’s key managers for general discussions.

**v.** **Monitoring and supervision**

Monitoring entails periodic assessment of the internal control system. It forms part of the Group’s day-to-day operations,
and includes regular management and supervisory activities, as well as the work carried out by the audit functions. During
2017 and up to the date of this Registration Document, the Group has not identified any major shortcomings in its internal
control system.

Monitoring and supervision falls under the responsibility of the Board of Groupe Eurotunnel SE, and the following parties:

**General management**

The mission of general management is to define the key aspects of the risk management and internal control systems and
to ensure their implementation. To do so, it is supported by the operational departments.

**The Audit Committee**

Twice a year, the Committee examines the internal audit plan and its objectives, as well as the general conclusions of
internal audit missions. The initiatives and projects that shape internal control are also presented to it. The Audit Committee
then reports on its activities to the Board.


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

**The Group Financial Control Department**

The Group Financial Control Department is responsible for all finance functions within the Group, through its centralised
functions (planning, reporting, consolidation, tax matters, accounting and cash) and through its functional links with the
financial director of each segment. It encourages a sound understanding of the Group’s internal control rules as well as their
dissemination and proper application, and it monitors the progress of internal control and risk management projects.

The Risk Management and Internal Control Department reports to the Group’s Financial Control Department. This
department is responsible for implementation and monitoring of the key risk map in order to minimise the impact of adverse
events and fully capitalise on opportunities. It is also tasked with the development and deployment of internal control
throughout the entire Group. Alongside professional experts, it coordinates the implementation of projects and internal
control tasks decided by executive officers.

**The Internal Audit Department**

The Internal Audit Department reports to the Group’s general management. Twice a year, the Head of Internal Audit reports
to the Audit Committee on the work undertaken by his department. Internal Audit plans audit work in order to ensure
appropriate coverage of all the main risk factors and it submits an audit plan to the Audit Committee. A formal process exists
for the correction of weaknesses highlighted in internal audit reports. The status of corrective actions is presented to the
Audit Committee.

The Internal Audit Department comprises a central team which performs regular consulting and assurance assignments in
the business units, as well as on corporate or cross-departmental subjects. For each assignment, a report is drawn up
stating the general opinion on the level of control over the risks inherent to the activity concerned, and the findings identified
as well as its recommendations in the form of an action plan to be implemented by the audited entity. This report is passed
on to the functional department concerned and to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and to the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer.

An integral part of the corporate risk assessment, Internal Audit takes part in the annual risk review and assesses the
appropriateness and effectiveness of measures in place to mitigate the identified risks. The results of the corporate risk
assessment and the internal audit review are presented to the Audit Committee.

The Internal Audit Department maps the insurance activities showing the extent of coverage for the major risks faced by the
organisation. In particular, Internal Audit consults the Safety and Security Committee each year to identify all the insurance
activity requirements in these areas.

Since 2012, the Internal Audit Department has been certified by IFACI (Institut Français de l’Audit et du Contrôle Internes –
the French Audit and Internal Control Institute), under the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) for the
internal audit profession. In 2015, the IFACI certification was renewed.

**Specific committees**

The Group has a number of specific committees:

the investment committee which endorses the Group’s major investment projects,

the commitments committee which endorses the key sales and purchasing contracts of the Group’s various entities,

the treasury risk management committee,

the steering compliance committee.

The Concessionaires have set up operational committees for the following specific areas:

safety committee,

operating performance committee (service quality and customer experience),

risk committee,

IT development committee,

information systems security committee bringing together all Group departments to identify cyber security risks.

Specific monitoring groups oversee progress achieved in key projects.

**_3.4.3 INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF FINANCIAL_**

**_AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION_**

**a)** **Monitoring the accounting and financial structure**

**i.** **Structure**

Corporate general management is responsible for preparing the Group’s parent and consolidated financial statements and
implementing the internal control systems related to finance and accounting. To this end, it has put in place a monitoring
function to identify and manage the main risks that could potentially impact the preparation of accounting and financial
information published by the Group:

it ensures the Group has the organisation and resources in place to guarantee that the financial statements reflect its
transactions accurately and in full;

it oversees, via the management reporting processes, the reliability of the published accounting and financial information;


-----

###### 3 RISKS AND CONTROLS

  it supervises the preparation and year-end closing of the financial statements, paying particular attention to the
accounting treatment of major or complex transactions, the quality of estimates used in the consolidated financial
statements and the year-end closing procedures that are considered sensitive; and

  it is informed of the statutory auditors’ conclusions drawn from their work on the parent company and consolidated
financial statements. It also keeps itself abreast of any significant risks or major weakness in internal control notified by
the statutory auditors and makes sure that these are addressed by the corrective actions implemented by the Group.

Financial management is centralised in the Group’s Financial Control Department, which is responsible for defining the
Group’s accounting rules and policies, cash management, consolidation of the Group financial statements and financial
reporting. This centralised responsibility covers all the Group accounting entities in France and the UK.

Accounts management is performed by each entity in accordance with the Group’s accounting principles. Data is then
passed to the Group’s Financial Control Department for consolidation.

The Audit Committee plays a crucial role in controlling the Group’s financial reporting and in preparatory work for the approval
of the annual financial statements and consideration of the interim financial statements by the Board, in particular:

  any changes to accounting policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee;

  the Group Financial Control Department submits a report to the Audit Committee on major accounting and reporting
issues and options at each accounts closing;

  the Audit Committee reviews the annual and half-year consolidated financial statements before their presentation to the
GET SE Board;

  at these meetings, the Committee receives formal reports drawn up by the statutory auditors, financial management,
internal audit, and treasury and risk management.

**ii.** **The accounting rules**

The quality of accounting and financial information relies on observance of the accounting rules and principles during both
the accounts production process and the year-end closing process, to ensure that the information contained in the financial
statements is true and fair.

The rules to be observed for accounts production and in the upstream processes are the following: truthfulness of
transactions and events recorded, completeness of all transactions and events, accurate measurement of transactions
amounts, the accruals principle and appropriate classification of transactions and events in the accounts.

The rules to be observed for the year-end closing process are the following: existence of assets and liabilities, rights and
obligations, completeness of assets and liabilities, accurate measurement and allocation of assets and liabilities, appropriate
presentation and intelligibility of the financial information, truthfulness of rights and obligations, accurate measurement and
assessment of financial information.

These rules are set forth in written procedures and cover all operations performed by the Group’s Financial Control
Department; they are accessible and are conveyed to the various Group entities.

**iii.** **Organisation and security of information systems**

A single integrated accounting system, SAP ECC, is used across all accounting entities except ElecLink. The upload of
transactions and accounting data from other SAP modules is automatic. For systems outside the integrated SAP
environment – principally in the areas of passenger sales – accounting data uploads are automated. Reconciliation and
verification controls are in place to ensure the completeness and accuracy of these interfaces.

The IT systems and environment are organised to ensure secure, reliable, accessible and relevant provision of accounting
and financial information. Controls are in place to ensure the physical security of hardware and software, the integrity of data
and the continuity of operation of the major computer systems. The Group has set up protection measures to strengthen its
systems in the face of increasing risks of unauthorised intrusion into information systems and its possible consequences,
from inappropriate access to loss of data.

**b)** **Processes involved in the preparation of accounting and financial information**

**i.** **Transaction accounting**

The reliability of published financial information depends on adequate controls over the transactions giving rise to accounting
entries to ensure they are accurate, complete and compliant with the standards in force. These controls are applied for all
processes feeding into the accounts, particularly operating revenue, purchases, inventory control, fixed assets, payroll and
treasury, in addition to capital transactions and provisions and commitments. The month-end closures, including detailed
verification of the main revenue and expenditure accounts, are carried out by the budget controllers. Formal balance sheet
reconciliations are also carried out by the accounts department.

Financial and management accounting is integrated and prepared using the same source data. Monthly reconciliations are
carried out between management accounting data and the accounting data used to prepare the published accounting and
financial information.

**ii.** **Consolidation**

  Consolidation of the financial statements of the various Group entities is carried out centrally by the Group’s Financial
Control Department, which ensures that the scope and rules of consolidation are kept up to date.

  There is a formal process for preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements that includes:

      - advance reporting dates allowing the Group to anticipate the accounting treatment of complex transactions;


-----

###### RISKS AND CONTROLS 3

   - publication by the Group’s Financial Control Department of a timetable and period-end closing instructions for the
subsidiaries;

   - preparation of consolidation packages by subsidiaries to ensure standardisation in the application of Group
accounting policies and in the information reported in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**iii.** **External communication of financial information**

An annual timetable is drawn up by the Group’s Financial Control Department setting out the periodic obligations related to
the provision of accounting and financial communications to the market. This schedule, which specifies the nature and timing
of each disclosure and the person responsible for its preparation, is sent to everyone involved in the process.

Formal processes are in place to ensure that:

information is communicated externally in a timely manner and in compliance with the laws and regulations in force;

sensitive information remains confidential;

all information, including non-accounting information presented in support of financial communications, is checked
before release;

information meeting the definition of inside information is communicated to the market at the right time, in compliance
with the relevant rules.

**iv.** **Statutory auditors**

Independently of the Group’s Financial Control Department, the statutory auditors, as part of their work to audit and certify
the financial statements, carry out a review of the internal control procedures used to prepare and ensure the quality of the
financial statements.

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

On 20 February 2018, the Board drew up a report on corporate governance in accordance with article L. 225-37 of the
French Commercial Code. The information is mainly contained in chapters 4 and 5 of this Registration Document and is
listed in detail in the Table of Cross-References annexed to it and covers the following matters:

the list of offices and appointments in any company held by all corporate officers during the past financial year;

regulated agreements and commitments;

current authorisations agreed by the shareholders in general meeting in relation to increases in capital and the use made
of them during the past financial year;

the choice between the two governance structures, in the case of first report or subsequent amendment;

the composition of the Board and the terms applicable to the preparation and organisation of its work;

the principles and rules established by the Remuneration Committee and the Board to determine the remuneration and
benefits of any kind granted to corporate officers;

the limitations, if any, on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer;

the corporate governance code which GET SE has applied; and

the specific arrangements relating to the participation of shareholders in general meetings.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer instructed the Company Secretary to compile the preliminary content of the
corporate governance report, which was prepared by including contributions from several departments, including the
Finance Department, the Financial Control Department, the Internal Audit Department, Internal Control and the Legal
Department. The report was presented to the Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee, the Corporate Committee
and the statutory auditors, and submitted to general management which considers it to be consistent with the systems in
place within the Group. The Board approved it on 20 February 2018.

The corporate governance code to which GET SE refers is the code for listed companies established by the Association
Française des Entreprises Privées (AFEP) and the Mouvement des Entreprises de France (MEDEF) (hereafter referred to
as the Afep/Medef Code).

**4.1** **GENERAL MANAGEMENT**

**_4.1.1 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS_**

The general management of GET SE is carried out by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, without any change in the
governance structure, with an organisation including a Board in which the roles of chairman and chief executive officer
are not separated.

The Group governance structure is adapted to the specific needs of the organisation and is engaged in a continual bid to
support the overall development vision of the business:

to ensure the viability of the business in the first phase of Groupe Eurotunnel SE’s history and

then to prioritise more effective and responsive management in order to promote the company’s development strategy
while ensuring the preservation of the infrastructure and complying with the rules of good governance to which the Group
has always adhered.

Combined roles, which promote an active dialogue between management and the Board, have been retained in the interests
of more efficient and responsive management, linked to the specific history of the business and in changing regulatory,
competitive and market environments.

The environment within which the Group is evolving may become much more complex as a result of Brexit, as indicated in
chapter 3 of this Registration Document. Brexit may cause shockwaves and it is essential to do everything necessary to
manage it and strengthen the Group’s position. In such a political period, keeping the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
in place ensures continuity in the way that the Group is represented at the highest levels in relationships with governments.
It keeps the constant dialogue that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has with the company’s political partners. In
order to stay responsive and competitive, the challenge lies in being able to adapt quickly and effectively (agility, flexibility
and robustness), steered in a cohesive way.

Within the geopolitical background in which the business operates, the Board wishes to continue to draw on the experience
of Jacques Gounon, which he demonstrated during the migrant crisis in the Calais area, to support the company during the
Brexit transitional period for two years. Following that, the Board is minded to split the roles of chairman and chief executive
officer. The Board considers that during this transitional period it is important to keep the roles of Chairman of the Board and
of Chief Executive Officer combined in order to ensure that the Group is represented at the highest level in its dealings with
third parties and so remains particularly efficient in the light of Jacques Gounon’s experience.

The significant development of the Group for more than ten years is due to the strategy put in place by Jacques Gounon.
From the time of his arrival at the head of the company in February 2005, he has crafted a new business model involving
the creation of a plan to save the Group that has led to a reduction in the debt of almost €5 billion. He has rationalised
operations and maintenance and he has adapted costs and resources. The continued increase in profits is testament to the
Group’s recovery, which allows it to invest in core activities and innovate in high value-added solutions. The Group has
become the leader in its markets, Europorte is the only profitable rail freight operator in France and ElecLink, the future
electricity interconnector between France and the UK, is an important growth stream for GET SE. Today, the growth in its
revenue (up 50% in 10 years), an operating margin above 50% in 2017, good cash flow visibility up to 2086 (when the
Concession ends) and almost €600 million returned by way of dividends to shareholders since 2008 demonstrate the

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

relevance and resilience of the strategy, particularly in specific economic and geopolitical contexts such as the UK’s
departure from the European Union.

The governance structure and the question of splitting the roles are a specific question in the Board self-assessment
questionnaire. In 2017 the current governance model (combined chairman and chief executive officer) was still largely
supported taking into account the prospect of the roles being split at the end of the two-year extension of Jacques Gounon’s
term of office.

This method of governance safeguards the prerogatives of the various corporate bodies and complies with the good
governance rules to which the Group has always adhered. The members of the Board and general management have
created a tradition of transparency and open dialogue. Indeed, by virtue of its binational nature the Group has adhered to
exacting governance standards since it was created. Such standards enable the preservation of the interests of all
shareholders as well as a balance of power within the governance structures:

the size of the Board allows for real debate to take place and for clear and rapid decision-making, particularly as Directors
are committed to their role, are independently minded and bring a wide range of skills to the business. In the 2017 Board
self-assessment, the Directors confirmed their satisfaction as to the quality of discussions, conduct of business by the
Board Chairman, freedom of expression and time reserved for discussion;

the Board is very active (9 meetings in 2017): six Board committees have been set up and each is very active: in 2017,
more than 31 committee meetings took place, representing a total of 40 meetings including full Board meetings;

the majority of Board Directors are independent (91%);

some of the committees, including the Audit Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Remuneration Committee,
are exclusively composed of independent Board Directors;

the Ethics and Governance Committee (comprising the chairmen of various Board committees), which has been merged
with the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee going forward, aims to encourage best governance and
ethical practices in the work of the different committees;

since 2014, Colette Neuville, in her capacity as Senior Independent Director, is responsible for ensuring good
governance takes place within the Board and its committees.

The Board sets the term of office of the Chief Executive Officer, which may not exceed his term of office as Chairman.

The Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of GET SE. The Chief
Executive Officer exercises his powers within the scope of the corporate purpose and subject to the powers expressly
conferred by law on shareholders and on the Board, as well as the limitations imposed by the internal rules described in
section 4.1.2 of this Registration Document.

The Chief Executive Officer represents GET SE in its relations with third parties. GET SE is bound by decisions of the Chief
Executive Officer that do not fall within its corporate purpose, unless it can prove that the third party knew or should have
known in the circumstances, that the decision exceeded such purpose. However, the publication of the company’s by-laws
does not alone constitute such proof. Provisions of the by-laws and decisions of the Board limiting the powers of the Chief
Executive Officer are not binding on third parties.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jacques Gounon, is assisted by a Deputy Chief Executive Officer.

On 1 May 2016, François Gauthey was appointed Deputy Chief Executive Officer. The Deputy Chief Executive Officer
assists the Chief Executive Officer. With regards to third parties, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer represents the company
in the same manner as the Chief Executive Officer and pursuant to article L. 225-56, II sub-paragraph 2 of the French
Commercial Code, he has the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer. The maximum number of Deputy Chief Executive
Officers is three. If the Chief Executive Officer were to cease to exercise or be prevented from exercising his duties, the
deputy chief executive officers, if any, continue to carry out their duties and fulfil their role, unless decided otherwise by the
Board, until a new Chief Executive Officer is appointed.

The supervision and support functions within GET SE’s general management are as follows:

Jacques Gounon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is in charge of relations with the States and investors. He
supervises strategy, communications, security and ethics, public affairs, internal audit and the company secretarial
function.

François Gauthey, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, supervises the operational functions of the Concession and safety
as well as the Finance and Legal Departments.

Michel Boudoussier, Chief Operating Officer supervises major projects and the Business Services and the Group Human
Resources Departments.[11]

Pascal Sainson, Europorte Chief Operating Officer.

Philippe de Lagune, Chief Security Officer.

Steven Moore is in charge of the ElecLink project.

The by-laws provide that no person may be appointed as Chief Executive Officer or Deputy Chief Executive Officer if they
are aged over 65 years old. On reaching the age of 65, any Chief Executive Officer or Deputy Chief Executive Officer in
office is deemed to have resigned. In the interests of having the best organisational arrangements in the current geopolitical

_11_ _On 12 March 2018, Michel Boudoussier was appointed Group Chief Corporate Officer and Laurent Fourtune joined the Group as_
_Eurotunnel Chief Operating Officer._


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

situation, the Board has decided to increase the age limit in the by-laws from 65 to 68 years. This will be proposed at the
2018 General Meeting.

The Board can terminate the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer at any time. The Board can also terminate the
appointment of the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.

**_4.1.2 LIMITATIONS ON THE POWERS OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER_**

Neither the provisions of the by-laws of the company nor any decisions of the Board limiting the powers of the Chief Executive
Officer can be enforced against third parties.

Pursuant to article 1 of the internal rules of the Board, major strategic transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of
equity investments and assets, partnership agreements, joint ventures or cooperation agreements relating to research,
development, industrial or commercial matters and more generally any transaction or undertaking that could have a
significant impact on the financial or operating situation of the Group come within the remit of the Board. Article 1 of the
internal rules also states that:

any significant transaction outside the approved business strategy is subject to prior approval by the Board;

these rules apply not only to external acquisition or disposal transactions but also to any significant investments in organic
growth or any major internal restructuring operations.

**_4.1.3 SERVICE CONTRACTS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND GENERAL_**

**_MANAGEMENT AND GET SE_**

GET SE has made no undertakings for the benefit of the executive officers.

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer’s employment contract was suspended on his appointment as an executive officer in
the role of Deputy Chief Executive Officer. The employment contract has been suspended for the period of exercise of his
appointment as Deputy Chief Executive Officer and will be reinstated, in its own right, on the expiry of such duties. The
employment contract will be reinstated at the end of the term of office and the termination of the corporate office does not
involve termination of the employment relationship. Recommendation 21 of the Afep/Medef Code, which is to terminate a
person’s employment contract if they are appointed as a corporate officer, does not concern Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

At the time that Jacques Gounon became the Group’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer he started receiving part of his
remuneration from Eurotunnel Services Limited due to the binational nature of the Concession. By virtue of English law,
which cannot be derogated or waived, such payments technically created a service contract governed by English law. This
was complied with since it is a mandatory provision of English law although the effect was limited to the strict legal minimum.
This contract did not involve any undertaking by the Group for Jacques Gounon’s benefit in terms of a contractual severance
package. However, recommendation 21 of the Afep/Medef Code, which is to terminate a person’s employment contract if
they are appointed as a corporate officer, could not be applied to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, since it was in
contradiction with the mandatory provision of English law referred to above.

In the interests of removing this non-compliance with the Afep/Medef Code, which was disclosed every year in the
Registration Document, the Board decided to put an end to all payments to Jacques Gounon by Eurotunnel Services Limited.

Therefore and with effect from January 2018, the whole of Jacques Gounon’s remuneration is paid to him through Groupe
Eurotunnel SE. In this way the payments that create an English law contract of service have stopped. Since the contract
has no commitment on the part of the company to pay any contractual severance indemnity, it has been brought to an end
without any severance or other payment.

**Evolution of governance: preparation of the terms of office**

The terms of office of six of the 11 directors will come to an end at the close of the General Meeting called on 18 April 2018
to approve the accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. The directors in question are Corinne Bach, Patricia
Hewitt, Jacques Gounon, Bertrand Badré, Philippe Vasseur and Tim Yeo.

The Corporate Committee, in conjunction with the Nominations Committee, has considered the future composition of the
Board of Directors in order to recommend the most appropriate changes. At the end of 2017 and the start of 2018, part of
the work of the Board was dedicated to considering the expiry of the terms of office and how best to smooth them. The
Board took a decision taking into account the contribution of the members of the Board and also how their competences
dovetailed with each other as well as the overall balance of the future composition of the Board.

The environment within which the Group is evolving may become much more complex as a result of Brexit. In the interests
of having the best arrangements to promote Group performance in the current specific geopolitical context, the Board has
sought to create a progressive rotation of board members in a transitional phase so as to avoid compromising the balanced
functioning of the Board by a renewal en masse.

The table below sets out the appointments held by members of the Board of GET SE in French and foreign listed companies

of a board of directors, a management or supervisory board of an issuer or from participating in the management or
conducting the business of an issuer during the past five years.

Tim Yeo was a director of TMO Renewables Limited until 8 February 2017. This company entered administration in the UK
on 19 December 2013 and was placed in liquidation on 8 December 2014.

**_4.2.5 TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE PREPARATION AND ORGANISATION OF THE WORK OF THE BOARD_**

**_OF DIRECTORS_**

**a)** **Composition and organisation of the Board of Directors**

**i.** **Board Directors**

At the date of this Registration Document, the Board of GET SE has 11 Directors, of whom ten are independent (i.e. 91%
of Board Directors in office).

The Board has five female Board Directors, representing more than 45% of the Board, in accordance with the French law
of 27 January 2011 on the balanced representation of women and men on boards of directors.

The proportion of non-French resident Board Directors is 36%.

The Board of Directors is very active: in 2017, there were a total of 40 meetings of the Board and its Committees.

_13 Where transactions carried out by any one of these Directors or executive officers total more than €20,000 in any one calendar year._

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The average age of Board Directors is 68. In order to lower the collective age of the Board while still retaining balance in the
way it functions, and in the interests of having the best arrangements to promote Group performance in the current specific
Brexit geopolitical context, the Board has decided to speed up the renewal of board members and to bring about a speedier
progressive rotation of its members.

The complementary expertise and experience of the Directors is an advantage for the Group. Board members bring to the
company a complementary range of experience and industrial, managerial, financial and scientific skills and a diversity of
backgrounds with a mix of men/women, ages and nationalities.

Board members are appointed, re-appointed or removed by the shareholders’ General Meeting. The Nominations
Committee assesses the composition and size of the Board, oversees the assessment process for candidates for the
position of member of the Board, determines whether such candidates are qualified to become Board Directors, in
accordance with the criteria set out by the Board and makes recommendations to the Board with regards to candidates.

The Board agreed a diversity policy, recognising that a diverse Board encourages more efficient governance and more
enlightened decisions. The composition of the Board aims to balance experience, ability and independence in line with the
equality and diversity which reflect the binational nature of the business. Good synergy within the Board depends on the
diversity (in terms of nationality, competences and so on), equality and complementarity of its members. The Board, as a
whole, must also adequately reflect the communities within which the Group carries on its business (public/private, transport
business, rail infrastructure, cross-Channel market, Franco-British business, a history of crises). In December 2016, the
Board strengthened equality by appointing a new female director, Corinne Bach, and, with regard to the specific expertise
required by the Board, strengthened the specific added value of the Board via her cutting-edge knowledge of new
technologies and digital media challenges.

In 2017, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and against the
background of its review of the composition of the Board, decided to appoint a young director, with recognised expertise
and experience in international private and public financial and ethical matters and so co-opted Bertrand Badré in a move
aimed at speeding up the rotation of the Board.

It is expected that Directors should have the following essential qualities:

to be mindful of the interests of the company;

to be a good judge, in particular of situations, strategies and persons, based amongst other things on their experience;

to be able to anticipate so as to identify risks and strategic issues;

to have integrity, be present, active and involved.

The following qualifications or attributes are taken into account in the selection of Directors: management and/or board
experience, comprehensive and multi-disciplinary experience, integrity and professionalism, and personal qualities required
to contribute actively to the discussions of the Board.

Throughout their term of office, each Director must own 5,000 ordinary shares, to be purchased over a three-year period,
reaching the following minimum number each year:

Year 1: 2,000 ordinary shares,

Year 2: 3,000 ordinary shares,

Year 3: 5,000 ordinary shares.

If any of the Directors do not own the prescribed number of ordinary shares, they are deemed to have resigned unless the
situation is remedied within the appropriate time.


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

If there are one or more vacancies on the Board, the Board may, between two General Meetings, make interim appointments
in accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-24 of the French Commercial Code. The term of office of Directors
appointed as a replacement for another director is the remainder of the term of office of their predecessor. To ensure the
continuity, coherence and quality of the Board’s work, and in accordance with recommendation 12 of the Afep/Medef Code
relating to training of new Directors, GET SE offers new Board members an induction period designed to facilitate their
integration: on-site visits to facilitate an understanding of the company’s business, a briefing on economic/financial data, the
Group’s key constitutional documents and the possibility to attend external training, including with IFA.

As at the date of this Registration Document, the term of office of a Director in the by-laws is four years. The appointment
terminates at the end of the ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements of the preceding financial
year and held during the year in which their term of office expires.

All outgoing members are eligible for re-election. Notwithstanding the above, the number of people aged over 75 years old
serving on the Board as individuals or as permanent representatives of legal entities may not exceed one third (rounded up
to the nearest whole number, if applicable) of the number of Directors serving at the end of each General Meeting called to
approve the parent company’s financial statements. If this limit is exceeded, the oldest Director is automatically deemed to
have resigned.

**ii.** **Chairman of the Board**

The Board appoints one of its members as Chairman for a period identical to their term of office as Director, unless the
Board sets a shorter term. The Chairman must be an individual.

The Chairman of the Board represents the Board. He directs and organises the work of the Board and reports on this to the
General Meeting. He ensures the proper functioning of GET SE’s bodies and, in particular, that members of the Board are
able to perform their duties.

The age limit for the position of Chairman of the Board is 70. The term of office of the Chairman expires on the date of the
ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements of the financial year during which the serving Chairman
reaches the age limit. However, the Board may extend or renew the term of office of the Chairman for additional one-year
periods, up to five times.

Should the Chairman be temporarily unable to carry out his duties or in the event of his death, the Board may appoint a
Director to serve in his place. Where the impediment is temporary, the appointment is for a limited period, which may be
renewed. In the event of the incumbent’s death, the appointment is effective until a new Chairman is appointed.

**iii.** **Meetings of the Board**

The Board meets as frequently as the interests of the company require and at least three times each year. Meetings are
called by the Chairman or by the Director designated to act in the Chairman’s place and are held at the registered office or
at any other place specified by the person who calls the meeting. However, if the Board has not met for more than two
months, Directors representing at least one third of the members of the Board and, if applicable, the Chief Executive Officer,
may request that the Chairman call a meeting on a specific agenda.

Meetings of the Board are conducted in French with an unofficial translation in English. Documents provided to members
for meetings of the Board, as well as minutes of the meeting, are prepared in French with an unofficial translation in English.

**iv.** **Quorum**

The presence of at least one half of the serving members is required for a meeting of the Board to proceed to business. The
internal rules of the Board provide that members are deemed to be present within the scope of article L. 225-37 of the French
Commercial Code, for the purpose of calculating the quorum and majority, when they participate by videoconference or
other means of telecommunication that enable them to be identified and to participate in the meeting in accordance with
governing laws and regulations. This provision does not apply for the approval of decisions referred to in articles L. 232-1
and L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code.

**v.** **Majority**

Decisions are taken by a majority of members present or represented, with the Chairman casting the deciding vote in the
event of a tied vote.

**vi.** **Powers**

The Board determines GET SE’s business objectives and oversees their implementation. Subject to the powers expressly
granted to shareholders in General Meetings and within the limits of the corporate purpose, the Board may consider any
matter affecting the proper functioning of GET SE and takes decisions in this respect in the interest of all shareholders.

In its relations with third parties, GET SE is bound by decisions of the Board that do not fall within its corporate purpose,
unless it can prove that the third party knew or should have known in the circumstances that the decision exceeded the
corporate purpose. However, the publication of the by- laws does not alone constitute such proof.

The Board may carry out such controls and checks as it deems appropriate. Each Director receives all information and
documents needed to perform their duties in accordance with the conditions set out in the internal rules of the Board,
particularly as regards confidentiality.

The Board may decide to establish committees for the purpose of considering issues that the Board or its Chairman may
submit for their review. The Board determines the composition and terms of reference of the said committees, which conduct
their business under the responsibility of the Board. The Board also determines the remuneration of the committee members,
if any.

The Board decides or authorises the issue of debt securities pursuant to article L. 228-40 of the French Commercial Code,
unless the General Meeting resolves to exercise this power.

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

**vii.** **Board members’ rights, information and ethics (ethics charter, internal rules, code of conduct)**

Since the beginning, the Group has developed on strong values that ensure cohesion, its future and its development. The
Board is committed to promoting those values, as well as the best governance and ethical practices, within the Group.

**Governance**

The Ethics and Governance Committee of the Board (which became the Corporate Committee in December 2017) ensures
that the ethical culture and principles applicable to management and the entire staff are communicated within the business.
The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer supports the ethics and compliance policy with, in particular, a strong
zero-tolerance message in the fight against corruption. The implementation of this approach is led by the Compliance Officer,
who steers the ethics action plans and leads an internal working group (Compliance Steering Group). This committee brings
the Internal Control, Internal Audit, Legal, Human Resources and Public Affairs Departments together to oversee compliance
with the rules set out in the ethics policy and the procedures contained in it, under the sponsorship of the Group’s Compliance
Officer and with the responsibilities being allocated to the relevant departments. The compliance convergences and links
are contained in a matrix of compliance topics with owners allocated to each topic. The Legal Department is thus the owner
of the topics relating to personal data. The Board secretariat monitors market laws and regulations, as well as best practice
with regard to corporate governance, and ensures they are transposed into internal rules and procedures.

**Group Ethics Charter**

The Group has established a Group Ethics Charter which extends the ethics policy already in place within the Concession
to all entities which have joined the Group. In accordance with the United Nations Global Compact, the Group Ethics Charter
describes the fundamental values which must guide every employee, whatever the circumstances or the country, by
reference to the OECD guidelines for companies as indicated in chapter 6 of this Registration Document. This Charter
includes an internal whistleblowing system.

As an extension of this Charter, the Board of Directors has drawn up a policy for the fight against corruption, supported by
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s zero tolerance message and which defines and illustrates the different types of
unacceptable behaviour. A tailored training system seeks to ensure the effectiveness of this policy. This Charter contains a
whistleblowing procedure and has been supplemented by implementation guidelines.

**The Directors’ Charter**

The Directors’ Charter sets out the rights and obligations of each Director, in particular with regards to conflicts of interests.
Each Director undertakes to abide by this charter and carry out their duties with independence, integrity, loyalty and
professionalism. As indicated below, the Senior Independent Director ensures that the Board and its committees abide by
governance practices and is responsible for handling any conflict of interests of executive corporate officers and other
Directors: “Directors undertake, in all circumstances, to maintain their independence of analysis, judgement, decision and
_action and to reject any direct or indirect pressure on them from other Directors, groups of shareholders, creditors, suppliers,_
_and more generally, any third party. In particular, Directors must avoid plurality of functions within companies, which directly_
_or indirectly compete with the company, such plurality being likely to affect the interest of the company, or its governance._
_Directors undertake not to seek or accept from the company or the subsidiaries thereof, directly or indirectly, any advantages_
_likely to affect their independence.”_

Conflicts of interest within the Board are managed as follows:

all Directors are under the obligation to inform the Board of any circumstances – even potential – of a conflict of interest
between themselves (or any individual or legal entity with which they have a business relationship) and Groupe
Eurotunnel SE or any of the companies in which Groupe Eurotunnel SE has an interest, or any company with which
Groupe Eurotunnel SE intends to enter into an agreement of any nature whatsoever;

if a Director is unsure about the existence of a conflict of interest – even potential – he or she must immediately inform
the Chairman of the Board who will have the responsibility of deciding whether or not the Board must be informed, and
thereupon initiate the procedure for managing conflicts of interest;

if the member of the Board referred to in the previous subparagraph is in fact the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman
must inform the Senior Independent Director of the Board, or failing that, the Board itself;

the relevant Director must refrain from voting in the Board’s decision regarding the conclusion of the agreement in
question and from participating in the discussion preceding that vote; and

additionally, the Chairman of the Board, the members of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and, as the case may
be, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s) are under no obligation to communicate information or documents relating to
the agreement or the transaction from which the conflict of interest arose to the member or members of the Board when
they have reasonable grounds to believe that the member or members have a conflict of interest; they must inform the
Board of the information or documents being withheld.

**Securities Ethics Charter**

The Board drew up a code of conduct governing transactions in securities so as to avoid any insider trading issues. This
code was updated following the entry into effect of EU Regulation 596/2014 of 16 April 2014 on market abuse and the AMF
guidance of 26 October 2016 on permanent reporting and the management of inside information. The first part of the code,
which is now called the Securities Ethics Charter, sets out the essential ethical principles that apply and the second part
sets out the applicable preventive measures, with specific preventive measures for financial transactions. The appendix to
the code contains a description of the legal and regulatory provisions applicable, together with details of potential sanctions.
This code sets out the blackout periods for securities transactions and the exercise of options. This recommendation covers
all types of exercises of options including simple exercises, i.e. options exercised without an ensuing sale. The code defines
the following blackout periods:


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

a minimum of 30 calendar days prior to the publishing of the annual and half-yearly financial statements; and

a minimum of 15 calendar days prior to the publishing of the quarterly disclosures.

**Internal rules**

The Board has approved a set of internal rules to complement the laws, regulations and by-laws, specifying the role and
functional practices of the Board and its committees, with particular attention given to the principles of the Afep/Medef Code.
The internal rules are updated on a regular basis and most recently on 30 January 2018.

The internal rules include specific provision concerning the composition of the Board and the independence criteria applied
to its members, the duties and powers of the Board, information provided to members and the internal rules of each of
its committees.

The main provisions of these internal rules are described below.

**Role of the Board**

As part of its management responsibilities, and in compliance with governing laws and the by-laws of GET SE, the Board:

appoints or removes the executive officers and decides whether the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles should
be combined or separate;

defines strategy guidelines for GET SE and the Group, together with its proposed investments, divestments and internal
reorganisations, the Group’s overall human resources policy, in particular its remuneration, profit-sharing and staff
incentive policy; carries out an annual appraisal of the performance of general management;

approves regulated agreements;

considers major strategic transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of equity investments and assets, partnership
agreements, joint ventures or cooperation agreements relating to research, development, industrial or commercial
matters and more generally any transaction or undertaking that could have a significant impact on the financial or
operating situation of the Group; any significant transaction outside the approved business strategy is subject to prior
approval by the Board; this rule applies to external acquisitions and disposals, as well as major investments in organic
growth or internal restructuring;

is kept informed by its Chairman and its committees of all significant events affecting the business, financial situation
and cash flow of GET SE and the Group and of the company’s commitments. It is informed in a timely manner of the
company’s liquidity positions so that it can take, where necessary, decisions regarding its financing and its debt;

sets the annual performance objectives of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the Deputy Chief Executive
Officer and their remuneration in accordance with the principles defined in the Afep/Medef Code, as amended, and
submits this remuneration to the General Meeting for vote in accordance with the conditions required by law and the
recommendations of the Afep/Medef Code, as amended;

takes note of the essential characteristics of the internal control and risk management systems adopted and implemented
by the general management. Specifically, the Board checks with the general management that the coordination
procedure and internal control and risk management systems are able to guarantee the reliability of the company’s
financial disclosures and give a true and fair view of the results and financial position of the company and the Group;

ensures that strategies and objectives are in place for the known major risks facing the company, and that these major
risks are taken into account in the company’s management; and

ensures that proper information is provided to shareholders and the public, particularly through the control that it
exercises over information provided by the company; in this capacity, it defines the communication policy of GET SE
concerning the frequency of publication of financial information relating to the Group.

The internal rules state that shareholders should be consulted when the sale of assets representing one half or more of the
company’s assets over the last two financial years is considered. This threshold is considered to have been attained when
two ratios reach or exceed half of the consolidated amount (calculated for the divesting company over the previous two
financial years). Ratios include:

revenue realised by the assets or operations sold to total consolidated revenue;

the sale price of the asset(s) sold to the stock market capitalisation of the Group;

the net carrying amount of the asset(s) sold to the total consolidated balance sheet;

the pre-tax net income from ordinary activities generated by the assets or operations sold to consolidated pre-tax net
income from ordinary activities; and

the number of employees of operations sold compared to the total Group workforce.

**Members of the Board**

Irrespective of their specific position or competences, each Director must act in the best interest of the company.

Each Board Director must devote the time and attention necessary to fulfil their duties and participate in meetings of the
Board and of the committees of which they are a member.

The Board must be composed of members chosen for their skill and experience relevant to the business of the Group.

Members of the Board may attend training sessions on the specific character of the business, its activities or its business
sector, such training being organised by GET SE on its own initiative or at the request of the Board.


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Each Director is required to notify the AMF and GET SE of any acquisition, disposal, subscription or exchange of financial
instruments issued by GET SE or any transaction in related financial instruments, in accordance with applicable
regulations.

The duties of Directors are as described in the Afep/Medef Code. Before accepting the position, Directors must ensure
that they are aware of the general obligations of Board members and of those specific to their role. Directors must be
aware of all relevant provisions of the governing law, the by-laws of GET SE and the internal rules of the Board that
apply to them.

Each Director has the obligation to disclose to the Board any actual or potential conflict of interest between them and
GET SE or the Group and must abstain from voting on matters considered at meetings of the Board to which the conflict
of interest relates, unless the conflict of interest arises in connection with an agreement entered into in the ordinary
course of business under normal conditions.

The number of additional appointments held by members of the Board in listed companies outside the Group is limited
to two additional appointments in listed companies outside the Group for chief executive officers and to four additional
appointments in listed companies outside the Group for other Directors. This includes any appointments held in foreign
listed companies. Board members must inform the Board of any new appointment. The limit is assessed on each
appointment or re-appointment. The internal rules have been reviewed in order to specify that, in accordance with
recommendation 18.2 of the Afep/Medef code, the executive officers must receive prior advice from the Board before
accepting another appointment in a listed company; this provision has not yet been drawn on by the company.

Board members must all contribute towards determining the business strategy of the Group and overseeing the
implementation of such strategy. They must supervise the management of the Group appropriately.

All materials provided at meetings of the Board and all information obtained during or outside such meetings of the Board
are strictly confidential without exception, irrespective of whether such materials or information were presented as
confidential. Board members must consider themselves bound to secrecy beyond a mere obligation of discretion.

In addition to this obligation of confidentiality, Directors undertake not to make public statements in their capacity as
members of the Board on any matter pertaining to the Group, whether or not related to meetings of the Board, without
the prior consent of the Chairman.

Every Board Director must comply with all market regulations intended to prevent market abuse that would be harmful
to the interests and image of the Group.

**Board proceedings, videoconferencing or teleconferencing**

The internal rules of the Board state that Directors may participate in meetings by all means authorised by law and the
by-laws, including videoconferencing or teleconferencing as long as such videoconferencing or teleconferencing facilities
(i) enable the transmission of at least the voices of the participants and (ii) satisfy technical requirements enabling the
continuous and simultaneous transmission of the proceedings.

**Information for Board members**

The Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer gives each Director the documents and information needed to carry out their
duties, subject to the confidentiality obligations described in the internal rules.

**Committees**

The Board may establish temporary or permanent special committees, each consisting of at least three and no more than
six members appointed by the Board, with one committee member designated by the Board as the committee chairman.

The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nominations Committee, a Remuneration Committee, a Safety and
Security Committee, a Corporate Committee (as the merged Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee and Ethics
and Governance Committee is known) and an Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee, as described in section c) of
this chapter.

**Independent Directors**

At least half of the Directors must be independent within the scope of and in accordance with the criteria set out in
recommendation 8.5 of the Afep/Medef Code.

The criteria for Directors to be viewed as independent are the following:

not to be and not to have been during the course of the previous five years:

   - an employee or chief executive officer of GET SE;

   - an employee, chief executive officer of a company or a director of a company consolidated within GET SE;

   - an employee, chief executive officer or a director of the company’s parent company or a company consolidated within
this parent;

not to be or have been during the previous five years an executive corporate officer of a company in which GET SE
holds, either directly or indirectly, a directorship or in which an employee appointed as such or an executive corporate
officer of GET SE (currently in office or having held such office for less than five years) is a director;

not to be a customer, supplier, investment banker or commercial banker:

   - that is material to GET SE or the Group,

   - or for whom GET SE or the Group represent a significant part of their business.


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The evaluation of how significant the relationship is with GET SE or the Group must be debated by the Board. The Board
of directors assesses the significance of the business relationship with the company. The significance or not of a business
relationship is not only considered in terms of quantitative criteria. The Board also considers other parameters when
determining whether such a relationship is material and free of major conflict.

not to be related by close family ties to an executive corporate officer;

not to have been an auditor of the company within the previous five years;

not to have been a Director of GET SE for more than 12 years.

Board members representing substantial shareholders of the company may be considered independent so long as such
shareholders do not participate in the control of the company. However, where the interest of the shareholder in question
exceeds 10% of the share capital or voting rights, the Board must consider the matter of the Director’s independence, on
the basis of a report from the Nominations Committee, taking into account the structure of the capital of the company and
the existence of potential conflicts of interest.

**Board members who satisfy the independence criteria**

The Board is required to verify at least once a year that Directors satisfy the independence criteria set out above.

After consideration of their individual position by the Nominations Committee, the Board resolved on 20 February 2018 that
the following Directors met the independence criteria set out in the Afep/Medef Code: Colette Neuville, Patricia Hewitt,
Perrette Rey, Peter Levene, Colette Lewiner, Corinne Bach, Bertrand Badré, Philippe Vasseur, Tim Yeo as well as
Jean-Pierre Trotignon.

Jacques Gounon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is not considered to be an independent Director.

The Board, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, has confirmed that there are no significant business
relationships between Group companies, and other companies outside the Group in which independent Board members of
Groupe Eurotunnel SE are also appointed as a director.

The Board considered a multi-criteria analysis carried out by the Nominations Committee. The Board referred to a table
summarising fund flows (purchases and sales) during the last financial year, between:

Group companies, and

Group companies of which independent Directors of the company are also a board member.

These fund flows are considered in relation to the total weight of purchases and sales, for each group, to measure their
significance. For 2017, this table shows that the sum of sales of the company’s Group, to any one of the groups concerned,
or of its purchases from any one of those groups, does not exceed 0.2% of the total sales or purchases of the company’s
Group or of any one of the groups concerned, with the exception of two suppliers EDF and Colas of which Colette Lewiner
is a director.

Firstly, the Board noted and confirmed the practice of initiating calls for tender. The Board carried out a qualitative analysis
of the parameters used to determine whether or not such a relationship is material and if it is exempt from conflicts of interest,
including but not limited to:

the period and continuity (precedence, history, renewals);

the importance or the “intensity” of the relationship (possible economic dependency; exclusive relations or predominance
in the sector in which the business relationship is established; distribution of bargaining power, etc.);

the organisation of the relationship: Colette Lewiner is not a member of the Board of the contracting companies (France
Manche SA, The Channel Tunnel Group Limited, Europorte) and holds no direct deciding power over the contracts and
agreements constituting the business relationship; Colette Lewiner has received no compensation associated with the
contract, link or business relationship that may exist with EDF and Colas.

Thus, the Board, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, confirmed the absence of any significant business
relationship in 2017.

Therefore, as at 20 February 2018, 10 of the 11 Board Directors are independent (i.e. 91% of the Directors in office). More
than half of the Directors are independent in accordance with the recommendations of the Afep/Medef Code.

**Senior Independent Director**

The Board has appointed Colette Neuville as the Senior Independent Director of GET SE. In accordance with the internal
rules of the Board, this Director must be independent as defined by the Afep/Medef Code. The Senior Independent Director
is appointed for the duration of his/her term of office as Director.

The Senior Independent Director has the following duties:

monitor and manage any potential conflict of interest situations that may arise for the executive corporate officers and
other Directors;

suggest additional agenda items to the Chairman for meetings of the Board, as required;

ensure that the Board and committees adopt good governance;

manage the annual assessment of the Board on the basis of an anonymous detailed questionnaire on the roles and
competence of the Board, its functioning as a whole and the areas dealt with by the Board and its committees.

In order to preserve his/her independence, the Senior Independent Director is not remunerated for this role. In 2017, the
Senior Independent Director established the practice of having meetings without the executive officers present (“executive
sessions”).

**Employee representative Director**

In accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-27 of the French Commercial Code, Groupe Eurotunnel SE will put a
proposal to a shareholder vote on 18 April 2018 that the by-laws be amended to approve the formalities for the appointment
of the requisite number of employee representative director(s) as required by law. The appointment will be made in the six
months following approval of the amendment of the by-laws. The employee representative Director has the same status,
rights and responsibilities as the other Directors.

The significant number of meetings and high attendance rate of Directors throughout the year should be noted. This
frequency of meetings and attendance rate are the first objective factor which once again offer assurance that the Board is
in a position to fulfil its role and take appropriate decisions.

**Recurring topics**

In 2017, in addition to financial and legal authorisations, the Board concentrated mainly on issues of strategy, the accounts
and corporate and business governance.

At each of its meetings, the Board discussed business development and performance in terms of the Group’s activities and
results. It took note of the company’s stock market performance and its market capitalisation and data trends concerning
intrusion attempts.

During the 2017 financial year, the Board finalised the financial statements as at 31 December 2016 and prepared the
half-year financial statements for the six-months ended 30 June 2017. In these presentations as well as in the monthly report
to the Board, the Board was kept informed of the financial situation and the cash situation. The presentation of the financial
department also covered risks and material off-balance sheet commitments and the statutory auditors’ presentation
highlighted the key points arising from the statutory audit and the accounting options adopted.

The Board also considered the five-year plan and the budget for 2018 for all activities. The Board also carried out a review
of the risk map for the Group, as well as the activity of the internal audit function. It considered the level of risk that the
company is willing to accept in a given area in order to attain its objectives.

The Board also made preparations for the combined 2017 General Meeting and, in particular, drew up the draft resolutions.
The Board decided to renew the share buyback programme.

Regarding corporate governance, during 2017 the Board approved the update to the internal rules. It carried out a
self-assessment and approved the Chairman’s report on internal control procedures for 2016. The Board determined the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s variable remuneration for 2016, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and
Nominations Committee, and set the targets that would determine the variable portion of the remuneration of the Chairman
and Chief Executive’s Officer and of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for 2017. When assessing the performance of the
executive corporate officers, the external Board members meet without the internal Board members being present.

The Senior Independent Director also established a practice of holding Board meetings without executive officers or internal
executives present (executive sessions). In addition, Groupe Eurotunnel SE opted for an electronic management solution
for Board documents and the dematerialisation of meetings, which provides directors with access to discussion tools,
collaborative documents and the possibility to share their comments, thereby optimising collaboration between directors in
the absence of internal directors.

The Board was informed throughout the year of developments in the migrant crisis and measures taken to strengthen site
security.

During the annual strategy seminar, Board members undertook a detailed strategic analysis of the Group in its competitive
environment. It debated and heard presentations on the Group’s financial, strategic, employee and regulatory position and
the results of actions taken. The major issues and opportunities concerning the various segments were presented and
debated. The Board examined and decided the Group’s strategic direction with respect to the different potential strategic
transactions impacting its scope.

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

**Specific topics**

During 2017, the Board monitored progress in the ElecLink interconnector project.

Since the referendum vote on 23 June 2016, the Board has monitored the specific review of risks relating to the exit by the
United Kingdom from the European Union.

The Board oversaw the implementation of the partial refinancing of the debt on the C Tranches of the Term Loan on 6 June
2017. The Board also monitored progress of the Group’s project to acquire the G2 bonds, including the implementation of
the commitment conditions and the completion of the operation.

The Board also discussed its composition, following a proposal of the Nominations Committee, in the interests of having the
best arrangements to promote Group performance in the current specific geopolitical context, the Board has sought to create
a progressive rotation of board members in a transitional phase so as to speed up the renewal of board members while
avoiding renewal en masse. It will also propose to the General Meeting that the by-laws be amended to increase the age
limit of the Chief Executive Officer to 68. The Board prepared the amendment of the by-laws to enable the requisite number
of employee representative Directors to be appointed. The Board approved the Group’s proposed anti-corruption policy.

**The Board met twice between the beginning of this year and 20 February 2018, the date on which the Board finalised**
the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. The average attendance rate was 100%. These meetings
focused on the risk review, on finalising the consolidated and parent company financial statements as at 31 December 2017,
on consideration of the management report and the governance report both prepared pursuant to the provisions of
article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial Code, on the Board’s reports to the General Meeting and on the self-assessment
of the Board, as well as on determining of the variable annual remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for the 2017 financial year, the remuneration policy and the 2018 remuneration
criteria. The Board considered the information to be given to shareholders in this Registration Document, so that
shareholders are fully able to evaluate the company’s management, its Board and its strategy.

**c)** **Committees of the Board of Directors**

The Board delegates to the special committees the task of preparing and submitting information on specific topics for the
Board’s approval. Six committees investigate matters that fall within their field of responsibility, and submit their opinions
and recommendations to the Board namely: the Audit Committee; the Nominations Committee; the Remuneration
Committee; the Safety and Security Committee; the Corporate Committee and the Economic Regulations Monitoring
Committee, all of whose terms of reference are governed by the internal rules of the Board and its committees. Each
committee has a chairperson. At the end of 2017, the Board of Directors decided to split the Nomination and Remuneration
Committee into two committees. It also decided to merge the Ethics and Governance Committee with the Strategy and
Sustainable Development Committee to form a single Corporate Committee. The provisional Energy Committee, created at
the end of 2016, was dissolved and the Board created an Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee.

**Audit Committee**

_Composition and duties set out in the internal rules_

The Audit Committee is composed of at least three members chosen from among the Directors other than the Chairman of
the Board, including at least two independent Directors in accordance with recommendation 15.1 of the Afep/Medef Code.
The Board appoints one of the members as chairman of the Audit Committee. At least one member of the Audit Committee
must have “specific expertise in finance or accounting matters” and be “independent” and the other members of the Audit
Committee must have a minimum of expertise in financial and accounting matters if they are not experts in the matter.

The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year when meetings are called by its chair.


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The duties of the Audit Committee are to:

Monitor the process of preparation of the financial and accounting information; before presentation to the Board, the
Audit Committee examines the consolidated and parent company financial statements, together with budgets and
forecasts; it reviews the accounting and financial information, particularly the financial statements, checking that
important events or complex transactions have been properly accounted for.

The Audit Committee is informed of the architecture of all systems for establishing accounting and financial information;
when financial information is taken from an accounting process, it must be coherent with the accounting information that
is produced; if it is not taken from an accounting process, the Audit Committee must make sure that the information
comes from a process that is sufficiently structured and organised to be able to judge the quality and reliability of this
information (non-standardised performance measures, restructuring plan, etc.).

Ensure the statutory audit of the financial statements by the statutory auditors. The Audit Committee holds discussions
with the statutory auditors and examines their conclusions, to learn the main areas of risk or uncertainty concerning the
annual or consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee examines the main factors having an impact on the
audit approach (scope of consolidation, acquisition and disposal transactions, accounting options, new standards
applied, large transactions, etc.) and significant risks relating to the preparation and processing of the financial and
accounting information identified by the statutory auditors.

Monitor the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems: the Audit Committee checks the existence
of internal control and risk management systems, and that they are made use of, and makes sure that the weaknesses
identified are dealt with by corrective action. When monitoring the efficiency of the internal control and risk management
systems and, where appropriate, internal audit, with respect to the procedures relating to the preparation and processing
of accounting and financial information, the Committee meets with the internal audit and risk control managers and
issues an opinion on their departments. It is informed of the internal audit program and receives the internal audit reports
or a periodic summary of these reports.

The Committee examines material risks and off-balance sheet commitments, assesses the importance of failures or
weaknesses communicated to it and informs the Board, where appropriate.

Ensure that the independence of the statutory auditors is monitored: the Committee is in charge of steering the selection
and re-appointment of the statutory auditors, where appropriate using a call-for-tenders procedure, issuing an opinion
on the amount of fees requested by them, and issuing a recommendation on the statutory auditors proposed for
appointment by the General Meeting.

_Composition, duties and proceedings in 2017_

At 20 February 2018, the Audit Committee is composed of Colette Lewiner (Chairwoman), Colette Neuville and Perrette
Rey. 100% of the Committee members are female and all members of the Committee are independent Board Directors.
GET SE complies with the recommendation of the Afep/Medef Code relating to the presence of two thirds of independent
Board Directors.

The three members of the Committee have specific financial and accounting skills with regard to their academic background,
experience and specific knowledge relevant to the Committee’s work: the Chair of the Committee, Colette Lewiner (member
of EDF, Colas SA and Ingénico’s audit committees, former chairwoman of the board of directors and chief executive of SGN,
former chairwoman of the board of directors of TDF, graduate of the École Normale Supérieure, and holder of a degree and
a doctorate in physics); Perrette Rey (former member of the French state shareholding commission, in charge of finance at
Banques Populaires, chairwoman of the French observatory for businesses in difficulty set up by the chamber of commerce
and industry, chairwoman of the Paris Commercial Court and graduate of IEP, IAE, DES Economic Management and doctor
of business law); and Colette Neuville (experience acquired as chairwoman of the ADAM, graduate of IEP, DES economics
and law degree).

Their training and professional experience covers a broad and comprehensive range of fields, as confirmed by their
professional careers presented in section 4.2.1 of this Registration Document.

The Audit Committee met seven times in 2017 with an average attendance rate of 100%.

_Audit Committee meeting attendance in 2017_

**Committee meetings** **Number of meetings** **Attendance**

Colette Lewiner 7 7 100%

Colette Neuville 7 7 100%

Perrette Rey 7 7 100%

During the accounts closing preparation process, the Audit Committee meets with the statutory auditors and the
presentations of the accounts by the Finance Department. More detailed presentations are given by other managers or
external consultants on certain subjects, including internal control and risk management.

During 2017, the Audit Committee examined the parent company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2016 and the proposed interim financial statements before they were presented to the Board, and expressed
its opinion on these proposed financial statements to the Board. As part of this work, the Audit Committee examined the
accounting treatment of material transactions during the period, accounting methods, the accounting treatment of
discontinued operations, the scope of consolidation and the main items of financial reporting relating to the financial
statements. It also examined material off-balance sheet commitments. It meets with the internal audit director and

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

considered the internal audit plan for 2018 and the presentation of the activities carried out by internal audit in the first half
of 2017.

The Audit Committee reviewed in 2017 the procedures for identifying, monitoring and managing risks and internal audit,
reviewed the risks and analysed the risk map, and examined significant financial and operational risks. It reported to the
Board on its work. Since the UK Brexit referendum, the Audit Committee has regularly reviewed the specific risks associated
with Brexit, encompassing regulatory, taxation and financial risks as well as the macro-economic risks to which the
company’s businesses are exposed. This review was repeated and last updated for the last time in January 2018. The
Committee reviewed the regulated agreements.

The Internal Audit Director reported to the Committee on the activity of the Internal Audit Department in the second half of
2017. The Audit Committee reviewed the internal audit plan for 2018. It also reviewed the Audit Committee Charter and
renewed for a year the transactions pre-authorised under that Charter.

The Audit Committee worked on the implementation of the partial debt refinancing of the Term Loan C Tranches and the
Group’s project to acquire the G2 bonds.

The Audit Committee met three times between the beginning of this year and 20 February 2018. The attendance rate of its
members was 100%. These meetings focused on the proposed consolidated and parent company financial statements at
31 December 2017, the accounting treatment of material transactions during the period and the accounting methods. The
Audit Committee’s meeting to examine the accounts in advance of the Board’s examination of the accounts took place on
13 February 2018, seven days before the Board meeting. The Committee monitored the independence of the statutory
auditors.

**Nomination and Remuneration Committee**

_Composition and duties set out in the internal rules_

On 18 December 2017, the Nominations Committee separated from the Remuneration Committee.

Until 18 December 2017, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee was composed of three members chosen from
among the Directors other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, including at least two independent Directors.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is not a member of this Committee. When his attendance is needed, he may join
in the work of the Committee, in accordance with recommendation 16.3 of the Afep/Medef Code, on specific matters, such
as appointments or presentation of the remuneration policy for key senior managers who are not corporate officers.

Members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee must not:

have any personal financial interests in the decisions of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, other than those
of a Director and a member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee; and

have any reciprocal relationship with an executive Director of GET SE that could suggest that they reached an agreement
to increase their respective remuneration.

The Committee made recommendations to the Board with regard to the selection of new Directors, assessed the size and
composition of the Board and identified the persons with the appropriate qualities to join the Board, in accordance with the
admission criteria for Directors prescribed by the Board, a summary of which appears in section 4.2.5. The Nomination and
Remuneration Committee oversees the assessment process for candidates to the position of Director.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee may also propose the appointment or removal of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officers and the Chief Operating Officers, and the appointment of their
successors.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee was able to request external technical research.

_Composition, duties and proceedings in 2017_

Until 18 December 2017, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee was composed of Colette Neuville (Chairwoman),
Philippe Vasseur and Perrette Rey. In the interests of strengthening the role of independent Directors, all members of the
Committee are independent Board Directors and the Committee is chaired by an independent Board member.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee met seven times in 2017. The average attendance rate of members per
meeting was 100%.

_Nomination and Remuneration Committee meeting attendance in 2017_

**Committee meetings** **Number of meetings** **Attendance**

Colette Neuville 7 7 100%

Perrette Rey 7 7 100%

Philippe Vasseur 7 7 100%

During these meetings, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee prepared the remuneration of executive officers
before approval by the Board. It reviewed the financial and operational objective criteria for determining the variable
remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy CEO as proposed to the Board. The Nomination
and Remuneration Committee was assisted by an external consultant and the Committee steered the benchmarking studies
performed by that advisor. The Committee met the Group’s Human Resources Director who presented the Group’s salary
policy and the executive officer remuneration policy.


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Committee worked on a system to link the remuneration of employees and of management to the business’s
performance, adopted by the General Meeting of 27 April 2017, including a collective free share award plan for all Group
employees and the grant of free performance shares to senior managers and executive officers.

The Committee examined the Board’s proposed report to the General Meeting on the remuneration of executive corporate
officers.

The Committee also reviewed the independence of Board Directors. The Committee prepared the proposals presented for
consideration and approval by the Board. The Committee participated in every step of the appointment process for a new
Director. The Committee convened to choose the selection criteria, meet the candidates and organise the introduction of
the potential candidate to the Board of Directors. The Committee considered the implementation of the Rebsamen law of 17
August 2015 relating to social dialogue and employment in order to provide for the appointment an employee representative
with voting rights on the Board of Directors.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee, as part of normal succession planning work, has proposed that the age limit
of the Chief Executive Officer be increased in the by-laws and that Jacques Gounon’s term of office be extended. It informed
the Board of its work in those areas.

On 18 December 2017, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee was split into two separate committees:

the Nominations Committee, chaired by Perrette Rey and including Perrette Rey, Colette Neuville, Jean-Pierre Trotignon
and Philippe Vasseur; and

the Remuneration Committee, chaired by Colette Neuville and including Colette Neuville, Perrette Rey and Philippe
Vasseur.

**The Remuneration Committee met twice** **between the start of this year and 20 February 2018. The attendance rate of**
its members was 100%. These meetings focused on the report on the principles and rules used to determine the
remuneration and benefits of any kind granted to the executive officers, the determination of the amount of variable
remuneration for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for 2017, and set the
criteria for determining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s and Deputy Chief Executive Officer’s variable
remuneration for 2018. The Committee worked on a plan to align the interests of employees and executives with the
performance of the business, including the grant of free ordinary shares to all employees of GET SE and its subsidiaries,
(with the exception of executive officers) and the grant to senior management and executives of preference shares
convertible into ordinary shares.

The Committee examined the proposed report of the Board to the General Meeting on the remuneration of chief executive
officers (ex ante) and the remuneration paid or payable in respect of 2017 (ex post), as contained in chapter 5 of this
Registration Document.

**The Nominations Committee met once between the beginning of this year and 20 February 2018, with an attendance**
rate of 100%. The Committee worked together with the Corporate Committee on the implementation of a plan to renew the
company’s governance including the accelerated renewal of the Board of Directors. The Committee reviewed the
independence of members of the Board of Directors.

The Nominations Committee and the Remuneration Committee have sought external technical research.

**Safety and Security Committee**

_Composition and duties set out in the internal rules_

The Safety and Security Committee is composed of Jean-Pierre Trotignon (Chairman), Jacques Gounon and Patricia Hewitt.
This Committee is tasked with monitoring safety and security issues within each sector of activity of the Group.

_Composition, duties and proceedings in 2017_

The Committee met seven times in 2017 to discuss matters relating to the Concession, with an attendance rate of 75%.

The Committee monitors individual and collective safety and performance indicators for the corresponding action plans. The
Committee also monitors workplace accident indicators for Fixed Link employees and subcontractors present on the site; it
supports measures launched to improve results in this area and, in particular, those aimed at developing a safety culture
within the organisation. Security (prevention of attempts to illegally cross the Channel and illegal intrusions onto the
Coquelles site, coordination with government authorities to strengthen controls, cybersecurity) remains an important concern
for the Committee.

Just as in previous years, rail safety including changes in the Truck Shuttle superstructures, the inspection of
tarpaulin-covered trucks and the detection of over-height antennae were regularly monitored.

Above all, the Committee spent four meetings discussing the safety of the ElecLink project and its interface with the
Concession, both during the works phase and during the future operation of the cable.

The committee also met twice to consider issues related to the Group subsidiary Europorte: it monitors the safety indicators
and the employee training and awareness actions implemented. The Committee also analyses the key incidents affecting
operations and considers remedies.

Lastly, the Committee held a meeting at the end of 2017 jointly with the Audit Committee to review risks.

The key operational managers attend each of the Committee meetings with regards to their area of the business:

for the Concession: the Chief Operating Officer for the Concession, the safety director, the security director, the public
affairs director and the internal audit director. When ElecLink is discussed they are joined by the CEO of ElecLink and
his colleagues in charge of the safety of the project; and


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

for Europorte: the managing director of the subsidiary, the operations director and the safety manager.

Other managers may attend the Committee meetings depending on the matters under consideration by the Committee, in
particular, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and the Group’s safety director.

The Committee met once between the start of this year and 20 February 2018.

**Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee**

_Composition and duties set out in the internal rules_

The Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee considers all questions concerning the strategic and environmental
objectives of the company or the Group and reports on these to the Board.

In its strategic function, the Committee intervenes in the following fields:

strategic objectives of GET SE and the Group,

significant acquisition or disposal transactions and strategic partnership agreements,

sizeable internal restructuring operations,

operations outside the approved strategy of GET SE or the Group,

significant financing operations or those likely to substantially change the financial structure of GET SE or the Group.

In its sustainable development role, this Committee, which was founded as part of the Group’s longstanding policy on health,
safety and the environment, is responsible for considering the performance of GET SE and the Group in environmental
matters and the strategic objectives designed to promote good environmental management, preserve natural resources and
limit the impact of GET SE and the Group’s activities on the environment.

The Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee is composed of a maximum of four Directors appointed by the Board.
The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GET SE is a member of the Committee. The Strategy and Sustainable
Development Committee meets at least once every six months, and is convened by its chairman. Depending on the agenda,
the Committee may invite persons who deal with issues relating to sustainable development in the various parts of the
business and representatives from the various operational departments of GET SE, the Group or the rail freight subsidiaries.

_Composition, duties and proceedings in 2017_

Until 18 December 2017, this Committee was composed of Tim Yeo, Chairman, Philippe Camu, Peter Levene and Jacques
Gounon. The Committee met twice in 2017. The attendance rate of the Committee was 100%.

In its strategic role, the Committee examined various development projects and monitored the progress of the project to run
a high-voltage direct current cable through the Tunnel, providing interconnector capacity between France and England.

As part of its environmental brief, the Committee contributed to formalise the Group’s CSR policy, as indicated in chapter 6
of this Registration Document, which sets the environmental priorities of a long-term sustainable development programme
built around the themes used in the Group’s overall CSR strategy and detailing targets and requirements for each proposal.

On 18 December 2017, this Committee merged with the Ethics and Governance Committee to form the Corporate
Committee.

**Ethics and Governance Committee**

_Composition and duties set out in the internal rules_

The growth and longevity of the Group cannot be envisaged without sharing a common heritage of ethical values and
principles, which must inspire and guide the everyday actions of all the men and women of the Group. In order to enable
the Directors to encourage best governance and ethical practices in the Group, the Board set up the Ethics and Governance
Committee, to perform the following specific tasks:

to develop and recommend to the Board corporate governance principles applicable to the company and monitor their
subsequent implementation;

to ensure ethical conduct and discuss any related matters that the Board (or its chairman) submits for examination.

The Ethics and Governance Committee ensures that the ethics culture and the governance principles applicable to all the
employees and the executive officers are circulated within the Group.

The Ethics and Governance Committee comprises all the chairpersons of the Board’s Committees. This Committee is
chaired by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GET SE who calls meetings of the Committee. Depending on the
agenda, the Committee may invite persons who deal with issues relating to ethics and corporate governance and
representatives from the various operational departments of GET SE, the Group or its subsidiaries.

_Composition, duties and proceedings in 2017_

Until 18 December 2017, this Committee was composed of five Board members, Jacques Gounon (Chair), Colette Neuville,
Colette Lewiner, Tim Yeo and Jean-Pierre Trotignon, each of whom were chairs of Board committees so that the
predominantly ethical principles adopted by the Ethics and Governance Committee might inform the work of each of the
other committees.

It met five times in 2017 with an attendance rate of 87%. The Committee specifically reviewed the 2017 season of general
meetings of SBF120 companies, studied the comments and observations received from investors ahead of the General
Meeting of Groupe Eurotunnel SE of 27 April 2017, analysed the AMF annual report on governance and compensation and
that of the Haut Comité de Gouvernement d’Entreprise (corporate governance main committee). The Committee decided
upon the actions to be taken and gave guidelines for the work of the various Board committees in 2018, identifying areas

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

for improvement. The Committee monitored the implementation of the compliance structure and the application of the
compliance programme. The Committee also considered the implementation of the so-called Rebsamen Law of 17 August
2015 on social dialogue and employment, which provides for the appointment of an employee representative with voting
rights to boards of directors. The Committee worked together with the Nominations Committee on the implementation of a
plan to renew the company’s governance including the accelerated renewal of the Board of Directors.

**Corporate Committee**

The Corporate Committee is the result of the merger of the Ethics and Governance Committee and the Strategy and
Sustainable Development Committee.

It was formed on 18 December 2017 and is chaired by Tim Yeo. Its other members are Patricia Hewitt, Colette Lewiner,
Colette Neuville, Perrette Rey, Peter Levene, Jean-Pierre Trotignon, Philippe Vasseur and Jacques Gounon.

The Committee met once between the start of this year and 20 February 2018 to discuss the presentation to the market of
environmental data for 2017, the refinancing project, development opportunities and the development of the ElecLink project
and corporate governance. It also considered investor feedback gathered during governance roadshows, identified areas of
improvement and oversaw the practical steps needed to deliver them.

**Energy Committee**

The Board of Directors set up, on a temporary basis, a committee in charge of monitoring the ElecLink project as regards
the financial, economic and commercial aspects of the project, as well as the regulatory constraints (national and European)
whilst the Safety and Security Committee monitors the safety and security aspects.

The Energy Committee comprises five members chosen from among the Directors. The Board nominated the following:

Patricia Hewitt, Chair,

Tim Yeo,

Jacques Gounon,

Colette Lewiner, and

Philippe Camu.

The Committee met three times in 2017 with an attendance rate of 100%. On 21 November 2017, the Board of Directors
decided to dissolve the Energy Committee and form an Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee.

**Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee**

The rail transport and electricity distribution sectors have undergone a number of major reorganisations initiated directly by
the public authorities when setting up a single European market. Since the 1990s, a range of economic regulatory measures
have been implemented to control these activities:

The organisation of the rail transport sector has substantially modified to guarantee all market players the same access
conditions to essential infrastructures, necessitating the independence of transport network managers.

The number of regulatory authorities has increased: the French Rail Regulator (ARAFER), the French Energy Regulatory
Commission (CRE), the French financial markets regulator (AMF), competition authorities (DGCCRF). ARAFER and the
[UK Office of Rail & Road (ORR) signed an agreement providing for cooperation based on reciprocity and transparency,](http://www.orr.gov.uk/)
in order to define guidelines for coordinated and efficient cooperation between the two authorities in the economic
regulation of the Channel Tunnel.

In the face of these developments and without prejudice to the Group’s administrative and management bodies, the Board
of Directors decided to form a committee tasked with monitoring these economic regulations.

_Composition/proceedings_

The Committee has a maximum of five members who appoint a Chairman or Chairwoman. Meetings are convened by the
Chairman/Chairwoman. The Board of Directors appointed the following Directors to the Committee:

Patricia Hewitt, Chairwoman;

Corinne Bach;

Jean-Pierre Trotignon;

Tim Yeo; and

Jacques Gounon.

_Duties_

The Committee is responsible for monitoring:

the efficiency of internal control systems monitoring the proper application of segregation of duty principles and other
measures set out in the economic regulations;

relations with the supervisory authorities and regulators;

approval/certification/licence processes and related retention processes;

economic regulation monitoring processes implemented in the Group.

The duties of the Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee fall within the recognised roles and powers of Directors. They
do not involve the daily monitoring of activities, as Committee members have only a limited amount of time and resources.


-----

###### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Monitoring does not require continuous action by the Committee but should enable it to act at any time it considers necessary
or appropriate.

For example, the Committee is not involved in setting the pricing policy for rail transport or electricity distribution activities,
but ensures that account is taken of regulatory provisions such that these policies comply with economic regulations.

Where, based on information received, the Committee identifies warning signs, it meets with general management and,
where necessary, communicates information to the Board of Directors. The Committee’s role is not to replace general
management or act directly where it has knowledge of a failure or a risk of failure. The Committee’s monitoring role requires
members to take a step back using summary information, to gain an adequate understanding of the procedures implemented
and the main results of controls performed. It reports regularly to the Board of Directors on the exercise of its duties and
informs it immediately of any difficulties encountered.

**_4.2.6 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ SELF-ASSESSMENT_**

An assessment of the Board is carried out each year in accordance with recommendation 9 of the Afep/Medef Code in a
process overseen by the Senior Independent Director. The assessment is based on a detailed anonymous questionnaire
addressing the roles and skills of the Board, its functioning as a whole and the individual areas of its activity and that of its
committees. Using a questionnaire makes the assessment process more objective and, as a result, the assessments made
by the Directors may be weighted.

This questionnaire comprises 74 questions around six main themes:

composition of the Board and term of office;

meetings of the Board (organisation of meetings, Directors’ access to information, content and quality of debates,
relations with committees, Directors’ training, minutes);

internal rules;

attendance fees;

quality of the assessment;

role and performance of specialised committees.

11 questions relate to the committees (common items and specific items).

All members of the Board (other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Bertrand Badré who was appointed on
18 December 2017), namely nine Board Directors, responded. They were invited to give a score of 1 to 5 with
1 corresponding to “fully satisfied” and 5 to “totally unsatisfied”.

The Senior Independent Director presented an analysis of the findings to the Board. It was the subject of a specific agenda
item at its meeting on 30 January 2018.

The overall average score is 1.41 (1.33 in 2016 and 1.42 in 2015). The overall opinion of Directors on the Board and its
workings is largely positive. The Directors confirmed their satisfaction regarding the quality of the relations between the
Directors, the quality of discussions, the information provided to the Directors, as well as the number of committees, their
membership, the number of meetings and the attendance of the members. With an average score of 1.30, the effective
contribution of each Director to the proceedings of the Board (skills and involvement) was considered very satisfactory. The
Board discussed the manner in which it operates in a collegiate pooling of impartial views, and considered pragmatic ways
to improve and how these might be put into practice through specific actions. The areas of improvement as highlighted by
the assessment mostly related to the need to increase the participation of executive officers in Board meetings, as well as
the co-ordination of the work of the Board with that of the Strategy Committee and reporting on the work programme and
work of the committees. In order to respond to this expectation, the Strategy and Sustainable Development committee has
merged with the Ethics and Governance Committee. The Board anticipates that the next evaluation will be conducted using
the assistance of external consultants.

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

**5.1** **REMUNERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS**

**_5.1.1 REMUNERATION POLICY (EX-ANTE VOTE)_**

The following constitutes the remuneration policy of the executive officers in accordance with article L. 225-37-2 of the
French Commercial Code. This policy sets out the principles and the criteria applicable to the determination, allocation and
distribution of the fixed, variable and exceptional elements that make up the total remuneration and benefits of any kind
relating to the executive officers of Groupe Eurotunnel SE.

The remuneration policy for the executive officers (namely the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief
Executive Officer) as set out below was agreed by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2018, upon the proposal of the
Remuneration Committee. In accordance with the French law of 9 December 2016 on transparency, anti-corruption and
modernisation of economic life, known as the “Sapin 2 Law”, this policy will be the subject of a vote by the General Meeting.

**a)** **Principles**

**Executive officers in office**

Following the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board wishes the remuneration policy for the executive
officers, to be simple, to offer continuity over time and to be consistent with the Group’s remuneration overall policy,
especially with the policy relating to management. The remuneration for the executive officers is linked to medium- and longterm growth, to the intrinsic value of the company and to the share performance.

The Board has decided that the remuneration policy should take into account all the business’s key challenges (whether
strategic, workforce-related, societal and environmental), and not merely financial performance.

Upon the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, the Board ensures that the remuneration of the executive officers is
consistent with the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders, and that the different components of their
remuneration (fixed and variable remuneration, share options or shares and the grant of additional retirement benefits as
the case may be) are commensurate and compliant with the principles set out in the Afep/Medef Code. The Board intends
that the criteria should not create a risk of encouraging executive officers to favour short term goals that could influence their
variable remuneration and that may have a negative influence on the company in the medium and long term.

In particular, the Board strives to adhere to the following guidelines:

Completeness: all elements that form part of the remuneration of executive officers are reviewed each year: the fixed
and variable elements and long-term plans, benefits in kind, attendance fees and retirement conditions.

Intelligibility of the rules and balance: the rules are simple, stable, transparent and, as far as is possible, long-lasting;
each element of the remuneration is clearly substantiated and is in keeping with the general interest of the business: the
variable part intended to reflect the actual contribution of the executive officers to the success of the Group changes
according to criteria representing the results of the Group as well as the operational targets set for the year.

At the start of each financial year, the Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, defines each of
the objectives set for the executive officers for the relevant year and determines what proportion of the overall variable
portion each of them may obtain. After the close of the financial year, the Remuneration Committee evaluates the
achievement of the targets and, based on recommendations from the Committee, the Board decides the variable part to
be awarded to each chief executive officer. The variable remuneration awarded for a given financial year is therefore
paid in the following year:

   - The part based on the achievement of targets linked to the Group’s intrinsic annual performance is based on financial
indicators determined according to Group objectives; 50% of the remuneration of the executive officers is based on
financial indicators which are renewed year after year with a concern for sustainability and clarity: since 2010, the
financial criteria used for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are EBITDA and net profit.

   - The part based on the achievement of operational targets is based on criteria set taking into account strategic
objectives contained in the strategic plan and the five-year plan agreed by the Board, which correspond to required
short-term actions, which are essential for the company in the medium- to long-term. From the outset, Groupe
Eurotunnel SE’s executive officer remuneration policy has been designed to support the high-level development
vision of the company and that is what prevails when the remuneration criteria are being decided:

    - to ensure the viability of the company in the first phase of Groupe Eurotunnel SE’s history, when the choice of
criteria was linked to the financial restructuring of Eurotunnel or the completion of the public exchange offer;

    - then to operational priorities to support the development strategy of the company, such as the development of
commercial activities, with the choice of criteria being linked to market share and the yield policy and to
innovations in customer service (refurbishment of the club car carriages, digitalisation plan);

    - all while having regard to the preservation of infrastructure, with the choice of criteria being those such as the
Salamandre plan, the creation of specialist fire-fighting areas – SAFE stations – or the long-term improvement of
the security arrangements for the Fixed Link and more generally to protect the business.
The strategy of the Group is orientated towards responsible growth, having regard for all stakeholders: the use of a
social performance criterion is a reflection of the history and values of the Group, which from the start has committed
itself to a social responsibility policy that is designed to reconcile economic performance, social justice and protection
of the environment. Since 2012, CSR has been one of the criteria that determine the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer’s variable remuneration (10%). Initially, the criterion was called “Quality of social dialogue in support of
performance”. Faced with the challenge of quantifying this criterion, the Remuneration Committee wished to formalise
matters so in 2014 the Nomination and Remuneration Committee started a discussion around the creation of a CSR

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

composite performance index. The Group asked an external firm to create a benchmark relating to the practices of
CAC 40 companies and conducted a qualitative inquiry of its internal and external stakeholders. This identified four
topics directly linked to Group operations, namely: health and safety; the social climate; greenhouse gas emissions
and customer satisfaction. Indicators and targets have been set for each of these topics in order to be able to
determine the rate of achievement of each target. The index has been used since 2015.

   - The long-term incentive plans are based on internal and external performance criteria so as to align the long-term
financial interests of the shareholders, in such a way as to enhance the decisions of the managers, which are crucial
for the future of the company, and which could have an impact only over the long term.

   - Measurement: remuneration is determined taking into account the general interests of the business, market practices
and the performance of the executive officers. Each year, the Remuneration Committee receives benchmarking
information relating to comparable organisations from an independent firm specialising in the remuneration of
executive leaders. In addition, after a detailed study the Group established an international sectoral panel including
the following companies: Abertis Infraestructuras SA, Aena SME SA, Atlantia SpA, DFDS A/S, Eiffage SA, Engie SA,
Ferrovial SA, Firstgroup PLC, Flughafen Zurich AG, Fraport AG, National Grid PLC, Stagecoach Group PLC, Vinci
SA and Aéroports de Paris.

Internal and external consistency: the Remuneration Committee ensures that the remuneration policy proposed to the
Board of Directors is:

   - adapted to each individual’s responsibilities;

   - consistent with the remuneration policy for the employees of the Group;

   - in line with comparable groups; in order to consider the consistency of the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the Committee examines the positioning of their
remuneration in relation to remuneration paid by peer groups; and

   - linked to the performance of the ordinary shares of GET SE, in order to optimise the performance of committed capital
and to align incentives between executive officers and shareholders.

**b)** **When executive officers take up or leave their posts**

In accordance with the Afep/Medef Code, a “golden hello” payment, which is payable on taking up new duties can be
awarded only to a new chief executive officer coming from a company outside of the Group to offset the loss of advantages
that the executive may have benefited from in his previous position. The payment must be explicit and the amount must be
made public when it is set, even in the case of a deferred payment or payment in instalments.

The predefined payment, to be made when ceasing the functions of a chief executive officer, are subject to prior approval
under the procedure set for regulated agreements. The departure indemnity must not exceed, where applicable, two years
of remuneration (annual fixed and variable).

When a non-competition clause is furthermore stipulated, the Board of Directors has to resolve whether or not to apply the
clause at the time of the departure of the chief executive officer, in particular when the chief executive officer is leaving the
company to avail himself of or after having availed himself of his retirement rights.

In any case, the total amount of the two payments cannot exceed this ceiling of two years of remuneration (annual fixed and
variable). The ceiling also covers, where applicable, payments linked to employment contract termination.

**c)** **Breakdown of the remuneration of executive officers in office**

The remuneration awarded to the executives is structured in a balanced way so as to reward both short- and long-term
performance. The remuneration awarded to the executive officers differs in amount and criteria, so as to take into account
the nature of their office, in terms of experience and responsibilities.

**i.** **Remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 2018**

The remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is comprised of:

a fixed annual remuneration;

an annual variable remuneration subject to performance criteria;

attendance fees;

benefits in kind;

a supplementary defined contribution retirement plan;

a long-term variable remuneration in the form of free shares granted subject to performance criteria.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is not entitled to any contractual severance or non-competition payments. He is
not eligible to benefit from the collective schemes for the allocation of free shares that are in place within the Group for all
the employees.

The Board of Directors has been careful to keep a balance between the three parts of the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer’s remuneration by re-balancing the variable elements to ensure that long-term remuneration (i.e. over three years)
is greater than short-term remuneration.

**Annual fixed remuneration for 2018**

The Remuneration Committee considered the results of a study carried out by Mercer, a firm specialising in the study of
executive remuneration, which compared the relative remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive to that of his peers,


-----

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

and noted that his fixed annual remuneration (€500,000) was below the first quartile (€663,000) and that it was much less
than the average (€773,900). After discussion with investors and various voting agencies during Groupe Eurotunnel SE
governance roadshows and in light of the results of votes at recent General Meetings, the Board of Directors decided to
carry out the rebalancing. Even when increased to €600,000 gross per year, the fixed part of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer’s remuneration is still below the first quartile (€663,000) and much less than the average (€773,900).

The fixed part of the gross annual remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer set at €500,000 since 2013, is
increased to €600,000 with effect from 1 April 2018.

This increase consists of (i) 10% due to the re-evaluation of the fixed part of his salary, in line with average inflation for the
period in France and the UK, as well as the average increase in salaries in the Group over the period and (ii) 10% in the
interests of balancing firstly the overall structure of the remuneration in which the variable elements were more than 70% of
the whole and equally the fixed amount, taking the gap between market practice for similar roles into account in order to be
able to attract and keep the talent necessary for the success of the Group.

**Annual variable remuneration for 2018**

Annual variable remuneration is intended to reflect the personal contribution of the head of a Group to an improvement in
its results. It is balanced in proportion to the fixed remuneration and determined as a percentage of the fixed remuneration.

The variable part of annual remuneration is determined using a target remuneration equal to 120% of the annual fixed
remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The cap is set at 120% of fixed remuneration. Payment of the
annual variable remuneration is not deferred (beyond the General Meeting vote). It is made up of criteria relevant to the
strategy of the business. For 2018, it is made up of 50% quantitative financial criteria (net result and EBITDA) aimed at
rewarding economic performance, 10% on quantitative CSR criteria and 40% on qualitative criteria.

_Quantitative objectives_

Consolidated net result for the year compared with the net result forecast in the budget (25%); at a constant exchange
rate and over the whole scope of current activities: Fixed Link, Europorte and ElecLink.

EBITDA target (25%) as set by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2018: €545 million in 2018, based on an exchange
rate of £1=€1.14 for current continuing activities: Fixed Link, Europorte and ElecLink.

_Qualitative objectives_

Implementation of Group strategy (20%) including for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:

   - Co-ordination of the work of the Chief Operating Officers in relation to the implementation of new objectives for the
period of the five-year plan; digital development; quality of service;

   - Actions to ensure a smooth Brexit transition, representing the Group in its relations with governments and the
business’s political partners;

   - Actions to develop the Railway Companies’ traffic:

     - Putting an ETICA in place for passenger traffic;

     - Contact with the Railway Companies to stimulate the launch of services to new destinations;

     - Initiatives aimed at reducing barriers to the development of new and existing services (safety and border
controls, authorisation of rolling stock, investment in inter-operability, etc.), in particular in co-operation with rail
infrastructure managers.

   - ElecLink (certification: control procedures relating to compliance by transport network managers with the organisation
and independence rules of companies carrying out a production or supply activity);

Evolution of governance (10%), towards:

   - Against the background of preparations to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a project
being led by the Nominations Committee: transition to a disassociated form of governance within two years. The role
of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will be in particular to ensure the cohesion of the overall approach;
process to appoint a Chief Executive Officer; a multi-dimensional process that will take account of the competences
and qualities needed for the business’s current state of development;

   - Rejuvenation of and acceleration of the rotation of the Board Directors;

   - Internal reorganisation: after completion of the stage relating to the contribution in kind of the Concession referred to
in section 1.1.2 of this Registration Document and reflecting on the optimal financing arrangements, complete the
transition of the governance so as to be in a positon to accomplish the Group’s 2018 objectives and more generally
achieve overall effectiveness. Implement the new financial and operational structure with the emphasis on the
necessary collective and collaborative aspects and in accordance with the Group strategy;

Contact with investors and evolution of the shareholding (10%): further developing relations with investors and monitoring
of shareholder relations and shareholder support.

_Quantitative objectives_

Composite CSR Index (10%): for 2018, the Board has decided to maintain the composite CSR performance index which is
stable, relevant, and balanced. This index is structured around four themes directly related to the Group’s operations:
health/safety, social climate, greenhouse gas emissions and customer satisfaction.

For each of these themes, indicators and targets enable the calculation of an achievement rate of the composite index:
(i) health and safety at work; (ii) absenteeism; (iii) greenhouse gas emissions; and (iv) customer satisfaction. The composite
index corresponds to the average percentage achievement of the indicators referred to, with a multiplication coefficient

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

weighted towards the environmental indicator. The social and environmental indicators are certified every year by the
auditors in their capacity as an independent third-party organisation.

_Methodology_

The budgetary targets for 2018 were determined according to the Group’s forecast budget, as reviewed by the Board. For
confidentiality reasons, the quantitative targets set for each of the above quantitative criteria are not disclosed.

The financial data is adjusted for exceptional external factors, if any, in order to neutralise their impact and keep genuinely
comparable data: at a constant exchange rate and on a comparable basis.

The annual variable remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is adjusted according to a scale, depending
on the degree of achievement of the target concerned. The Board of Directors has decided to update the scale to take
account of the economic advances made by the Group since the scale was first introduced, by removing the lower
achievement levels (80 and 85%) and refining the higher ones.

**Payment rate (EBITDA and operating cash flow)**

Achievement rate -2.10 -1.05 **Target** +1.05 +2.10 +3.15 +4.21 **Maximum**

Payment rate 93.34% 95% **100%** 105% 107% 112% 115% **120%**

**Payment rate (quantitative and non-financial targets)**

Achievement rate 90% 95% **Target** **120%**
Linear interpolation

Payment rate 80% 90% **100%** **120%**

This scale enables the over-performance of some criteria to be taken into account, without however the total amount
exceeding the maximum of 120% set by the Board for the variable part of the remuneration.

**Long-term variable benefits for 2018**

Remuneration in shares is an essential element for Getlink to make itself attractive as an employer since it seeks to converge
the interests of employees and shareholders and to strengthen employees’ attachment to the Group.

Each year, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee the Board of Directors proposes a Long Term Incentive
(LTI) plan in respect of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to the General Meeting in the form of performance or
preference shares convertible into ordinary shares.

The Board has set a principle whereby no single executive officer may receive more than 10% of any allocation of shares.
Moreover, in order to respond to the expectations of certain investors, an absolute cap of 200,000 ordinary shares was
agreed by the Board on 20 February 2018 in respect of any allocation to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which
represents 0.036% of the current share capital.

The Board’s policy in this respect is characterised by control of the dilution of capital and multiple performance conditions
spread over a number of years. The LTI shares allocated to the Chairman and Chief Executive are wholly subject to internal
and external performance conditions that are demanding, measured over a minimum period of three years and that do not
guarantee a minimum allocation or gain. Ordinary shares in the LTI plans are shares purchased by the business under the
buy-back scheme.

For a number of years while operating the LTI scheme, the Group used the Dow Jones Infrastructure index to measure the
performance of the GET ordinary share. However, this index includes stocks in respect of which the core activity is very
remote from that of the Group (including satellite operators such as SES and Eutelsat, and gas and oil stocks such as
Enagas and Vopak). The Dow Jones Infrastructure index contains a company that makes up more than a quarter of the
index (National Grid at 26%) and does not include some companies whose activities are closer to those of the Group (such
as Vinci, Eiffage and DFDS). The Group wished to find a more representative index of its activities so in the interests of
improving the relevance of the comparison it worked with an external firm, a subsidiary of the Dutch bank Kempen & Co and
a specialist in creating indices to construct an index composed of stocks representative of the Group’s activities.

This index (GPR Getlink Index), which has been created entirely independently by this firm and is in accordance with a
methodology laid down and conforming with the EU directive UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investments in
Transferable Securities), includes:

European transport infrastructure companies reflecting the Fixed Link activities such as Vinci, Atlantia and ADP;

British transport companies reflecting Getlink’s exposure to the United Kingdom (Stagecoach and Firstgroup);

a ferry operator for the cross-Channel activity (DFDS); and

electricity companies in anticipation of the ElecLink’s contribution to results (EDF, Engie and National Grid).

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

On 18 April 2018, the General Meeting will be asked to authorise the granting of up to 1,500,000 ordinary shares with
performance criteria to executives and senior managers including the executive officers. The final allocation of the ordinary
shares would be based on achieving the following three cumulative performance criteria (with one being external to the
Group and the two others internal to the Group):

the **external performance condition (the “TSR weighting”) would be based on the average performance including**
dividends (TSR) of the GET ordinary share over a period of three years compared to the Group sector index GPR Getlink
Index. This element determines 40% of the total number of shares that can be granted. The final attribution of ordinary
shares linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective, it being borne in mind
that:

   - should the TSR of the GET ordinary share be strictly less than the performance of the index over the aforementioned
period of three years, no shares will be granted;

   - should the TSR of the GET ordinary share be equal to the performance the index over the aforementioned period of
three years, 15% of the number that can be granted will be granted, with the whole being capped at 40% of the
number that can be granted;

the first internal performance condition (the “EBITDA weighting”) would be based on the Group’s financial performance,
assessed by reference to the average rate of achievement of EBITDA over a period of two years covering 2018, 2019
and 2020 at constant exchange rates and comparable scope. This element determines **50% of the total number of**
shares that can be granted. The final attribution of shares linked to this condition would vary according to the degree of
achievement of the objective, it being borne in mind that:

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018, 2019 and 2020 be strictly less than 100% of the average
of the EBITDA communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, no shares will be granted; and

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018, 2019 and 2020 be equal to 100% of the average of the
EBITDA target communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, 15% of the number that can
be granted will effectively be granted, with the whole being capped at 50% of the number that can be granted;

the second internal performance condition (the “CSR weighting”) would be based on the Group CSR composite index
described above. This element determines 10% of the total number of shares that can be granted.

The exact number of ordinary shares that would be acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period would
depend on the degree of achievement of the performance, keeping in mind that should the target objective not be met, no
shares would be granted and that starting at 100% achievement, the grant would be made according to a progressive scale
in stages, depending on the degree of achievement of the objectives. 100% of the shares would be acquired only if the
global weighted performance reaches 112%.

In accordance with article L. 225-185 of the French Commercial Code, Jacques Gounon, as a chief executive officer, shall
keep for the entire term of his appointment, 50% of the ordinary shares allotted upon exercise of the options granted under
the various schemes.

Furthermore, pursuant to the recommendations of the Afep/Medef Code, Jacques Gounon has reiterated in writing his
commitment not to undertake hedging transactions.

In case of retirement from the legal age onwards, the overall allocation rate will be applied pro rata to take account of the
effective presence of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in the Group during the acquisition period.

**Benefits in kind and attendance fees for 2018**

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer receives an allowance for the use of his personal vehicle in accordance with the
current Human Resources Group company car scheme.

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

**Annual fixed remuneration for 2018**

The fixed part of the annual gross remuneration of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer is increased from €390,000 to
€400,000 as from 1 May 2018. The positioning of the remuneration of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer was assessed with
respect to the responsibilities assumed and by taking into account the levels of remuneration granted for the executive
officers of comparable companies, as well as the remuneration policy of the members of the Executive Committee.

**Annual variable remuneration for 2018**

The variable part of the annual remuneration of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer is determined using a target remuneration
equal to 65% of the annual fixed remuneration. It changes according to the criteria that represent the results of the Group.
The ceiling is set at 65% of fixed remuneration. The payment of variable remuneration is not deferred.

90% of this remuneration is subject to quantitative criteria of which 50% corresponds to two financial criteria: EBITDA and
operating cash flow.

_Quantitative objectives (financial)_

Consolidated EBITDA target (25%): set on 20 February 2018: €545 million for 2018, based on an exchange rate of
£1=€1.14 for current continuing activities: Fixed Link, Europorte and ElecLink.

Consolidated operating cash flow for the year, compared with the amount forecast in the budget (25%) at a constant
exchange rate and for current continuing activities: Fixed Link, Europorte and ElecLink.

_Quantitative objectives (operational) (40%)_

Concession (35%): objective criteria of which 25% are quantitative:

   - Increase in Truck market share on the Short Straits by one point, while maintaining yield (7.5%);

   - Quality of service (10%), measured via four KPIs namely adherence to the timetable, mystery shopper scores and
complaints;

   - Digitalisation plan: implementation and follow-up; including the completion of 80% of phase 1 of the plan (7.5%);

ElecLink (10%): achievement of the project according to the technical plan and the budget;

Europorte (5%): consolidate its return to profitability by pursuing developments in line with the strategic plan and the
budget.

_Quantitative objectives (operational) (10%)_

Concession: human resources: management of the managerial transition.

_Methodology_

The budgetary targets for 2018 were determined according to the Group’s budget as reviewed by the Board. For
confidentiality reasons, the quantitative targets set for each of the above quantitative criteria are not disclosed.

The financial data is adjusted for exceptional external factors, if any, in order to neutralise their impact and keep genuinely
comparable data: at a constant exchange rate and on a like-for-like basis.

The annual variable remuneration of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer is adjusted according to a scale, depending on the
degree of achievement of the target concerned. The Board of Directors has decided to update the scale to take account of
the economic advances made by the Group since the scale was first introduced, by removing the lower achievement levels
(80 and 85%) and refining the higher ones.

**Payment rate (EBITDA and operating cash flow)**

Achievement rate -2.10 -1.05 **Target** +1.05 +2.10 +3.15 +4.21 **Maximum**

Payment rate 93.34% 95% **100%** 105% 107% 112% 115% **120%**

**Payment rate (quantitative and non-financial targets)**

Achievement rate 90% 95% **Target** **120%**
Linear interpolation

Payment rate 80% 90% **100%** **120%**

This scale enables the over-performance of some criteria to be taken into account, without however the total amount
exceeding the maximum of 65% set by the Board for the variable part of the remuneration.

**Long-term variable benefits for 2018**

As for the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the General Meeting on 18 April 2018 will be asked to
authorise the granting to senior officers, including the executive officers, of 1,500,000 ordinary shares subject to performance
criteria, with the number granted to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer being limited to 10% of the full grant. The final granting
of the ordinary shares would be conditional on the achievement of the three cumulative performance criteria which are
identical to the 2017 scheme (with one being external to the Group and the two others internal to the Group).


-----

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

**Benefits in kind for 2018**

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer has a company car, which represents a benefit in kind worth €242.45 per month.

**Supplementary defined contribution pension plan/death and disability insurance for 2018**

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer does not have a defined benefit pension plan. He benefits from the same supplementary
pension plan offered to all senior managers above the B remuneration bracket. This plan, whose beneficiaries include people
other than the Group’s executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. It is a defined contribution plan which would currently
grant the Deputy Chief Executive Officer an estimated pension of €8,633 per year (non-commutable annuity), assuming
retirement at the age of 65.

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer is covered by the staff private death and disability insurance and the personal accident
policy available to employees of GET SE.

**_5.1.2 REMUNERATION OWED OR AWARDED FOR THE 2017 FINANCIAL YEAR (EX-POST VOTE)_**

In accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code, the elements that make up the total
remuneration and benefits of any kind paid or granted for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 to Jacques Gounon,
by reason of his office of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to François Gauthey by reason of his office of Deputy
CEO are set out below. These elements accord with the rules and principles agreed in respect of the determination of
remuneration and benefits of any kind applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy CEO for the
2017 financial year and approved by the 2017 General Meeting.

Article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code arising from the Sapin 2 law introduces an ex-post vote of shareholders
that is different from the advisory vote previously carried out by issuers under the Afep/Medef code. Whereas the Afep/Medef
code provided for an advisory vote on the remuneration due or awarded for the previous financial year to each executive
officer, the new law provides for a binding vote which has the following characteristics:

the vote is on the items paid or granted for the previous financial year;

the variable or exceptional remuneration elements can only be paid after approval of the said remuneration by the
General Meeting which will vote ex-post.

The remuneration due or awarded to the executive officers in respect of the 2017 financial year is subject to the vote of the
General Meeting on 18 April 2018. The compensation amounts shown in this chapter cover all the remuneration due or
granted to chief executive officers, for all their offices or functions within the Group.

**a)** **Remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 2017**

The remuneration owed to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jacques Gounon, for 2017 is comprised of:

a fixed annual remuneration;

an annual variable remuneration subject to performance criteria;

attendance fees;

benefits in kind;

a supplementary defined contribution retirement plan;

a long-term variable remuneration in the form of free shares granted subject to performance criteria.

**Annual fixed remuneration for 2017**

The fixed part of the gross annual remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer owed for 2017 is €500,000.

**Annual variable remuneration for 2017**

_Limit_

The ceiling for the variable part of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s annual remuneration is 120% of the annual
basic salary, calculated on the basis of a target equal to 120% of the annual fixed remuneration.

_Criteria_

The Board of Directors had decided, for the sake of consistency and transparency of information, to keep the two financial
criteria used in previous years, the criterion of the net result and the published EBITDA target. The Board decided to
maintain, as in previous years, the proportion of 50% for operational criteria, so that the performance criteria cover all the
organisation’s challenges.

Consolidated net result for the year compared with the net result estimated in the budget (25%);

EBITDA target (25%) as set on 28 February 2017: €530 million for 2017 based on an exchange rate of £1=€1.175;

ElecLink (10%): strategic leadership of the ElecLink project (balance between quality, cost and time);

Completion of the debt refinancing (10%);

Consolidation of long-term security on the Coquelles site (5%);

Composite CSR Index (10%): for 2017, the Board decided to maintain the composite CSR performance index.


-----

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

_Qualitative objectives_

Long-term strategy (15%): outline of strategic orientation (objectives, financing, communication – valuation of the ordinary
share more in line with fundamentals).

The variable remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was adjusted as follows, depending on the degree
of achievement of the target concerned:

50% of the maximum if 80% of the target is achieved;

60% of the maximum if 85% of the target is achieved;

80% of the maximum if 90% of the target is achieved;

90% of the maximum if 95% of the target is achieved;

100% of the maximum if 100% of the target is achieved; with a linear progression of the percentage up to a cap of 120%.

On 13 February 2018, the Remuneration Committee examined the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
by comparing the results achieved with the above target indicators and made recommendations to the Board.

With regard to the criterion of achieved net profit, and in order to allow for a comparison on a like-for-like basis and at the
same exchange rate, so as to use data that is genuinely comparable, the net result generated in 2017 was recalculated at
the rate of exchange at which the budget had been prepared and to exclude net exchange gains. After restatement, the
level of achievement of the target, and the level of achievement excluding the restatement, were both met with more
than 100%. The Committee noted that in either case, the bonus would be capped at €150,000.

The Committee noted that for the EBITDA objective calculated on the basis of an exchange rate of £1=€1.175, had been
achieved with 101.02% of the 25%.

With regard to refinancing, the Committee noted the partial refinancing of the debt concluded on 6 June 2017, which allowed
the Group to:

reduce its annual interest payments by around €50 million a year and its income statement financial charges by an
estimated €7 million a year, over the next five years; and

lower the average annual cost of its Term Loan excluding indexation, which is lower than 4% over the same period
(compared to 6% previously).

The Committee welcomed the work carried out on the third stage of the financial reorganisation by completing an agreement
to buy the G2 bonds held by FMS in order to advance the process of simplifying the structure and thereby optimising the
financing. The Committee considered that this objective had been fully achieved (€60,000).

In relation to finalising the long-term security of the site, the Committee considered the adequacy of the expenditure and
security measures taken and the pursuit of technological surveillance. The Committee agreed with the approach taken to
secure the site by means of a follow up of the risk analysis and the installation of inherent prevention measures, through the
use of adapted and evolving arrangements. The Committee appreciated the tripartite process (infrastructure expenditure,
deployment of human resources and relations with the States) and their results, and declared that the objective had been
achieved (100%).

With regard to the ElecLink project, the Committee acknowledged the strategic leadership undertaken, with an end-to-end
smooth project flow and an appropriate balance between quality/cost/time (100%).

As for the CSR composite index, the Committee considered that, in the light of the 2017 results compared to the base values
and the marked improvement in relation to accidents, the objective was reached and the CSR index was achieved at 117%.

With regard to the long-term strategy, the Committee considered the work as a whole including the strategic plan which was
presented to the Board during the strategy seminar on 20 October 2017 and then reviewed when the five year plan was
agreed during the Board meeting on 18 December 2017. The strategy underlying these plans is presented in summary form
in section 1.1.4 of this Registration Document.

At its meeting on 20 February 2018, the Board of Directors assessed the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer by reference to the performance indicators set out above.

Following the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee and taking into account the achievements referred to, the
Board fixed the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s variable remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2017 at a
capped amount of €600,000, being a reduction of €37,345 compared to the amount that would have been due by application

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

of the criteria alone had it not been capped. Payment of this remuneration is subject to approval by the General Meeting on
18 April 2018.

**Benefits in kind and attendance fees for 2017**

For 2017, Jacques Gounon received an indemnity for the use of his personal vehicle which, in application of the Group’s
car policy cash allowance, was £800 per month, or €10,944 for the year (2016: £9,600 or €11,674 based on the exchange
rate used for the 2016 income statement).

Jacques Gounon received attendance fees for his role as a Director of GET SE as set out in the table in section 5.4.1.

**Supplementary defined contribution pension plan/death and disability insurance for 2017**

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not have a defined benefit pension plan. The Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer benefits, with respect to the French portion of his remuneration, from the same supplementary pension plan available
to any other senior managers employed above the B remuneration bracket. This plan, whose beneficiaries include people
other than the Group’s executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. It is a defined contribution plan, which would currently
grant the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer an estimated pension of €4,392 per year (non-commutable annuity),
assuming he retires at the age of 65.

Regarding contributions, the contribution base is the gross annual salary broken down by tranches (A, B, C and beyond C).
The rates applied are 0.50% on tranche A, 0.50% on tranche B, 7.50% on tranche C and 0.00% beyond the C tranche.
There is an exemption from French social security charges associated with the charge to the company within the limit of 5%
of the remuneration capped at five times the annual French social security ceiling and a fixed rate of 20% on the exempt
portion. For tax purposes, the employer contributions are deductible from the result.

In 2017, the employer contributions for this supplementary pension scheme amounted to €6,276 (2016: €6,179) out of a
total of €72,626, or 77,437 with ElecLink (2016: €70,265) for all employees concerned.

With respect to the French and British portion of his remuneration, he benefits from a basic retirement benefits and a
supplementary retirement benefits scheme. In 2017, the contributions for the supplementary pension scheme amounted to
€19,562 (2016: €19,258) for the employee contribution and €31,666 (2016: €31,172) for the employer contribution.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is covered by the staff private death and disability insurance and the personal
accident policy available to employees of GET SE.

**Long-term variable benefits for 2017**

As part of partnership governance, where the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account, Groupe Eurotunnel SE
has introduced performance-linked benefits for employees and executive officers, in the interests both of aligning employees’
and senior managers’ interests with those of shareholders and of maximising shareholder value.

The first component of the mechanism aims to involve non-executive employees in the development of the business through
collective plans for the free allocation of shares to employees. As with the previous plans, the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer was excluded from the list of employees eligible to benefit from the collective free share allocation authorised by the
General Meeting of 27 April 2017.

The second component aims to favour the performance of the senior managers over the long term, with free shares which
have performance conditions attached.

For each of these grants, the Board ensured that the grants to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer did not exceed
10% of the overall attribution for the 2017 plan.

**Performance condition shares for 2017**

For the 2017 financial year, Jacques Gounon was granted 120,000 free shares subject to performance criteria, the granting
of which was authorised by the General Meeting of 27 April 2017 which authorised the granting of a total of
1,200,000 ordinary shares at a fair value per unit of €6.93 and subject to performance criteria. The vesting of the ordinary
shares is based on achieving the following three cumulative performance criteria (with one being external to the Group and
the two others internal to the Group):

the external performance condition (the “TSR weighting”) is based on the average performance including dividends
(TSR) of the GET ordinary share over a period of three years compared to the performance of the Dow Jones
Infrastructure Index. This element determines 40% of the total number of shares that can be granted. The final attribution
of ordinary shares linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective, it being borne
in mind that:

   - should the TSR of the GET ordinary share be strictly less than the performance of the TSR of the components of the
index over the period, no shares will be granted;

   - should the TSR of the GET ordinary share be equal to the performance of the index over the period, 15% of the
number that can be granted will be granted, with the whole being capped at 40% of the number that can be granted;

the first **internal performance condition (the “EBITDA weighting”) is based on the Group’s financial performance,**
assessed by reference to the average rate of achievement of EBITDA over a period of two years covering 2018 and
2019. This element determines 50% of the total number of shares that can be granted. The final attribution of shares
linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective, it being borne in mind that:

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 be strictly less than 100% of the average of
the EBITDA communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, no shares will be granted; and


-----

###### REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 be equal to 100% of the average of the EBITDA
communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, 15% of the number that can be granted would
effectively be granted, with the whole being capped at 50% of the number that can be granted.

the second internal performance condition (the “CSR weighting”) is based on the CSR Composite Index as described in
the remuneration policy described above. This element determines 10% of the total number of shares that can be
granted.

The exact number of ordinary shares that will be acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period will depend
on the degree of achievement of the performance, keeping in mind that should the target objective not be met, no shares
will be granted and that starting at 100% achievement, the grant will be made according to a progressive scale in stages,
depending on the degree of achievement of the objectives. 100% of the shares will be acquired only if the global weighted
performance reaches 112%.

**LTI plans available in 2017**

No share plans subject to performance conditions became available during the 2017 financial year.

The class B preference shares, described in section 8.2.2 of this Registration Document, the issue of which was authorised
by the Extraordinary General Meeting of 29 April 2014, will be converted into ordinary shares on 29 April 2018, according to
the movement in the average share price between the allocation date (€8.17) and the conversion date, calculated by
reference to the six months preceding the conversion date. The class C preference shares, described in section 8.2.2 of this
Registration Document, are not yet available.

Three share option plans are in place in the organisation. In accordance with the authority conferred by the Combined
General Meeting of 26 May 2010, the Board of Directors proceeded to grant options on 16 July 2010 (2010 plan), on 21 July
2011 (2011 plan) and on 20 July 2012 (2012 plan). All options were subject to external and internal performance conditions
(EBITDA, dividends and share price):

For the 2010 plan, all performance conditions were met and so 100% of the options were acquired.

For the 2011 plan, half the performance conditions were met and so 50% of the options were acquired.

For the 2012 plan, 75% of the performance conditions were met and so 75% of the options were acquired.

**b)** **Remuneration of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for 2017**

François Gauthey has been Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Eurotunnel SE since 1 May 2016. His employment
contract has been suspended through the entire duration of his term as Deputy Chief Executive Officer.

In relation to investment plans, the Committee took particular note of the Deputy CEO’s ability to review investment plans
for the Fixed Link by reference to their complexity, cost and potential gain and to set the plans in the context of the Group’s
medium- and long-term investment strategy and evaluate their prospects for success, how realistic they are in terms of
cost/benefit and their capacity to add value.

At its meeting on 20 February 2018, the Board of Directors assessed the performance of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer
by reference to the performance indicators set out above.

Following the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee and given the recognised achievements, the Board set the

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer had a company car, which represented a benefit in kind worth €242.42 per month.

**Supplementary defined contribution pension plan/death and disability insurance for 2017**

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer does not have a defined benefit pension plan. He benefited from the same

beneficiaries extends beyond the Group’s executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. It is a defined contribution plan
which would currently grant the Deputy Chief Executive Officer an estimated pension of €8,633 per year (non-commutable
annuity), assuming retirement at the age of 65.

In 2017, employer contributions to this supplementary defined contribution pension scheme totalled €12,553 out of a total

**Compensation linked to taking up a position**

No “golden hello” payment was awarded to François Gauthey, and nor was he granted any exceptional indemnity.

**Long-term variable benefits for 2017**

For the 2017 financial year, François Gauthey was allocated 105,000 free shares, at a fair value per unit of €6.93, and
subject to performance criteria, the granting of which was authorised by the General Meeting of 27 April 2017 which
authorised the granting of a total of 1,200,000 ordinary shares subject to performance criteria. The vesting of the ordinary
shares is based on achieving the following three cumulative performance criteria (one being external to the Group and the
two others internal to the Group):

the external performance condition (the “TSR weighting”) is based on the average performance including dividends
(TSR) of the GET ordinary share over a period of three years compared to the performance of the Dow Jones
Infrastructure Index. This element determines 40% of the total number of shares that can be granted. The final attribution
of ordinary shares linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective it being borne

period of three years, no shares will be granted;

   - should the TSR of the GET ordinary share be equal to the performance of the index over the period, 15% of the
number that can be granted will be granted, with the whole being capped at 40% of the number that can be granted;

2019. This element determines 50% of the total number of shares that can be granted. The final attribution of shares
linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective, it being borne in mind that:

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 be strictly less than 100% of the average of
the EBITDA communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, no shares will be granted; and

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 be equal to 100% of the average of the EBITDA
communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, 15% of the number that can be granted would
effectively be granted, with the whole being capped at 50% of the number that can be granted.

the second internal performance condition (the “CSR weighting”) is based on the CSR composite index (the “CSR index”)
as described in the remuneration policy above, for the 2018 financial year. This element determines 10% of the total
number of shares that can be granted.

The exact number of ordinary shares that will be acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period will depend
on the degree of achievement of the performance, keeping in mind that should the target objective not be met, no shares
will be granted and that starting at 100% achievement, the grant will be made according to a progressive scale in stages,
depending on the degree of achievement of the objectives. 100% of the shares will be acquired only if the global weighted

**_5.1.3 ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT OF REMUNERATION AGAINST PERFORMANCE_**

In order to assess the remuneration against the total return for shareholders, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee
referred to two comparative analyses prepared by an independent firm (Mercer) specialising in executive compensation
studies.

The first study was designed to measure the relative remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and of the
Deputy Chief Executive Officer compared to peers. This study focused on the remuneration of chairmen and executive
officers of an inter-sectoral panel of 23 French companies in the SBF 120, with characteristics in common with the Group in
terms of number of employees and revenue. The comparison of the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer with the practice of these companies showed that:

the annual base salary of Jacques Gounon (€500,000) is below the first quartile (€663,000) and is much less than the
average (€773,900);

the annual variable remuneration in 2016 for Jacques Gounon (€550,000) is between the first quartile (€537,700) and
the median (€774,700); it is much less than the average (€794,500);

long-term share-based incentives granted in 2016 to Jacques Gounon, is around the median (€602,300);

total annual remuneration in 2016 for Jacques Gounon is less than the median (€1,993,100) and the average of the
panel (€2,352,600); and

the breakdown of the remuneration of Jacques Gounon shows that part of the variable remuneration (70%) is slightly
more significant than for the other companies in question.

The annual fixed remuneration of François Gauthey (€390,000 for a full year) is very close to the median (€400,000) and
is within the average (€391,800). His potential maximum annual variable remuneration is around the median (€258,300)
and translates into an annual cash total above the first quartile (€430,200) and below the average (€720,800). His
long-term share remuneration for 2017 is above the third quartile.

The second study was designed to assess changes in the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in
relation to that of the relative performance of the company compared to the panel of its peers as used for the Group’s sectoral
index, consisting of twelve comparable companies in terms of nature of business: Abertis Infraestructuras SA, Atlantia SpA,
Eiffage SA, Engie SA, Ferrovial SA, Firstgroup PLC, Flughafen Zurich AG, Fraport AG, Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide,
National Grid PLC, Stagecoach Group PLC and Vinci SA.

The performance of these companies has been measured using three performance indicators: revenue, the total return on
equity (Total Shareholder Return) and net profit or loss. The results of these three indicators were compared over three
years with changes in the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Groupe Eurotunnel SE, given
however, that for this second study, to take the method used by some analysts, the instruments granted in the long-term
compensation are only taken into account at the time they are vested, that is to say, when all the performance conditions
related to the instruments have been met. Thus, for option plans, the value of options granted to executive officers was
assessed when they may be exercised, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.

This analysis showed a correlation coefficient of 0.64 of the total remuneration of Jacques Gounon for the Group compared
to an optimal alignment measurement of one.

**_5.1.4 TOTAL AMOUNT SET ASIDE OR OTHERWISE RECOGNISED BY GET SE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY_**

**_FOR PENSIONS, RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFITS_**

Jacques Gounon and François Gauthey do not benefit from any specific retirement benefits.

Jacques Gounon benefits, with respect to the French part of his remuneration, from the

Non-executive directors do not receive any other form of remuneration.

Executive officers and senior management do not receive attendance fees for their appointments in other companies in
the Group.

In addition, the non-executive members of the Board of GET SE benefit from directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, as
do executive officers who are individuals.

**_5.4.2 REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE_**

As stated in chapter 6 of this Registration Document, the Getlink remuneration policy is based on fair and transparent
remuneration to ensure complete consistency between individual goals and business objectives. Getlink’s strategy is also
to share its success with its employees in order to involve them in the Group’s growth. The Group’s remuneration policy
aims to promote the achievement of economic, social and market performance, enhance the growth of skills, meet and
outperform objectives and increase the commitment of employees and managers in the long term, while strengthening
employee ownership.

The members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee ensure consistency between the policy applied to executive
officers and that applied to the senior managers of the Group. The members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee
also examine the alignment of the managers’ remuneration principles.

The remuneration of the Chief Operating Officers is made up of fixed annual remuneration supplemented by an incentivising
variable part, the criteria for which are largely based on the Group’s economic performance, as is the case with the variable
remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer. The variable financial part is
accompanied by qualitative criteria to assess individual performance.

The members of the Executive Committee also receive remuneration made up of a fixed part, the amount of which is
proportional to each one’s responsibilities, supplemented by a variable part whose quantitative criteria depend on the
Group’s results in order to improve the sense of solidarity.

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

**6.1** **OVERVIEW OF GETLINK’S APPROACH TO CSR**

**_6.1.1 ORIGIN OF GETLINK’S COMMITMENT AND APPROACH TO CSR_**

**Group’s history and commitments**

From the very beginning, as an innovative rail company and responsible infrastructure manager Getlink has adopted a social
responsibility policy that seeks to reconcile financial performance, social equity and environmental protection all within a
framework of continuous improvement.

Social responsibility is at the heart of Getlink’s operations and its interactions with its various internal and external
stakeholders, thereby clearly demonstrating its commitment to its partners, such as its employees, customers, suppliers,
shareholders and investors as well as regional government bodies, local authorities, associations and communities.

**Overview of the CSR policy**

The Group has set up a formal CSR policy, supported and sustained at the highest level of the organisation by the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer and the Board. This policy, which entered into force in 2015, dictates the Group’s principles,
challenges and commitments. The CSR objectives are defined each year and are included in the objectives assigned to the
directors and the heads of the various entities of the Group.

True to its principles, for over twenty years the Group has implemented a policy that is both demanding and concrete in
three main areas that represent the strategic priorities of its business:

**_People, i.e. each of the 3,400 Group employees;_**

**_Region, i.e. all communities the Group is connected to everywhere in France, in the UK and in Europe;_**

**_Nature, i.e. the environment and ecosystems with which its growing operations interact._**

Getlink’s CSR policy is in line with the observance of fundamental rights as defined in the major international principles –
the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the
International Labour Organization, OECD guidelines for multinational companies and the principles of the United Nations
Global Compact.

As a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, the Group communicates annually on its Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) best practices within a “Communication on Progress” (COP) report. In 2017, this Group report was
classified at the highest Global Compact level (GC Advanced), thereby placing Getlink amongst the 84 French companies
that reached this classification in 2017 out of more than one thousand signatories in France. The Group supports, adheres
to and actively participates in the World Forum for a Responsible Economy and the values it promotes.

**Scope**

As indicated in section 6.7 (methodological note) of this Registration Document, consolidation of the 2017 data covers all
entities of the Group except ElecLink in respect of environmental data.

**_6.1.2 MATERIALITY AND DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS_**

Group teams listen to their stakeholders in each of their respective areas and primarily to their clients in order to match their
expectations and the Group’s long-term goals. Constructive dialogue based on trust is clearly established with the various
stakeholders. To go even further, the Group seeks to formalise the results of this dialogue at different levels of its
organisation. After conducting a materiality analysis in 2015, aimed at identifying its most significant ethical, social or
environmental challenges, both internal and external to the company, the Group intends to take stock of the state of its
various public CSR communications in 2018 to assess to what extent they meet the recommendations in respect of
“integrated reporting”.

**Methodology**

The materiality analysis consisted of identifying and ranking the main CSR challenges, based on its operations and its
stakeholders’ expectations. This analysis was verified by KPMG in three main steps:

Step 1 – Identification: 57 challenges were identified through an internal and external documentary review of the Group
(Group’s publications and publications by companies in the same sector, analysis of media coverage, and benchmarks).

Step 2 – Assessment by the stakeholders: 25 internal and external stakeholders were polled by an independent third
party based on a questionnaire. The top 25 CSR challenges were identified.

Step 3 – Prioritising challenges: This is represented as a materiality matrix that reflects the importance given by the
respondent stakeholders and the impact that each challenge has on the Group’s business.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

**Results**

By establishing this ranking, the analysis identified a list of challenges arranged in their order of priority (top priority, very
important, important):

CHALLENGES 1 Development of the business activity Safety and security of sites

2 Development of the business activity Efficiency and reliability of equipment and infrastructures

3 Investing in our employees Employee safety

4 Development of the business activity Safety of travellers and goods

5 Environmental performance General policy governing environmental management

The Group assessed all the policies, procedures and means adopted for each of the challenges in order to determine the
actions to be conducted to consolidate or step up its performance, as part of a continuous improvement process.

This procedure highlighted the primary values of the Group according to its stakeholders: safety and security, service,
employees, environment, innovation.

**_6.1.3 MAIN DIMENSIONS OF THE CSR POLICY AND 2017 HIGHLIGHTS_**

The table below illustrates the most material challenges for the Group in each of its three areas of responsibility, as identified
by the materiality analysis, and shows the key events for 2017:

**_6.1.4 POLICY STEERING AND ORGANISATION_**

**Governance – Board**

The Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee of the Board examines the environmental objectives of the company
or the Group and reports its findings to the Board. The Committee is responsible for regularly examining the performance of
GET SE and the Group in environmental matters and the strategic initiatives designed to promote environmental
management, preserve natural resources and limit the impact of GET SE’s and the Group’s activities on the environment.

The work undertaken by the Committee is described in chapter 4 of this Registration Document. The Committee oversees
the establishment of the Group’s CSR policy and sets environmental priorities, structured around the themes included in the
global CSR policy. In view of the ethical importance of CSR, the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee has
been merged with the Ethical and Governance Committee to form a single committee namely the Corporate Committee.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

**Remuneration**

For 2017, the Remuneration Committee maintained the composite CSR performance index: stringent, stable, pertinent and
balanced, this index is structured around four areas that are directly linked to the Group’s activities: safety / security, labour
relations, greenhouse gas emissions and customer satisfaction. For each of these areas, indicators and targets were
established so as to calculate an achievement rate with respect to the composite index, according to the objectives set for
each area. This index is used to calculate 10% of the annual variable remuneration of the Chairman and CEO and 10% of
the free shares plans subject to performance conditions. The composite index was audited in 2017, as part of the audit of
social information by the statutory auditors.

**_6.1.5 REPORTING METHODS AND DATA CERTIFICATION_**

The Group’s social and environmental reporting is based on the labour and environmental information stipulated in
article 225 of French law 2010-788 of 12 July 2010, known as “Grenelle 2”, and on the transparency principles of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI). Following the materiality analysis that was carried out, the challenges deemed as the most
material by the internal and external stakeholders were also identified as such by the Group.

**_6.1.6 INDICES AND AWARDS_**

**Indices**

In 2017, Getlink was included in the following sustainable development indices:

The Deutsche Boerse STOXX Global ESG Leaders family of indices, in particular EURO STOXX Sustainability and
Stoxx Europe Sustainability;

The Gaia Index, the ISR index for midcaps developed by IDMidCaps and EthiFinance for the sixth year running;

The Euronext Low Carbon 100 Europe[®] index: in December 2015, the Group entered the new version of the Low Carbon
100 Europe[®] index that measures the performance of the 100 largest European companies with the lowest CO2 emission
levels in their respective business sectors. The selection is based on an in-depth and accurate assessment of the carbon
footprint of each company and is overseen by a scientific committee composed of experts, NGOs, public partners and
financial sectors;

The FTSE4Good index, included following the update in September 2014: the FTSE4Good index measures the
performance of companies whose commitment to the environmental, social and corporate social responsibility (CSR)
fields is significant.

In this respect, Groupe Eurotunnel SE is regularly monitored by several non-financial rating agencies.

**Awards**

In 2017, the Group won the following awards:

Silver trophy in the Dynamic Governance category at the 14[th] Grand Prix du Gouvernance d’Entrerprise (annual
corporate governance awards) organised by AGEFI, a French economic and financial trade journal.

Green Flag Award: for the 13[th] year running, the Group received the green flag in recognition of its accomplishments in
safeguarding the environment at Samphire Hoe, a natural reserve in England that is home to many rare species of fauna
and flora. The Group in collaboration with White Cliffs Countryside Partnership jointly manages Samphire Hoe which
welcomes over 80,000 visitors each year.

Gold level award granted to the Europorte subsidiary Socorail by Eco Vadis. This is awarded to the top 5% of companies
noted for their commitment to CSR.

**6.2** **PEOPLE**

**Overview of the Group policy**

As a responsible employer, the Group seeks to promote the personal development and fulfilment of its employees, which it
considers a key factor in its corporate strategy. Its human resources policies have been developed in order to foster equal
opportunities and treatment for all Group employees throughout their career.

These human resources policies recognise each employee’s contribution, taking account of the employee’s qualifications,
level of responsibility and individual performance.

The Group staff members who work for the Fixed Link in the United Kingdom are employees of ESL and in France, Germany,
the Netherlands and Spain they are employees of ESGIE. Employees involved in rail freight transport and port infrastructure
management activities are employed by the entities of the Europorte segment. ElecLink has recruited the necessary team
for the interconnector project between France and the UK.

Staff may also be seconded to other Group companies. The company who acts as employer bills the other Group companies
for their respective staff costs. The Group’s senior managers are mostly employed by GET SE.

**The most material challenges**

The Group’s commitment is focused on the challenges that have been deemed the most material in the materiality analysis:

Safety of employees, travellers, goods and sites, as well as the efficiency and reliability of the equipment and
infrastructures;


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Well-being at work and work-life balance;

Implementation of efficient forms of dialogue with employees;

Working conditions;

Employment and development of appeal.

**_6.2.1 HEALTH AND SAFETY_**

**Group policy and challenges**

Site safety and security, safety of employees, travellers and goods, as well as the efficiency and reliability of equipment and
infrastructures were identified by the Group’s stakeholders during the materiality analysis as being the priority challenges
for the Group. Several mechanisms and procedures, which are reinforced on a regular basis, are used within the Group and
its entities to ensure and reinforce work safety and security:

The Group defines security as protection against external risks, resulting more specifically from deliberate,
malicious acts;

Safety involves the protection against risks arising from faults, damage, errors and hazards, of a physical, emotional or
psychological nature, etc.

For the Group, health is a comprehensive state of physical, mental and social well-being that is promoted in the company
by monitoring employees, listening to them and conducting preventive actions with the department of occupational health
(monitoring of aptitudes, interviews with medical staff, psychological help, vaccination campaigns, improvement of working
conditions, recognising hardship, etc.).

Performance in matters of safety is monitored regularly as part of the continuous improvement process with appropriate
corrective actions taken as needed. The Group has adopted policies and procedures to ensure the health, safety and
well-being of its staff (SAFD – health and safety and OENV – operating environment).

Security was at the heart of the Fixed Link design. The transport system has a level of safety recognised as good, reinforced
by feedback received since the beginning of operations. The health and safety measures put in place by the Group ensure
that employees are guaranteed work conditions in accordance with the legislation in force in each of its locations and the
human resources policies of each subsidiary.

In order to test response plans for the emergency services and good coordination in the event of an accident in the Tunnel,
the Group and the public authorities organise an annual major full-scale safety exercise: the Binat (as in binational). Held in
January 2018, the latest Binat was the 28[th] since the construction of the Tunnel and the 21[st] since the opening of commercial
services in 1994. France was the pilot State this year for the purposes of the exercise.

The Group places great importance on reinforcing appropriate behaviour and so has established a set of procedures to
ensure that the infrastructure and equipment are used efficiently. Effective management of these risk areas provides the
foundation for overall safety performance.

Like safety, health has always been a major concern for the Group. Its policy in this area is based on transparency, discipline
and discussion at all levels in the company. It is communicated to everyone and reviewed regularly.

In France, a charter on the handling of work-related psychosocial risks has been in force since April 2009 for ESGIE
employees. This establishes the procedure adopted by the company to deal with cases of problems at work. In keeping with
this charter, a commission was set up to anticipate and address work-related psychosocial risks and a psychological unit
was created in July 2015 with the members of the CHSCT (the health, hygiene, security and working conditions committee).
The commission meets quarterly with an associated plan of action. In July 2015, ESGIE also signed a company agreement
on the gift of rest days to parents of seriously ill children, which agreement was extended to cover spouses and co-workers
who are seriously ill, isolated and vulnerable.

**Actions and means implemented**

_Organisation_

Within the Board, the Safety and Security Committee ensures that mechanisms and procedures designed to ensure the
safety of customers, employees, subcontractors and all stakeholders are implemented. The actions and responsibilities of
this Committee are described in section 4.2.5 of this Registration Document. Additionally, each segment of the Group has
its own safety and sustainable development department whose main task is to define the company’s safety objectives and
to guarantee the implementation and application of all the safety rules. It is also responsible for measuring performance
within the various departments, with the objective of maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. Safety performance
is regularly monitored by each of the entities as part of a programme for continuous improvement and any corrective actions
are taken as necessary.

The main security expenditure (to ensure System security) in 2017 totalled a net amount of approximately €19 million (€19
million in 2016 and €29 million in 2015) for the Fixed Link.

_Safety of facilities_

The safety management system of Europorte’s French entities licensed as rail companies is governed by the legislation of
the different countries in which they operate.

The operating system for the Shuttle was designed under the supervision of the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) and
the Safety Authority. Each phase of the initial design was examined by the IGC and formally acknowledged by way of a
no-objection statement.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

The IGC and the Safety Authority, which were created under the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession agreement, are
charged with supervising the construction and operation of the System on behalf of the United Kingdom and France. In
addition, audits and inspections are carried out by representatives of the French and British Safety Committee delegations.

Safety features and procedures are updated regularly and are part of the Safety Management System, which ensures the
validity of the operating certificate issued by IGC, in accordance with laws and regulations resulting from the enactment of
the European Union’s Railway Safety Directive 2004/49/EC of 29 April 2004.

More generally, the System has detailed safety, security and policing features meeting the requirements of the
United Kingdom and French authorities. These measures have been reinforced in the geopolitical context of the past two
years, as indicated in chapter 3 of this Registration Document.

Safety and security measures for High-Speed Passenger Trains and for Train Operators Rail Freight Services have been
developed by the operators after discussion with, and with the approval of, the United Kingdom and France. The Train
Operators work with the Group as the infrastructure manager to implement and continuously improve these safety measures.
Automated passport control incorporating facial recognition technology is operational for the Eurostar departing from the
Gare du Nord in Paris[14]. Identical systems have been used at St Pancras station in London since June 2016. These systems
check the traveller’s identity using facial recognition. After London and Paris, Eurostar plans to install the same systems at
the Brussels Midi station.

In the course of 2016, the IGC transferred its economic regulation authority to two regulators in France and the
United Kingdom (ARAFER and ORR). Checks and terms of operation of the Railway Companies are now overseen by
ARAFER and ORR.

_Safety, the highest priority for the Fixed Link_

The Channel Tunnel has a team of 48 rescue mission specialists who patrol the service tunnel round the clock. Since 2011,
four SAFE stations are operational in the intervals in the centre of the Tunnel so that in the event of a fire on a Truck Shuttle,
the 800 metre-long train can rapidly reach one of these stations. The Channel Tunnel is the only infrastructure of its type in
the world equipped with a system of this kind.

_Site safety_

Intrusion attempts at the Coquelles site (Hauts-de-France) decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015, thanks in
particular to the setting up by the Group of an important programme with the support of the French and British states,
responsible for border control. This multi-year action plan is described in section 1.6.2 of this Registration Document.

_Health and safety in the workplace_

All safety events are recorded and analysed in order to issue recommendations and produce action plans. Additionally,
various safety indicators are monitored continuously and systematically, notably by the Safety and Security Committee at
Board level, in order to ensure improved overall performance. This is particularly true for the indicators concerning the safety
of employees and subcontractors and the transportation system.

Prominence is also given to feedback that is implemented routinely in the Group’s subsidiaries after an exercise or following
a significant event. This feedback allows the integration of lessons learned and contributes to the effective development of
organisational methods, with a view to making them more efficient.

The Group takes special care to ensure that its safety and security rules and procedures are enforced by its subcontractors
who are required to sign a contractual agreement on compliance with labour laws and regulations. While on a Group
subsidiary site, subcontractors are required to adhere to the same rules as the Group’s employees. They also have to
undergo safety training before they are authorised to enter a Group site or the site of one of the Group’s customers.
Moreover, subcontractors are submitted to audits and to on-site monitoring. Socorail sends accreditation questionnaires and
annual evaluations to its subcontractors, as well as the policy and objectives of the organisation in relation to the health and
safety of subcontractors. If there is a safety breach, corrective actions are put in place; these can be accompanied by
warnings, penalties, suspensions of operations or by exclusion. Despite these efforts and vigilance, the risk of an accident
cannot be totally avoided, as stated in section 3.1.2 of this Registration Document.

Each subsidiary deploys procedures and action programmes to limit and prevent the major risks inherent to the activities of
its employees and to improve their quality of life in the workplace.

_A committee dedicated to improving working conditions_

In France, committees on hygiene, safety and working conditions (CHSCT) are set up and tasked with ensuring the
protection of the health and safety of employees, and the improvement of their working conditions. This committee, that is
comprised notably of staff representatives, analyses occupational risk and ensures – through means including surveys and
inspections – compliance with the regulations in place. It is consulted prior to any major modification to working conditions.

In the United Kingdom, the occupational health service plays a key role in preventing occupational illnesses through the
education and the promotion of health issues, and through the suitable control measures that are set up to improve working
conditions. Composed of representatives of employees and company managers, the committee aims to promote safety at
work and improve working conditions.

From a medical standpoint, employees have regular medical check-ups with occupational healthcare professionals and can
request a medical examination independently of these check-ups. For ESGIE in France and ESL in the United Kingdom, the
Group has an occupational healthcare service staffed by an occupational health doctor and two nurses to take care of
employees’ health.

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

In 2017, Getlink also continued its actions promoting health and safety by conducting awareness-raising and training
sessions for its employees:

Europorte organised its 6th Safety Week, on the theme of “Behaviour and human factors”. In 2017, Europorte’s CODIR
carried out more than 60 site visits throughout France, during which fruitful discussions took place on staff safety,
incidents linked to a lack of compliance with procedures and to significant incidents.

An awareness-raising campaign, entitled “Safety takes to the screen”, was launched by the general management of the
Fixed Link in 2016 and continued in 2017. Based on short-format videos broadcast on the corporate intranet, this
campaign aims to achieve greater awareness of safety issues and to promote and share best practices. The Fixed Link
organised several other events in 2017:

   - the mobilisation of managers with a very strong presence on the ground (up 75%);

   - exchanges between suppliers and staff to share safety knowhow;

   - automated monthly safety reporting implemented;

   - a mobile app to collect safety incidents.

In 2017, the Group recorded a decrease in the frequency of work-related accidents to 7.4 (compared with 8.6 in 2016 and
11.0 in 2015).

Also, in France, 17 applications requesting the recognition of occupational disease were recorded (16 files for ESGIE and
one for Socorail), during 2017. Most of the requests concerned musculo-skeletal problems.

The Group had no fatal employee accidents in 2017.

**_6.2.2 WORKING CONDITIONS_**

**Group policy and challenges**

In accordance with its Global Compact commitments, Groupe Eurotunnel SE is committed to preventing any forms of modern
slavery, human trafficking or child labour within its business and supply chain. Its policies and procedures reflect its aim to
act ethically and with integrity in all its business relationships.

As regards work time organisation, the Group policy is based on the compromise sought between two major priorities: the
determination to satisfy and best serve the company’s customers, and the need to maintain a balance between its
employees’ work and family lives.

The Group’s policy is driven by a flexible and responsive approach that enables the company – in particular the Fixed Link –
to operate 24/7, 365 days of the year under the Concession agreement.

**Actions and means implemented**

Getlink ensures that all its subsidiaries comply with legal and contractual obligations regarding working hours. In the
United Kingdom, the average working week for ESL employees is 37 hours (i.e. 1,924 hours per year) based on individual
contracts and agreements in place with the trade union Unite and the staff representative bodies.

In France, employees’ working hours (with the exception of certain senior managers and directors) must not exceed an
average of 35 hours a week over the year, and in any event, not more than 1,600 hours per year.

The absenteeism rate of 4.5% in 2017 is comparable to 2016. The main cause of absenteeism is sickness other than
occupational disease.

However, efforts are being made by the Group's subsidiaries to reduce absenteeism. A follow-up of sick leave is carried out
by the Human Resources Department, which has established processes including return to work interviews. Action plans
are also developed to draw the attention of staff to the consequences of absenteeism in terms of the disruption to services.

**_6.2.3 DIALOGUE AND LABOUR RELATIONS_**

**Group policy and challenges**

The implementation of efficient forms of dialogue with employees was identified as a highly important challenge in the
materiality analysis. Labour relations are very important for the Group, particularly negotiations with staff representative
bodies. The Group has always strived to establish long-term and constructive relations with all its employees.

**Actions and means implemented**

Getlink has created the following bodies for dialogue with its employees:

**Tasks and working** **Actions in 2017**


Works Councils
Health, hygiene and safety

European Works Council for the
Fixed Link


In France, all subsidiaries have a Works Council and a Health
and Safety Committee, which meet according to the specific
terms of reference governing each committee.
In the United Kingdom, the Company Council and the Safety,
Health and Environment Committee are the 2 organisations
for ESL employees with which permanent dialogue has been
established. These 2 committees meet once every 2 months.

The Fixed Link’s European Works Council, a truly
transnational body, is a venue for information, consultation,
exchange of views and dialogue. The European Works
Council supplements the existing national staff representative
bodies, with its own prerogatives. The Fixed Link’s European
Works Council normally meets twice a year. It is informed
about and, where appropriate, consulted on transnational
issues having an impact on the Fixed Link’s employees.
The Group’s European Works Council is composed of
16 incumbents. It is informed about the economic, financial
and employee-related strategies of the Group.


9 meetings were held during 2017
between ESGIE management and HSC
and 11 with Works Council members.
The Company Council met 6 times in
2017, and the Safety, Health and
Environment Committee met 6 times
during the same year.
6 meetings were held in 2017 between
the ESL management and the trade
union Unite.

No meetings in 2017.

The Committee met twice in 2017 in the
presence of the Group Chairman and
CEO, the Deputy CEO (for the second
meeting) and the Group Head of
Human Resources.


Getlink Group Committee The committee was set up on 31 January 2014 following a
unanimous agreement between the Group’s management and
4 unions. It is intended to operate as a forum for mutual
information, to exchange views and to maintain dialogue
between staff representatives and management on strategic
guidelines and major employee-related issues. To this end, it
is informed annually of the developments that have taken
place and the future outlook.
The Group Committee comprises 6 incumbent staff
representatives and 6 alternate staff representatives
appointed by the labour unions. It is supplemented by a union
representative for each labour union. It meets twice a year in a
plenary session, when convened by the Chairman or the
Chairman’s representative.

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

**Tasks and working** **Actions in 2017**


European Company Committee The staff representatives on the European Company

Committee are employees of Group Eurotunnel SE’s
subsidiaries who are elected or appointed according to the
rules applicable in the country that employs them, for a
four-year period, as from 1 January 2015.
The committee is composed of 12 incumbent staff
representatives and 12 alternate staff representatives who are
elected or appointed according to the rules applicable in the
country that employs them, and is supplemented by a union
representative for each participating labour union that
appointed members to the European Company Committee.
The committee is informed formally prior to any significant
decision relating to the European company’s scope, legal or
financial structures, and the consequences, if any, on
employment.
The committee meets twice a year in an ordinary plenary
session. Extraordinary meetings may be held in the event of
exceptional circumstances that are likely to affect the
employees' interests.


Committee for occupational
health and well-being


The committee was set up in 2015 following the conclusions of
a study performed by an outside firm to assess the workplace
health and well-being of ESGIE employees.
In addition to the CHSCT, this committee is in charge of
considering actions aimed at improving working conditions
and well-being at work, as an observer.


The Committee met twice in the
presence of the Group Chairman and
CEO (for the second meeting), the
Deputy CEO, the Chief Operating
Officer (for the first meeting) and the
Group Head of Human Resources, who
outlined the Group’s operations,
financial results and key events.

The Committee met 5 times in 2017.


_Dialogue and internal communication_

The Group regularly holds meetings with staff representatives and directors which demonstrates the Group’s determination
to reinforce internal communication and social dialogue.

In addition, internal communications are mainly intended to nurture and strengthen the commitment and involvement of all
employees. The Group uses different tools to communicate with and inform these employees (magazine, intranet,
project-specific communications, etc.). The circulation of information relating to the Group strategy, objectives and results
as well as the promotion of achievements and/or innovative initiatives are examples of actions taken to keep the employees
of the Group informed in real time.

In February 2016, Europorte decided to carry out a survey called “Europorte And You”, which it entrusted to an independent
company. The approach enabled the identification of areas for improvement in modes of communication, relations within
the company and life in the workplace. Three areas of progress were identified, in respect of which action was taken in 2017:
supporting mobility, sharing company strategy and promoting communication between services.

**Results of the year**

No labour disputes or strikes disrupted operations in 2017.

_Summary of collective bargaining agreements_

During the 2017 financial year, 12 company-level agreements and/or amendments were signed by the Group’s subsidiaries
on topics such as the right to disconnect, end of career planning and wage negotiations. In France, employees of ESGIE
are represented by four trade unions and covered by a collective bargaining agreement as part of a company-level
agreement. The employees of Europorte subsidiaries are also represented by four unions and come under two collective
bargaining agreements.

The employees of ESGIE come under the collective bargaining agreements mainly relating to the 35-hour work week, night
work, strategic workforce planning, profit-sharing, and professional equality and efficiency gains. Specifically, in 2017,
ESGIE signed four agreements and riders on the right to disconnect, end of career planning, a health scheme and fees, as
well as the mandatory annual pay negotiations. The Europorte subsidiaries entered into eight agreements and/or
amendments in 2017, covering procedures to organise working time, wage negotiations and the time savings account. ESL
entered into no agreements in 2017.

In the United Kingdom, due to the voluntary agreement on single union representation signed in 2000 by ESL with the union
Unite, all employees of ESL (with the exception of supervisory staff) are represented by Unite during collective negotiations.
Employees may nevertheless belong to the union of their choice for their individual representation.

_Company welfare facilities_

In 2017, in France ESGIE paid 0.8% of its gross total wage bill as restated to the Works Council, amounting to €621,048 for
the development and management of its company welfare facilities (compared to €580,702 in 2016). ESGIE also contributed
0.2% of its total gross wage bill, i.e. €155,262, towards the operation of the Works Council (€145,175 in 2016).

In the 2017 financial year, Socorail contributed 0.50% of its gross total wage bill to its Works Council for developing and
managing company welfare facilities, of which 0.20% was for its operation (compared to 0.56% and 0.20% in 2016). In
respect of Europorte France, the figures were 0.42% and 0.20%.

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

In the United Kingdom, the Company Council, which receives contributions from ESL equal to 0.8% of its gross total wage
bill as restated, received £255,962 in 2017 for developing and managing company welfare activities (compared to £243,916
in 2016). ESL also contributed 0.2% of its gross total wage bill, i.e. £63,990, towards the operation of the Company Council
(compared to £60,979 in 2016).

**_6.2.4 EMPLOYMENT_**

**Group policy and challenges**

Getlink pays particular attention to the recruitment and employment of its employees and their remuneration in order to
closely match workforce numbers and skills to its actual business needs.

_Age pyramid_

The Group is continuing its forward management of the age pyramid. For several years it has pursued a recruitment policy
aimed at lowering the age of the workforce at the same time as facilitating the transfer of skills. It is also committed to
promoting the maintenance of employees aged 55 and over in active employment, and to improve the working conditions of
older employees.

_Recruitment_

The recruitment policy aims to equip the Group with the best skills in order to support its development. True to its values,
the Group’s recruitment process places great importance on applicants’ cultural openness, their ability to work as part of a
team, and their entrepreneurial spirit.

_Remuneration_

The Group remuneration policy is based on equitable and transparent remuneration, which ensures full cohesion between
individual and company objectives. Getlink’s strategy consists of sharing its success with its employees and making them a
partner in its growth.

Recognition of individual performance is a major element in the Group’s remuneration policy, and is intended to motivate all
Group’s employees, with a view to rewarding and retaining the most talented. The differences in remuneration between
employees can be justified and reflect the responsibilities shouldered, the work experience and the potential of each person.

_Career management_

The Group is committed to the improvement of its employees’ performance, and considers the individual annual performance
review as an indispensable management tool for human resources management. It therefore fixes the target number of
interviews at 100% for all the managers of the company.

Since 2015, the Group has used a new computer application called Success Factors that centralises the information
gathered from annual performance reviews of the Group’s managerial staff. This tool measures the needs of the different
entities in the short, medium and long term and enables an assessment of the individual and collective potential of human
capital and their deployment, as well, when necessary, the anticipation of the succession process for key jobs. Put in place
to assimilate annual appraisal interview data for managerial staff, Success Factors was extended in 2017 so that it covers
all Fixed Link staff both in France and the United Kingdom and not just managerial staff.

_Employee share ownership and profit-sharing_

The Group has put in place a number of mechanisms related to statutory and non-statutory profit-sharing, stock options and
free shares, which are all systems intended to involve each of the employees in the Group’s financial performance.

_Temporary employment and subcontracting_

The Group employs temporary staff, mainly to replace employees who are absent due to sickness or on leave, or to handle
exceptional traffic peaks. It also relies on subcontractors to manage activities outside its core businesses or those requiring
specific skills.

**Actions and means implemented**

The Group has taken various measures to cope with the risk of mismatch between the development of its activities and the
human resources necessary to implement its strategy.

_Recruitment_

The Group tends to favour permanent work contracts, keen to demonstrate its commitment to its employees over the long
term and guarantee them lasting employment.

Since 2014, Getlink has been working with Réseau Alliances to promote an employment support programme for
new graduates.

_Remuneration_

Under a bonus system, half based on safety and service quality indicators and half on cash flow performance, all Concession
employees are entitled to receive a bonus of up to 6% of annual basic salary.

For four years, the Group’s employees have received a Total Benefits Statement detailing their overall remuneration and all
the benefits they receive (and two years ago it began to be sent in dematerialised form).

_Employee share ownership and profit-sharing_

The Group pursues an active policy of encouraging employee shareholders so that they can share in the company’s success.
Thus, the Board has awarded shares to all employees of GET SE and its related companies or groups (excluding executives


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

and corporate officers of GET SE), as indicated in note E.5 to the consolidated financial statements included in section 2.2.1
of this Registration Document.

In addition, all employees of GET SE’s French subsidiaries have the possibility to invest in ordinary shares in a Group
savings plan via a “Eurotunnel shareholding” Plan Commun de Placement d’Entreprise – PCPE (corporate shareholding
plan). The sums invested in this fund receive a matching contribution within the legal caps in force. At 31 December 2017,
1,755,375 ordinary shares were held under this plan, representing 0.32% of outstanding share capital.

The Group’s employees also receive statutory and non-statutory profit-sharing bonuses. Thus, in France, amendments to
the profit-sharing agreements were put in place within Socorail for the period from 2015 to 2017 and an agreement was put
in place for the period from 2017 to 2019 for Europorte SAS. For 2017, ESGIE staff received a profit-sharing bonus of €2,010.

Although the French statutory profit-sharing scheme is not transposable to the United Kingdom, employees of ESL
nevertheless benefit from a collective bonus scheme that resulted in the payment of £923 per ESL employee in 2017
(£1,035 in 2016). During the 2017 wage negotiations, a supplementary bonus of £600 per employee was agreed by way of
adjustment to the 2016 bonus.

_Work-study_

Each year, the different entities of the Group offer training opportunities in the form of a work-study programme. Such
agreements have been signed with various secondary schools and universities in the Hauts-de-France region and in the
Paris region.

In this area, Europorte has initiated a collaboration with E2C Grand Lille (second chance school in Lille) to guide unskilled
and unemployed young adults aged 18 to 25 into first-time employment and social inclusion, by providing them with
professionalisation contracts, work-study training or internships.

In 2017, two recruitment sessions for professionalisation contracts were organised between CIFFCO, the French “Pôle
Emploi” and the Group.

The various subsidiaries of the Group also take on trainees, apprentices and young people under professionalisation
contracts. In France, 281 trainees, apprentices and young people under professionalisation contracts joined the Group in
2017. In addition, the Concession welcomed young graduates as part of the International Business Volunteering scheme
that allows French companies to give a young person (up to 28 years old) a professional post abroad.

_Number of employees_ **2017** **2016**

Student apprentices 82 87

Professional training contracts 105 85

Trainees 94 104

 
**Total** **281** **276**

As a part of its commitment and active involvement to promote the employability of young people, in 2017 the Group
participated in several forums dedicated to recruitment to introduce its line of business and propose jobs or internships
(the “Jeunes d’Avenirs” fair, the “Job d’Avenirs” forum, the seventh edition of Cross-border job fair at Fréthun, and the salon
“Permis Sport Emplois” organised by FACE in the Calais area).

_Diversity and equal opportunity_

The Group has openly taken a stance in fighting discrimination, by its Charter of Ethics and Behaviour and through fair
human resources policies for recruitment, remuneration and training. Moreover, the Group is a signatory of the United
Nations Global Compact, and fully adheres to its ten fundamental principles, notably those relating to Human Rights and
Rights at Work. The Group’s human resources policies are also geared towards combating discrimination, and are designed
to guarantee equal treatment and opportunities for all employees at every stage of their career. The Group never bases its
decisions on criteria linked to gender, nationality, religion, ethnic origin, political opinions or union activities. The only valid
decision-making criteria for the Group are each employee’s professional qualities, qualifications and skills.

Professional equality between men and women is a particularly important lever in the Group’s diversity policy. Its adherence
to the principles of gender equality is reflected in the application of an equal opportunities policy in recruitment, access to
training, remuneration and promotion. The human resources policies of every Group entity are based on the inviolable
principle of gender equality, and the Charter of Ethics and Behaviour addressed to all Group employees describes the
principles that must govern the behaviour of every employee in relation to respect for people, of which the principle of
non-discrimination is one of the most important.

Disability is another important aspect of the Group’s diversity policy, which supports the first-time employment, professional
training and continued employment of disabled people.

Under its human resources policy, the Group conducts various actions and develops partnerships with economic
stakeholders, the business sector and local players to foster employment. Since 2015, the Group has participated in a
partnership with the “Capital Filles” association that organises mentoring of young girls in technical secondary schools by
female professionals to promote accessibility by women to traditionally male dominated job sectors. In 2017, 6 sponsorships
of this kind were established at the Calais secondary school, Lycée Léonard de Vinci.

An agreement on professional equality to do away with wage gaps between men and women was signed in June 2009 by
ESGIE with the trade unions for an indefinite period.

In the United Kingdom, the Rate for the Job remuneration system and the HAY method (that notably measures the extent
of the responsibilities entrusted and the difficulty inherent to them) ensures fair remuneration for ESL employees.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Together with its actions to promote the continued employment of disabled people, the Group works hand in hand with the
sheltered and supported sectors by using employment agencies for disabled workers and/or supported job centres. An
ongoing agreement was concluded in 2010 for the benefit of disabled workers with AFAPEI (a French association for parents
and friends of children with developmental needs) and ESGIE. On 23 July 2013, a partnership framework agreement was
signed between the Group and APF (the French association for people suffering from paralysis) in which the Group
undertook to approach APF for any service falling within its areas of competence. ESGIE approached APF several times in
connection with this partnership, for various services. Through this collaboration, four persons have been provided with
permanent, full-time employment.

As in 2016, the Group conducted several awareness-raising actions in 2017 within the Group on disability with the
specialised company “Made in TH”, by appointing a dedicated ambassador, setting up a monthly consultation session on
site, conducting interviews and setting up support measures. In addition, a training program was set up within the framework
of a partnership between the Group and a temporary employment agency specialising in helping disabled people. At the
same time, another action was carried out with the Direccte of the Hauts-de-France, which allowed the placement of a
handicapped worker for a one-year service contract. Europorte signed a contract for the cleaning of work clothes with an
ESAT organisation helping people back to work in the North-West region. This option will be considered when renewing
contracts in other regions.

**Results of the year**

During the year, the Group experienced an increase of close to 2% in its workforce compared to 2016. This trend is mainly
concentrated in the Fixed Link with an increase of close to 4%.

_Remuneration_

In France, all employees received a collective increase in basic salary and of all allowance payments linked to working
conditions from 1 January 2018, representing 1.3% for ESGIE staff, 1% for Socorail staff, 1% for EPP staff, 1.2% for EPF
staff and 0.3% for Europorte SAS staff.

In the United Kingdom, a 2.4% collective increase to pay and allowance payments linked to working conditions was
negotiated by the management and the trade union Unite for ESL from 1 April 2017.

For 2017, the results of the Fixed Link (ESGIE and ESL) translated into an operating bonus of 1.38% and a financial bonus
of 0.72%, representing a general bonus of 2.10%. A management bonus is also paid to management staff, equal to a salary
percentage that changes with the management level.

In France, the employment rate for disabled workers in 2017 for ESGIE, EPF and Socorail, calculated on the basis of the
data contained in the mandatory annual declaration of employment submitted to the AGEFIPH (French national association
responsible for managing the fund for disabled employees), is 3.37%, 0.69%, and 0.79%, (2016: 4.06%, 0.75%, and 0.69%,
respectively and 2015: 3.73%, 0.45%, and 0.92%).

While data cannot be gathered for this indicator in the United Kingdom as there is no specific “disabled worker” status, the
British entities of the Group, like all the Group, are nevertheless bound by the same commitments and the fundamental
principles of the Group’s Charter of Ethics and Behaviour as concerns equality. Also, they implement an equal opportunities
policy intended to ensure that all employees are treated identically, as in the French subsidiaries.

**_6.2.5 TRAINING_**

**Group policy and challenges**

The Group, which operates in highly technical business segments, has always placed training at the forefront of its concerns.

The main focus of the Group’s training policy is to strengthen the key competencies of its employees and to maintain a high
level of operational performance within teams, enabling them to contribute to the development of the business. Emphasising
a common culture in the areas of safety, security and the environment and improving the adaptation of employees to their
job position are key priorities.

**Actions and means implemented**

CIFFCO, with its training centre, manages both the training plan and the training for the Concession, as well as supporting
the development of the rail freight industry and local train operators. It provides dedicated training programmes with a focus
on rail-related activities in the national Railways and other networks, as described in section 6.3.2 of this Registration

**Overview of the Group’s policy**

Corporate social commitment is deeply ingrained in the Group’s history and culture. The Group seeks to establish close ties
with all the communities that it interacts with – customers, local authorities, economic partners – in France, in Great Britain
and in Europe.

**Recap of the biggest challenges**

The Group’s commitment is focused on the most pressing challenges as indicated in the materiality analysis:

Customer satisfaction and loyalty-building;

Expansion of the railways and in particular, the links with national and European regulations;

Development of local employment and the local economy.

**_6.3.1 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND LOYALTY-BUILDING_**

**Group policy and challenges**

The materiality analysis placed customer satisfaction and loyalty-building, as well as the management of traffic, capacity
and railway path availability among the very important challenges for the Group. Free movement of goods and people are
included in the important challenges.

The Group has placed customer care at the heart of its development strategy. For the staff in all of its subsidiaries, safety
and quality of service are a priority as well as a daily and strategic requirement. Deeply rooted in a binational and
customer-centric culture, the Group invests continuously in adapting its services, in quality care to customers, punctuality,
smooth operation, comfort and safety, hinging on a central goal: to constantly expand the high-level quality of service which
is the foundation for its economic growth.

**Actions and means implemented**

As described in section 1.6.2 of this Registration Document, the Group has deployed various actions to respond to the
expectations of its customers (passenger buildings, Flexiplus) and to increase capacity (three new Truck Shuttles,
programme to extend the terminals at Coquelles and Folkestone, etc.). The Group has adopted an ambitious digital plan,
with a view to making its exchanges with customers, employees and partners even more fluid and personal in the interests
of improving the customer experience. Built around the Group's customers, employees and partners, this strategic plan aims
to integrate and rethink the place of digitalisation throughout the customer journey, improve the offer to customers and
continue its development.

Europorte’s sales policy seeks to transform the traditional approach of the rail transport sector based on short-term traffic
into structured medium-term partnerships.

**_6.3.2 PROMOTION OF RAIL TRANSPORTATION_**

**Group policy and challenges**

The Group’s dependence on national and European railway regulations was identified as a very important challenge by the
materiality analysis. As world leader in rolling motorway and piggyback transport, Getlink campaigns for the use of railways
to leverage the development of regions, as indicated in section 1.2.2.b) of this Registration Document, while keeping the
environmental impact low.

**Actions and means implemented**

_Vocational training in the rail industry_

CIFFCO, the first private training centre dedicated to rail industry professions, was created in 2011 and is 100% owned by
the Group. CIFFCO offers its services to all rail operators, infrastructure maintenance companies and industrial concerns
for the training of their staff.

CIFFCO has:

a Franco-British team with expertise in railway training;

a building entirely devoted to training;

14 modern and efficient micro-simulators essential for the training of train drivers;

a new platform for distance learning;

the necessary approvals to operate as a railway training centre; CIFFCO is certified by Établissement Public de Sécurité
Ferroviaire (EPSF, a public rail safety association) to provide train safety training on the French national rail network.
The train driver training of CIFFCO is listed in the French national directory of professional certifications, as well as the
training of ground staff. It can award a professional qualification recognised by the French State. CIFFCO is therefore
today the first, and only, private training organisation authorised to offer these qualifications, in addition to the French
public operator.

On 5 December 2017, EPSF invited the CEO of CIFFCO to present the training centre’s actions and vision relating to the
digital transformation applied to training.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

CIFFCO has also invested in a partnership with the Association Activer des solutions pour le Fret Ferroviaire, 2A2F, which
promotes rail freight, and so emphasises CIFFCO‘s attraction for logistics professionals.

In 2017, CIFFCO provided a total of 4,989 railways training days for 419 people from all over France but also from Belgium,
Switzerland and Italy (Group employees and outside companies). In total, since the opening of the centre, 272 ground staff
and nearly 550 trainee train drivers have been trained, with half of the training provided to companies outside the Group.

During the year, the training mainly concerned drivers of service and works trains on the French railway network, as well as
ground and maintenance staff. CIFFCO contributes to creating skilled jobs and promoting employability. It also is a key
driver in the development of railway transport and of its related jobs and, more generally, is involved in the economic
development and the enhanced influence of the Hauts-de-France region. In 2017, CIFFCO and ESGIE along with other
partners, arranged a seven week training course for disabled job seekers.

As part of its strong commitment to young people, the Group develops its relations with universities and schools in order to
promote better knowledge of the jobs it offers and help young people enter the world of employment:

Training diploma in railway engineering and maintenance professions set up and developed by Europorte in close
collaboration with the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers;

Agreement with the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées engineering school to establish an education and research
“Railway transport sciences” chair dedicated to the study of railway activity, until the year 2018. The aim of this chair is
training and research on the topics associated with infrastructure and transport services. This initiative attests to the
Group’s willingness to share its expertise in order to advance science and innovation, and to position the railway industry
as a profession of the future;

Partnerships with the Institut Catholique des Arts et Métiers (ICAM) and the Institut d’Administration des Entreprises
(IAE), two Lille institutions, in order to develop a new approach to the maintenance trade;

Participation in November 2017 in the “Professeurs en entreprises” operation initiated by Fondation C Génial, a
foundation for scientific and technical culture. This operation is aimed at teachers (and other members of the national
education system) at the secondary level and, in addition to the professional integration of young people, it makes it
possible to promote the sectors and the scientific and technical professions of the companies visited. Several managers
of the Fixed Link rolling stock were deployed in support of this activity.

**Group partnerships for the development of the railways**

The Group offers its expertise in managing transport infrastructures and rail activities to various public bodies at European,
national and regional levels.

The Group also contributes to the work of the European Committee for Standardisation as part of the working group
responsible for drafting a proposed standard for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of transport services.

The Group is a founding member of the Fer de France association which was created in 2012 to bring together the leading
players in the French railway industry. The work presided over by the Group led to proposals for the French State to
recognise different professions in this developing sector.

The Group is also an active member of I-Trans, the global competitiveness cluster and the reference cluster for railways in
France. The Group’s Human Resources Director participates as the controller in the CAPFOR (training project management
and coordination circle) operational group that aims to make existing training more consistent with the industry’s
expectations, creating a pool of expertise in the region and developing high-quality higher education with international
influence.

**_6.3.3 REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT_**

**Group policy and challenges**

The development of local employment and the local economy are listed among the important challenges in the materiality
analysis.

Getlink has carved a niche for itself in its environment and has shaped that environment in a positive manner. As an
employer, it participates directly and actively in local economic development, and pursues its mission as developer in
consultation with stakeholders. As a committed partner in its economic and social environment, the Group has always been
a leading economic player and local employer. Its mission is fully in line with ensuring that it is rooted in the regions in which
it operates.

The Group considers its commitment to regional matters to be crucial, especially as it contributes to improving the overall
performance of the company, internal climate and social cohesion, and to enhancing employee loyalty.

To meet these challenges, the Group endeavours to establish links with all the local communities by providing active support
to the associations, schools, universities and organisations with which it works closely on both sides of the Fixed Link. This
commitment notably relies on its dialogue with all its stakeholders.

The decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, which will take effect officially on 29 March 2019,
represents a significant challenge for the Group. The economic consequences for the Group and the risks arising from Brexit
(as set out in section 3.1.1 of this Registration Document) will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the parties.

_Development of local employment_

For over 20 years now, the Tunnel has been a vital link between Great Britain and continental Europe. Since the Tunnel
came into operation, it has created more than 8,000 direct and indirect jobs in the Kent and Hauts-de-France regions, and
has led to the building of large-scale associated infrastructure, including new motorways, high-speed railway lines and
international railway stations.

As indicated in section 1.1.4 of this Registration Document, EY has published a report evaluating the economic contribution
of the Tunnel to trade and tourism and its role in the economic growth of the United Kingdom. Pursuant to the regeneration
agreement signed in 2006 with the French State, Getlink continues to contribute financially and through its expertise to
Calais Promotion, the development agency for the Calais area. This contribution is earmarked primarily for supporting job
creation. Similarly, the Group provides financial support and actively participates in the cross-border job fair Jobs Frontaliers,
a local initiative that facilitates the professional mobility of young people between France, the United Kingdom and Belgium.

Through its commitment to Fondation Agir Contre l’Exclusion (FACE), which provides assistance to those most in need, the
Group encourages its employees to get involved in and initiate humanitarian and charity projects. Several part-time work
contracts have been signed since 2013 between the subsidiary ESGIE and persons assisted by FACE Calais.

Other subcontracting and service partnerships were signed between ESGIE and local companies to develop employment
and guarantee a community foothold for the Group’s activities. These partnerships represented about 1,530 full time
equivalent positions in 2017 for various work including services.

_Development of the local economy_

In connection with its role as a developer, the Group, through its subsidiary Euro-Immo GET, was chosen in January 2013
by the municipality of Sangatte Blériot Plage to develop the seaside eco-village and golf resort project at Porte des
Deux Caps. This project will involve building an international-standard golf course, a luxury hotel, and an eco-friendly
residential development of 500 housing units.

The Group’s land reserves at Coquelles (Pas-de-Calais) were gradually transformed into a 700-hectare Zone
d’Aménagement Concertée (ZAC or mixed development zone) that now includes a shopping centre drawing 6 million visitors
per year on average.

In France, the Europorte companies as a whole are developing their rail freight haulage activities, which enable disused
marshalling yards and railway lines, as well as lines with restricted traffic, to continue operating or to be brought back into
service. However, without political will on the part of the bodies responsible for developing transport infrastructure, the
progressive deterioration or eventual disappearance of the feeder networks could have, as described in chapter 3 of this
Registration Document, a major impact on the income of EPF, which obtains an important part of its business from the
transportation of grain.

Under an agreement similar to a public-private partnership, the Group, alongside the French State, the Hauts-de-France
region, the CCI Cote d’Opale, and the urban community of Dunkirk and SNCF Réseau, is financing feasibility studies on the
modernisation of the Fréthun-Calais-Dunkirk railway line, which would involve its electrification and an increase in rail freight
path availability.

_Solidarity actions_

A key player in the natural, economic and human environment, the Group fulfils its social responsibility through concrete
commitments and actions to support the community:

Payment since 2010 of 10% of the land rental income from the wind farm on its Coquelles site to Secours Populaire,
which distributes the payments in the form of “energy vouchers” to families in Pas-de-Calais. Following its expiry, the
partnership agreement between the Group and Secours Populaire, was renewed for two more years (2017-2019).

Active support to the French Second Chance Foundation, a recognised public interest group committed to the
rehabilitation of people who have faced great difficulties in their lives.

The Concession Works Council regularly backs good causes actively supported by colleagues.

_Sponsorship_

The Group financially supports the World Forum for a Responsible Economy in Lille. Launched by the Réseau Alliances,
this organisation aims to promote a responsible global economy, by sharing the best business practices of responsible
companies.

**_6.3.4 BEST BUSINESS PRACTICES: BEING FAIR AND RESPONSIBLE_**

**Group policy and challenges**

The setting up of the Code of Ethics and the responsible purchasing policy were identified as important challenges in the
materiality analysis. The Group is committed to building a climate of trust and fair relations with all of its stakeholders both
inside and outside the Group.

**Actions and means implemented**

_Ethics_

In its Charter of Ethics and Behaviour, approved by the Board in 2013, the Group sets out the common rules regarding
respect for people, fair competition, internal controls and environmental protection.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

The Group operates as a collection of entities in various sectors of activity and geographical areas. These principles and
guidelines for action apply to all the employees of the Group and its subsidiaries, as well as to their subcontractors and
suppliers. Failure to abide by these ethical rules by employees of the Group can lead to disciplinary action.

The Group has strengthened its arrangements to fight corruption, as set out below and in section 3.4.2.

_Relations with suppliers_

The relations between Getlink and its suppliers go beyond the mere purchasing of goods and services. In compliance with
the principles set down by the Charter of Ethics and Behaviour, the ACHA 0019 procedure (professional ethics code) set
out the Group’s ethics standards. These standards not only ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but
beyond legal criteria, they make for the building of a climate of trust in exchanges between Group representatives and third
parties. Each Group buyer or other employee undertakes to abide by the professional ethics code and to seek suppliers
who share these commitments. The tender process is designed to guarantee the fair treatment of suppliers during
consultations.

In representing the Group’s CSR values and engagements, the Procurement Departments of the various entities have taken
actions that, beyond referring to the Group’s Charter of Ethics and Behaviour in all new contracts, require their suppliers to
comply with its fundamental principles and to sign the Compliance Policy (article 23). Article 23.2.1 requires that suppliers
comply with the French regulations on corruption, as well as UK corruption laws, notably the Bribery Act 2010.

The sustainable development aspect is included by the Concessionaires as part of their tendering process for sub-contracted
work on their Fixed Link sites. Subcontractors are required to commit contractually to respecting labour laws and regulations.
Europorte operates mainly on its customers’ sites, so as regards the management of port infrastructure it integrates the port
authorities’ requirements into its own subcontracting contracts.

In January 2012, the Group signed the “Charter for Responsible Supplier Relations”. This charter includes ten commitments
for responsible purchasing, ensuring a genuine partnership between customers and their suppliers with due regard to their
respective rights and obligations. The Group is also a member of steering committees for the “Responsible Supplier
Relations” charter and certification, and has clearly demonstrated its wish to be a part of this certification process, as an
extension of the implementation of the charter’s ten engagements. In addition, the ethics and compliance steering committee
worked on the implementation of a Group anti-corruption policy, approved by the Board Ethics and Governance Committee
and the Board of Directors, which aims to reinforce the dissemination of the rules of conduct which form the foundation of
the Group’s integrity and ethics. Digital anti-corruption training was put in place in 2017. It is available to all staff.

**6.4** **NATURE**

**Overview of the Group policy**

In a world with limited natural resources, companies cannot ensure their continuity without making constant efforts to control
their energy consumption and reduce the impact of their operations on the environment. For Getlink, it is clear: it is impossible
to be successful in the long term without better control of its environmental impact.

**Material challenges**

The environmental commitment of the Group is focused on the challenges that have been deemed the most material, such
as the ones highlighted in the materiality analysis:

the general policy on the management of the environment and, in particular, the training of employees on environmental
issues;

the management of the consumption of energy and the increased use of renewable energy;

the circular economy policy and waste management;

the Tunnel and its rail transport system are intrinsic environmental assets;

the Tunnel runs entirely underground and does not interfere in any way with the marine environment; and

the use of electric power, 90% of which is of nuclear or hydraulic origin, for haulage produces little atmospheric pollution
and much lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels.

Spurred on by the Group, Europorte has stepped up its environmental practices. As well as the implementation of transparent
reporting on abstractions from and discharge into the environment, an environmental impact assessment of the activities of
Europorte’s French entities was completed in 2013, resulting in various measures being taken to mitigate those impacts
namely:

energy consumption optimised to reduce the impact on the greenhouse effect;

environmental criteria taken into account when planning maintenance programmes for its shunting engines (oil leaks
and engine particulate emissions). As at the end of 2017, 42% of the Socorail site is now equipped with new-generation
engines;

appropriate processes set up for sorting/collecting and treating the various types of waste produced;

environmentally-friendly products chosen;

green areas created to park and maintenance of machines;

improved management of hazardous situations involving customers;

awareness-raising among staff about the ways in which they can be green citizens.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

In 2017, Europorte organised its first “Green Week”, which acted as a reminder of Europorte’s commitment to reduce its
environmental impact. It also promoted good behaviour in team members in different topics such as saving energy and
water and recycling both at work as well as in their everyday lives.

**_6.4.1 GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY_**

In the materiality analysis, the general policy for the environment was classified amongst the priorities, and environmental
training for employees was included amongst the important challenges for the Group.

**Governance/steering**

Above and beyond compliance with the legal and regulatory constraints for which a monitoring report is conducted and
published each month, the Concessionaires created a safety and sustainable development department in 2006 to
demonstrate their constant commitment to the environment.

The general policy of the Europorte subsidiaries sets out environmental considerations that require Europorte to control its
environmental impacts, particularly as regards energy consumption. Progress on the resulting environmental action plans is
monitored monthly by the Europorte safety committee and during management reviews. The deployment and the
implementation of this plan are handled by Europorte’s central safety, quality and environment department and more
specifically, the environment quality department and taken up by the regional safety and quality officers.

**Certifications and labels**

As early as 2002, the Concessionaires installed an environmental management system based on the requirements of the
ISO 14001 standard and put in place trained environment officers and internal auditors. An “Environmental Requirements”
clause was also introduced into agreements with its subcontractors. Each year, the Safety and Sustainable Development
Department carries out targeted audits in France and the United Kingdom; in 2017, six internal audits relating to service
providers were carried out.

Since 2014, Europorte has implemented a continuous improvement procedure using the SQAS Rail (safety and quality
assessment system) assessment procedure every three years for all its subsidiaries. This assessment supplements the
MASE and ISO 9001 certifications mentioned in section 3.1.2 of this Registration Document.

Within the framework of the regulatory developments arising from France’s Grenelle Environment Round Table programme,
in September 2013, Socorail obtained EcoPhyto certification for weeding activities conducted on the rail networks of certain
ports and industrial sites. The system implemented is intended to limit the use of phytosanitary products and to better control
their impact.

**Risk prevention**

Pursuant to French law no. 76-663 of 19 July 1976 relating to installations classified for the protection of the environment
(ICPE) the terminals in Coquelles and Sangatte are designated ICPE sites due to the potential dangers and risks that
activities such as refrigeration, air-conditioning, storage and use of flammable liquids, maintenance workshops and paint
may pose to the surrounding area and to health, safety, nature and the environment. These activities are set out in a list
which, on the basis of the severity of the dangers or risks that they may represent, requires them either to be reported to or
authorisation sought from the Prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais. These activities are monitored by the Direction Régionale de
l’Environnement, de l’Aménagement et du Logement (DREAL, the French regional authority for the environment, planning
and housing). Similarly, pursuant to French law 92-3 of 3 January 1992 on water, the Concessionaire France Manche must
request authorisation from the relevant administrative authority for any proposed construction, work or activities to be carried
out outside of the ICPE area, which may pose a danger to public health and safety, endanger the free flow of water, reduce
the availability of water, substantially increase the risk of floods or seriously damage the quality or diversity of the marine
environment.

From the construction of the Tunnel onwards, expenditure has been incurred to prevent the harmful consequences of
business activities for the environment. The System includes separate rain water and waste water collection networks,
retention basins and treatment plants.

The Group has not set aside any provisions for environmental risks, nor did it pay out any compensation for environmental
damage as a result of any court orders during the course of the year. The obligation to establish a financial guarantee as
defined in article L. 516-1 of the French Environmental Code against potential environmental damage does not apply to the
Group’s activities.

No fine of any nature has been imposed on the Group nor has it been reported for non-compliance of its operations.

**Employee awareness/training**

As part of their induction to the company, every new employee learns about the company’s environmental policy, its targets,
and the arrangements put in place to minimise the environmental impacts of its activity. Moreover, the Group is working on
setting up digital CSR training, aimed at increasing employee awareness of the actions undertaken and the challenges faced
by the Group in the areas of social responsibility.

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

**_6.4.2 CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY POLICY_**

**Group policy and challenges**

The materiality review identified the management of energy consumption and the increased use of renewable energy as
very important and important priorities respectively.

As part of its commitment to “low-carbon” transport, the Group is pursuing an ambitious strategy combining the development
of its core activity, cross-Channel transport, with external growth in its two main businesses and areas of expertise other
than the Fixed Link, namely infrastructure management and railway operations. In line with this strategy, Getlink and the
Europorte subsidiaries are developing a broad-based offering of rail freight transport and associated logistics services
throughout France and the United Kingdom.

**Actions and means implemented**

_Emission level measurement_

The Group has developed a policy for monitoring and managing the greenhouse gas emissions of its subsidiaries in
anticipation of the publication of the implementing regulations of article 228 – II of the “Grenelle 2” law. The regulations relate
to mandatory disclosures by entities providing transport services or organising the provision of transport services on the
quantity of carbon dioxide emitted by the mode(s) of transport used to carry out that service. In order to better satisfy the
transparency requirements imposed by article 173 of law 2015-992 of 17 August 2015 on energy transition for green growth,
the Group has initiated a study aimed at identifying the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions which should make it
possible to provide a detailed qualitative analysis for the next financial period in the Fixed Link and elsewhere.

Since 2009, the Group has been certified by The Carbon Trust Standard, an independent organisation that audited the
Group’s management of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 and set the baseline level for greenhouse gas emissions for the
whole of the Group’s activities at 2010 levels. In 2017 the Group’s Carbon Trust Standard certification was renewed in
respect of the Fixed Link in recognition of its carbon footprint reduction policy for the period 2015-2016.

The Group is moreover the only cross-Channel operator to have conducted and published a carbon footprint assessment.
An exhaustive carbon footprint assessment of the Fixed Link was performed in 2007 in both France and the United Kingdom,
using the method developed by ADEME. This carbon footprint assessment identified the Fixed Link’s primary sources of
greenhouse gas emissions. This was followed by an action plan focused on two factors that accounted for 80% of the
emissions, namely refrigeration fluid leakages and the use of energy provided by electricity and fossil fuels.

In the United Kingdom the Concessionaires, as the manager of an infrastructure of major importance to the British economy,
carried out a study of the infrastructure’s ability to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change in line with the Climate
Change Act 2008 and at the request of the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).

In keeping with the 1992 Montreal Protocol, actions were implemented to reduce emissions of all gases leading to the
depletion of the ozone layer. Halon is being removed from the Fixed Link infrastructure. Also, refrigerants used in the cooling
ducts in Sangatte and at Shakespeare Cliff were also replaced. All were replaced on the French side and half on the British
side, with new cooling units that are more energy-efficient and have no significant negative impact on the environment.

_Customer offer_

The Group is committed to leading the way in environmentally responsible transport and makes its expertise and leadership
available to its subsidiaries and customers to help them reduce the carbon footprint of their activities.

An eco-comparison tool is available on the Fixed Link website and can be used by customers to calculate the average
savings on CO2 emission levels when using the Truck Shuttles.

Since 2015, the Group has provided a fast and free of charge recharge facility at the Fixed Link sites in Coquelles
(Pas-de-Calais) and Folkestone (Kent) for customers with electric cars. In thirty minutes, they can charge 80% of the battery
capacity (universal battery chargers), providing a range of over 250 km. There are 16 dedicated spots that can be used
simultaneously at the two terminals of the Channel Tunnel. These are the only sites in Europe to provide such a
comprehensive offering. The number of customers using the Passenger Shuttle in electric cars increased from 40 in 2014
and 800 in 2015 to more than 3,500 in 2016 and 5,805 in 2017. This number is expected to reach 6,000 in 2018.

The Group is continuing to improve its social responsibility programme by encouraging its employees to commute to
Coquelles by other means. It has launched three initiatives from its Business Travel Plan namely a shuttle bus between the
high-speed train station at Calais Fréthun and the Coquelles terminal, a web-based Eurotunnel car-sharing community,
electric cars and bicycles and information on public transport. The arrangements already in place include bicycle racks, fleet
of electric vehicles and recharging points and a remote-working trial. In Folkestone, 70 employees have already signed up
for the government “Cycle to Work” scheme set up in 2016 and some of them joined in the national “Cycle to Work” day on
13 September. These initiatives contribute to minimise the business’s carbon footprint and to promote employees’ wellbeing.

Since 2014, Europorte’s subsidiaries have been awarded TK’ Blue status by the European TK’ Blue Agency. This measures
the ecoresponsible engagement level and the technical, economic, environmental and social performance of their transport
services.

_Energy policy_

Since 2016, the Group has worked to put in place actions to improve energy performance, as identified in the comprehensive
energy audits of the Concession’s operations.

Given their mutual interest in the matter, France Manche and EDF have entered into partnership to promote energy saving.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

The purchase of new wagons to transport road trailers on rail motorways is considered an energy-saving action within this
context.

The entry into service of the first new Truck Shuttle, made of 32 rail motorway wagons at the end of December 2017,
contributed to the granting of Certificats d’Économies d’Énergie (CEEs, energy savings certificates) as part of the “Rail
Motorway Wagon” CEE project.

In 2016, after the installation of new generation electronic variable speed drives which use less energy, the business can
modulate the speed of the cooling fans. As at the end of 2017, the fleet of 100% electric vehicles operating on the Concession
terminals had grown to 39 vehicles.

Europorte France has set up an eco-driving initiative to increase awareness among main line train drivers of the impact of
their driving style on fuel consumption. This initiative also involves the installation of technical equipment designed to reduce
the fuel consumption of locomotives as well as driver assistance systems, depending on the nature of the network and the
train, to help drivers to adopt a more environmentally-friendly driving style. Since 2015, Europorte France has used seven
medium horsepower locomotives of a new model (Vossloh DE18), which provide a 15% to 20% reduction in fuel consumption
for an equivalent level of use.

The energy audits carried out for Europorte in December 2015 and conducted by an approved organisation made it possible
to identify opportunities for reducing energy consumption. As such, an initial experiment in pool-sharing of company cars
was set up in the Lyons area. In January 2016, Arval awarded the eco-responsible mobility award to Europorte for this
initiative.

**Total** **99,189** **84,846**

The Group constantly strives to limit the impact of its activities on the environment.

In 2017, the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 16.9% compared to the previous year. This increase is:

on the one hand, to be put in perspective compared to the reductions recorded in previous years; and

on the other hand, should be viewed:

   - in respect of the Fixed Link in the context of the gradual elimination of halon gases, of an accidental discharge for
reasons of fire safety and of an increase in the use of electricity from the UK for traction efficiency reasons (rather
than the extended power supply available in France, the electron being seven times more carbonised in the UK than
its French equivalent); and

   - for Europorte the increased use of non-electric engines using non road diesel (NRD) on lines not wholly electrified.

Such an increase may occur from time to time and is linked to exceptional events (discharge of halon, increase in the use
of electricity from the UK) or to situations over which the Group has no control. This is the case in respect of the nonelectrification of certain lines of the French rail network which requires the Europorte subsidiaries to use, as part of their
commercial operations, diesel locomotives for journeys not equipped with electrified lines.

It should also be noted that whilst emissions increased in 2017 compared to 2016, they recorded a decrease of 4.3%
between 2013 and 2017, which demonstrates the constant and long-term commitment of the Group to limit the impact of its
activities on the environment.

Efforts are continually being made to reduce the energy consumption of the Group and consequently CO2 emissions. For
that reason, the Shuttle on-board air conditioning systems have been equipped with GSM datacards that will take readings
of the pressure and temperature of the generators every two hours. This will make the detection of leaks quicker and easier
and thereby minimise them. The replacement of some of these on-board air-conditioning systems is being considered.

In 2016 and 2017, an investment was made with the purchase of new HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) units
for the Passenger Shuttles (150 out of a fleet of 450) in order to address the ageing of this equipment. A contract has been
entered into for the complete prototyping of the HVAC system, as part of a project to renew the Passenger Shuttles.

Since the Truck Shuttles began operations, the Group has enabled savings of nearly 3.9 million tonnes of CO2 compared to
the ferries and the Group’s carbon footprint (scope 1 and 2) and greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 55% since 2006.

_15 Emissions linked to the use of fossil fuels in combustion facilities or in transport vehicles (scope 1), as well as fugitive emission of_

_refrigerant fluids, SF6 and halon 1301 (scope 1) and indirect emissions linked to electrical power purchase (scope 2)._

The 1.5% increase in electricity consumption compared to the previous year is linked to the increase in Shuttle traffic. It
should however be noted that the current lighting has been replaced by more economical LED lighting when maintenance
or renewal work has been undertaken in the Concession workshops. This is in addition to the installation of movement
detectors in the administration buildings and the sub-stations. A study is moreover under way to replace the lighting in the
maintenance workshops. Efforts are also being undertaken to replace electrical resistance heating systems with more
economical thermodynamic heating systems.

NRD consumption has risen sharply (24.4% increase) compared to last year because of more sustained Europorte activity,
using non-electric engines on fully non-electrified lines.

Natural gas consumption rose by 5%, due primarily to an increase of almost 25% at Europorte because maintenance work
on engines required a constant background workshop temperature to be maintained.

Efforts are continually being made to reduce consumption. For that reason, all the old boilers have on the UK terminal been
replaced by condensing boilers.

LPG and petrol consumption also dropped by 3% and 9.4% respectively, compared to the previous year.

The consumption of water from the public network rose by 10% compared to the previous year, primarily due to a change
in the Tunnel cooling system valves on the British side and to an accidental water leak in a Europorte maintenance workshop.
Notwithstanding this and with a view to putting in place in 2020 a plan to reduce water consumption across the Concession,
a network of connected meters has been installed in order better to identify the consumption sources.

Consumption taken from the underground water table dropped 12.8% across the Group, which can be attributed to the
malfunctioning of a meter in a fire reservoir portal.

In addition, water offtakes respect the relevant legal constraints.

**_6.4.3 CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT_**

**Group policy and challenges**

According to the findings of the materiality analysis, the circular economy policy and waste management are among the
important challenges for the Group, which has a waste collection and treatment strategy that prioritises recovery or reuse.
Most waste products come from industrial activities and vary in type and quantity from year to year depending on the projects
being undertaken.

It should moreover be noted that, given the nature of its activities, food wastage is not a material issue for the Group. This
subject concerns on-site food services only and data on this subject will not be published for the 2017 financial period.

**Actions and means implemented**

In France, the Fixed Link sorts hazardous and non-hazardous industrial waste, 95% of which is recycled. This process was
made possible by the emergence of new solid fuel recovery channels. There are three ways of recovering waste: improved
sorting, waste buyback and outlets and recycling or free recovery.

For Europorte, almost all the waste produced comes from the maintenance of rolling stock and rail infrastructure. At industrial
sites, waste management procedures are generally the responsibility of the customer. Europorte applies its own waste
management procedures to its port rail infrastructure services at Dunkirk, Nantes-Saint Nazaire and Le Havre-Rouen, and

Europorte Proximité’s locomotive maintenance workshop at Arc-les-Gray. In both these activities, waste is sorted internally
and passed on to a waste service provider for treatment.

United Kingdom 2,824 1,688

 
**Total** **5,684** **7,187**

The production of hazardous industrial waste rose by 14% compared to last year. In respect of ESL, this increase is due to
the change in interceptors (a hydrocarbon filtration arrangement) and a treatment of disposable and rechargeable lamp
batteries as well as in respect of Europorte the increase in activity of a mechanical maintenance workshop. By contrast, the
quantities of non-hazardous industrial waste decreased (almost 21%) since in 2017 the business did not embark on a tree
felling and vegetation clearance programme, as it had done for security reasons in 2016.

The noise of commercial activities and maintenance around installations is also closely monitored. A past study shows that
the activities of the Fixed Link breach no noise standards, whether at the edge of the property or in regulated surrounding
areas, during the day or at night. Measurements were taken in compliance with (i) the technical annex to the Ministerial
Order dated 23 January 1997 on limiting environmental noise by installations classified for environmental protection (ICPE)
without derogating from any of its provisions, and (ii) Standard NF S 31-010 of December 1996 on the characterisation and
measurement of environmental noise-specific measurement methods.

By the nature of its activities, neither the consumption of raw materials nor improving the efficiency of use are relevant issues
for the Group.

**_6.4.4 PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY_**

**Group policy and challenges**

In the area of biodiversity, Getlink complies with the letter and the spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity whose
main goals include the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of its elements.

**Actions and means implemented**

The Concessionaires have large land reserves in France and the United Kingdom and since the construction of the Tunnel
have created several dozen hectares of nature reserves for the conservation and development of biodiversity. In France,
the nature reserves are located within the Concession perimeter and therefore not open to the public. In France, the Jardins
Ordonnés with its seven-hectare lake situated next to the Coquelles terminal are a much-used haven for migrating species
and an essential nest-building site for many birds.

In the United Kingdom, the Samphire Hoe site is a real example of the Group’s determination to take measures to develop
biodiversity and protect the environment. Samphire Hoe, a nature reserve spanning about thirty hectares at the foot of the
Dover cliffs, was created using five million cubic metres of blue chalk and marl extracted from the Channel subsoil when the
Tunnel was bored. This strip of land reclaimed from the sea was gradually transformed into a nature reserve. The White
Cliffs Countryside Partnership (WCCP), in charge of the day-to-day management of this protected space, is supported by
many volunteers living in and around Kent. The partnership between the Concessionaires and WCCP was awarded its 13th
successive Green Flag Award[®] in 2017, recognising the high ecological quality of this nature reserve.

Samphire Hoe attracts over 80,000 visitors each year. Since 2014, a new reception centre, financed jointly by Getlink and
the Heritage Lottery Fund, provides a fully-equipped educational centre for school groups all year round.

In another partnership with WCCP, the Concessionaires are also involved in the upkeep and conservation of the Doll’s
House Hill site, the steep slope overlooking the Folkestone terminal facilities, whose plant and wildlife belong to a Site of
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

The soil and plant life in Biggins Wood were removed when the Folkestone terminal was built and replanted close by in
order to safeguard this testimony of Britain’s primary forest.

**CSR at the heart of the Group’s strategy**

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) requires companies to integrate environmental and social issues into their business
model and strategy. A self-regulation initiative which in its early days was adopted on a voluntary basis, CSR has been
enshrined in a regulatory framework initiated in France since 2001-2002 by the French law Nouvelles Régulations
Economiques (new economic regulations). The verification of sociological, social and environmental data by an independent
third party has gone on to become mandatory for French businesses following the publication in 2012 of the decree


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

implementing article 225 of the Grenelle 2 law and subsequently the ruling of 13 May 2013. The Group has exceeded this
obligation and its initiative goes beyond simple verification.

The Group places social responsibility at the heart of its activities and its interactions with its various internal and external
stakeholders and provides clear information about its commitments to its partners: employees, customers, suppliers,
shareholders, investors, regional government bodies, local authorities, associations and communities. True to its principles,
for over 20 years it has operated a policy that is both demanding and concrete in respect of corporate social responsibility,
in three main areas that represent the strategic priorities of its business:

People, i.e. each of the 3,400 Group employees;

Nature, i.e. the environment and the eco-systems with which its growing operations interact;

Region, i.e. all communities the Group is connected to everywhere in France, in the UK and in Europe.

The Group has developed a CSR policy which is based on the respect of fundamental rights as defined by the major founding
international texts: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

The Group’s Board and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer fully support the principles stated in these international
codes and standards. The purpose of this policy is to translate this support into a set of operational procedures defining a
common approach for all Group entities.

Compliance with this policy will be continuously monitored under the close scrutiny of the Group’s Board supported by the
Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee. Stakeholders shall also be informed of the policy via the Group’s various
annual reports.

The CSR targets will be defined each year and will form part of the targets set for the directors and managers of the various
Group entities. They shall be monitored and assessed during individual annual reviews.

Each manager shall be charged with ensuring that the stated principles are communicated to all employees and are further
understood and observed by them.

**Challenges**

The Group has identified five major challenges which correspond to core issues set out in the major founding texts and the
various international frameworks and standards (Global Compact; GRL, ISO 26000). These challenges can be split into
several categories: social, regional, environmental, economic and ethical.

Social challenges: respecting the rights of employees;

Regional challenges: developing close links with the region;

Environmental challenges: reducing the impact of the business activity on the environment;

Economic challenges: managing relationships with customers;

Ethical challenges: continuing with policy development and value sharing within the Group in connection with
stakeholders.

Answering these challenges has been and remains a priority for the Group which, since its inception, has been committed
to a social responsibility policy reconciling economic performance, social equity and environmental protection as part of a
programme of continuous improvement.

_Social challenges_

For the Group, responding to the social challenges involves a commitment to fully support a work environment which fosters
the personal development and growth of its workers. The human resources policies are developed on the basis of criteria
which support truly equal opportunities and treatment for all employees. In its Charter of Ethics and Behaviour, the Group
has effectively committed itself to combating all forms of discrimination. In the same Charter, it strongly reasserts its
adherence to the principles and values of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the fundamental
conventions of the International Labour Organization as well as to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact.

In order to reinforce the development of its workers and to guarantee a stable and safe working environment for them, the
Group has made the issue of improving security and health at work a major concern with the renewed and expressed target
of zero accidents. Mindful of the progression of its employees’ performance, the Group considers the individual annual
review to be an essential management tool for human resources and has therefore set a target for all managers in the
company of 100% reviews.

The Group invests heavily in young people and is developing its relationships with universities and schools with the aim of
fostering a better understanding of its business and of better integrating young people into the world of work. This is why an
agreement was signed in January 2013 with the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées creating for a period of five years
an education and research chair for the science of railway transport dedicated to the study of railway activity. The aim of this
chair is training and research on the topics associated with infrastructure and transport service. This initiative attests to the
Group’s willingness to share its expertise in order to advance science and innovation and to position the railway sector as a
profession of the future.

The Group is also strongly focused on training for careers in the railway sector. Created by the Group in 2011, the CIFFCO
international railway training centre contributes to the creation of skilled jobs and professional integration. It plays a leading
role in the development of railway transport and its associated businesses and, more generally, plays a part in the economic
development and influence of the Hauts-de-France region.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

_Regional challenges_

As a committed partner in its economic and social environment, the Group has always been a leading economic player and
local employer. As part of its mission, it fully subscribes to a logic of “community involvement”, understood as defined by
ISO 26000 “proactive outreach work undertaken by an organisation within the community with the aim of preventing and
solving problems, fostering partnerships with local organisations and stakeholders and being a good citizen of
the community”.

The Group has contributed to the creation of several thousand direct, indirect and induced jobs in Kent and the Calais region
and has, as part of its role as a developer, strongly contributed to the growth of the local economy at either end of the Tunnel
and to the positive transformation of the environment in which it operates.

The Group is conscious of the fact that community involvement is not limited to responsibility for the impact of its activities
on the environment but involves responsible behaviour and good citizenship. It is also constantly seeking ways to strengthen
its integration into its immediate environment by means of firm commitments and actions of solidarity geared towards the
community. The Group also supports education and culture and is conscious that sharing knowledge is a factor which
promotes more equal opportunities.

The Group considers its regional commitment to be essential as it contributes to the company’s overall performance, to the
internal climate and social cohesion and to the loyalty of its employees.

In order to meet these challenges, the Group is committed to strengthening links with local communities by actively
supporting associations, schools, universities and organisations with which it works closely on both sides of the Fixed Link.

_Environmental challenges_

In a world with limited natural resources, companies cannot ensure their continuity without making constant efforts to control
their energy consumption and reduce the impact of their operations on the environment. For Getlink, it is clear: it is impossible
to be successful in the long term without better control of its environmental impact.

As part of its commitment to “low-carbon” transport, the Group is pursuing an ambitious strategy combining the development
of its core activity, cross-Channel transport, with external growth in its two main business and areas of expertise other than
the Fixed Link, namely infrastructure management and railway operations.

Since the construction of the Tunnel, expenditure has been incurred to prevent the harmful consequences of business
activities for the environment. There are two separate sewer systems for rain water and waste water, retention ponds,
treatment stations, etc. Furthermore, an environmental management system based on the requirements of ISO 14001 was
put in place by the Concessionaires in 2002.

For 2018, the Group is committed to acting in line with the principles of sustainable development and in accordance with the
principles of the Global Compact relating to the environment. In order to achieve this, the Group has four commitments:

to reduce the environmental impacts of its own operations by focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing
its energy consumption, increasing its fleet of electric vehicles and optimising waste management;

to raise awareness amongst staff of their responsibilities as eco-citizens;

to choose innovative and environmentally friendly products;

to strengthen actions which support the protection of diversity.

In addition to these commitments, the Group will pay special attention to the environmental approach of its suppliers and
will ask them to implement actions which would support the protection of the environment.

_Economic challenges_

The Group places a focus on each individual customer at the heart of its development plan. Quality of service is both an
everyday and a strategic priority and expectation for its teams within all of its subsidiaries.

Rooted in a binational culture where the concept of “customer” prevails, the Group is continually investing in adapting its
offer, the quality of customer services, punctuality, smoothness, comfort and security around a central objective: to
constantly increase the high level of quality of service which forms the basis of its economic growth. A golden rule is applied:
every innovation and every investment project must demonstrate that it benefits customers before being adopted. This
continuous improvement initiative is of particular importance today when, more than 20 years after the start of operations, a
new generation of customers is emerging.

This commitment was consolidated in 2013 by the launch of important projects in the various Group subsidiaries, such as
the creation of a Customer Experience Department, the renovation of the terminals and Truck Shuttle wagons, a mobile
telephone service throughout the Tunnel, etc.

The leading private railway operator in France and the UK, Europorte, a Group subsidiary, stands out by the quality of its
service.

Committed to a continuous improvement initiative, the Group is carrying out a transformation project in its terminals where
the reception capacity will be increased in order to offer, as of 2015, more departures, toll lanes and secure parking to
respond smoothly to the expected growth in truck traffic.

The Group and its subsidiary service companies aim to achieve a higher level of quality of service for 2018. Customer
satisfaction is an absolute priority for the Group. For 2018, it has set a central goal for the sector of a customer satisfaction
rate of 90% for the passenger activity and 85% for commercial truck activity.

In order to meet the challenges of responsible supply, the Group has undertaken work to identify and evaluate its main
suppliers in the field of sustainable development.


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

_Ethical challenges_

In order to define its priorities, the Group is involved in and is continuing an ongoing dialogue with its internal and external
stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, local communities, competitors, public authorities
and trade unions. This dialogue helps the Group to better understand societal developments and the associated challenges,
to develop new topics and to start reflecting on the pilot projects.

The Group’s aim is to be viewed as a benchmark and a model within the transport industry in the area of corporate social
responsibility and intends to maintain its role as a major player in cross-Channel transport and its position as global leader
in piggyback transport.

This ambition requires clearly stated commitments. The Group achieves this by committing through this policy to developing
a climate of trust and loyal relationships with all of its internal and external stakeholders. It is particularly committed to:

staying loyal to its customers and partners;

instigating, maintaining and encouraging an open dialogue with the various stakeholders;

strengthening its community involvement;

strictly observing the fundamental rights as defined in the major international principles: the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work;

reporting its economic, social and environmental results with the greatest transparency.

The Group’s social and environmental reporting is based on information stipulated in article 225 of French law 2010-788 of
12 July 2010, known as the “Grenelle 2” law, and the transparency principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

The Group’s CSR data is consolidated under the responsibility of the Group Human Resources Department.

**Consolidation period for CSR reporting**

The period used for annual reporting of workforce and societal data is the calendar year (1 January 2017 to 31 December
2017).

Environmental data, however, is reported on a rolling year basis (from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017) as data and
supporting evidence for the full year is not available within a timescale compatible with the publication date of the Registration
Document.

**Scope of consolidation**

Data is consolidated for all Group entities, with the exception of ElecLink and GET SE in respect of environmental data.

**Choice of indicators**

The purpose of the indicators is to monitor the commitments made by the Group and its progress in terms of environmental
and workforce performance. The indicators were chosen by the Group because they are appropriate to its activities and
serve the needs of stakeholders as well as its regulatory obligations.

Workforce indicators have been chosen to:

measure the results of the human resources policy and the Group’s social commitments,

take account of cultural differences and local disparities (different national law, varying legal obligations, etc.).

Environmental indicators have been chosen to:

serve environmental policy and reflect progress in the Group’s different activities; the indicators chosen are appropriate
to the Group’s activities,

allow monitoring of the Group’s performance on key environmental issues.

**Internal consolidation and control**

Workforce information is collected from each entity through a computerised data feedback system, which includes
consistency checks. The data is checked and validated by the Group’s entities and consolidated across the entire scope by
the Group Human Resources Department.

Each entity’s environmental information is collected through the computerised data feedback system. The data is checked
and validated by each Group entity and is then consolidated by the Group Human Resources Department.

During consolidation of workforce and environmental data, consistency checks are carried out at Group level. Comparisons
are made with the results from previous years and discrepancies deemed significant are analysed and examined in
greater detail.

Societal information is collected, checked and validated at the level of each entity. It is then centralised by the Group Human
Resources Department.

**Further information and methodological limits of the indicators collected**

The methodologies used for some workforce and environmental indicators may in practice be limited by:

a lack of harmonisation in national/international definitions and legislation,

the representativeness of the measurements taken or limited availability of external data needed to calculate
the indicator,


-----

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

the qualitative and therefore subjective nature of some data,

the practical methods used to collect and input this data.

_Consumption of natural gas_

Consumption at Europorte’s subsidiary sites has been extrapolated on the basis of a ratio of natural gas consumption / m² /
day. This ratio was calculated based on data from sites equipped with meters.

_Europorte consumption of electricity_

For premises, the consumption of electricity has been estimated on the basis of average consumption per site relative to the
surface area of the site.

For motor engines, the consumption of electricity has been estimated using kilometres travelled by engines, according to a
methodology agreed by all the parties involved (Europorte, the French Rail Network/Network Rail and the energy supplier).

_Greenhouse gas emissions_

The calculation of emissions of greenhouse gases is based on the methodology developed by the Carbon Trust. For some
incoming refrigerant data, the emission factors are based on the product safety data sheets. The emission factors used to
convert the consumption of energy are those of ADEME in France and DEFRA for all other consumption.

_Waste products_

Data relating to waste generated by operations at customers’ sites, collected for the monitoring of the activities of contractors,
is excluded from the scope of reporting.

_Consumption of water_

The consumption of water for the Europorte subsidiary sites not equipped with meters has been extrapolated by applying a
ratio of consumption of water in cubic metres per employee present on site per day from sites equipped with meters.

_Rate of absenteeism_

In the calculation of the rate of absenteeism for the four French Europorte entities, the number of scheduled hours is obtained
by multiplying the number of full time equivalent staff by the number of theoretical hours.

_Training_

The training budget is the sum of logistics costs (when available), external costs and the related staff costs.

Salary and employers’ costs are extracted from the payroll systems by the human resources departments.

_Rate of non-permanent employment_

Trainees and student-apprentices on professionalisation contracts are excluded.

**External audit**

In order to ensure that it provides reliable information, each year the Group requests the opinion of an independent third
party regarding the quality of its workforce and environmental information collection and reporting procedures. In 2017, the
audit was carried out by KPMG. The 2017 assurance report expresses reasonable assurance for three environmental

indicators, ten social indicators (information marked ) and one societal indicator, and limited assurance for all other
information presented in chapter 6 of this Registration Document.

**MANAGEMENT REPORT**

_This is a free English translation of the statutory auditors’ report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience_
_of English-speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law_
_and professional standards applicable in France._

For the year ended 31 December 2017

To the Shareholders,

In our capacity as statutory auditor of Group Eurotunnel SE, (hereinafter named the “Company”), appointed as independent
third party and certified by COFRAC under number 3-1049[16], we hereby report to you on the consolidated human resources,
environmental and social information for the year ended 31 December 2017, included in the management report (hereinafter
named “CSR Information”), pursuant to article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).

**Company’s responsibility**

The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a company’s management report including the CSR Information required
by article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code in accordance with the guidelines used by the Company (hereinafter
the “Guidelines”), summarised in the management report and available on request from the Company’s head office.

**Independence and quality control**

Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession and
the requirements of article L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, we have implemented a system of

_16 Whose scope is available at www.cofrac.fr._

###### CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

**Statutory auditor’s responsibility**

On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to:

attest that the required CSR Information is included in the management report or, in the event of non-disclosure of a part
or all of the CSR Information, that an explanation is provided in accordance with the third paragraph of article R. 225105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information);

express a limited assurance conclusion that the CSR Information taken as a whole is, in all material respects, fairly
presented in accordance with the Guidelines (Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information);

at the request of the Company and out of the scope of certification, express reasonable assurance, that information
selected[17] by the Group and identified by the symbol (√) in the chapter 6 of the management report is fairly presented,
in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines (Reasonable assurance on a selection of CSR information).

However, it is not our responsibility to pronounce on the compliance with the relevant legal provisions applicable if necessary,
in particular those envisaged by article L. 225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code (Duty of care) and by the law n° 20161691 of 9 December 2016 known as Sapin II (fight against corruption).

Our work involved six persons and was conducted between September 2017 and February 2018 during a thirteen-week
period. We were assisted in our work by our CSR experts.

We performed our work in accordance with the order dated 13 May 2013 defining the conditions under which the independent
third party performs its engagement and with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of statutory auditors
(Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement and with ISAE 3000[18] concerning our
conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information.

**1.** **Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information**

**Nature and scope of our work**

On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant departments, we obtained an understanding of the
Company’s sustainability strategy regarding human resources and environmental impacts of its activities and its social
commitments and, where applicable, any actions or programmes arising from them.

We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list provided in article R. 225-105-1 of the
French Commercial Code.

For any consolidated information that is not disclosed, we verified that explanations were provided in accordance with article
R. 225-105, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code.

We verified that the CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Company, its subsidiaries as defined by
article L. 233-1 and the controlled entities as defined by article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, within the limitations
set out in section 6.8 of the management report.

**Conclusion**

Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has
been disclosed in the management report.

**2.** **Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information**

**Nature and scope of our work**

We conducted fifteen interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information and, where appropriate,
responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to:

assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and
understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate;

verify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and
consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures
used to prepare the CSR Information.

We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR
Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its
activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices.

Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important and presented in Appendix:

at parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative
information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified,
using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was
consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report;

at the level of a representative sample of entities selected by us[19] on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the
consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly
applied and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile

the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents 99% of headcount considered as material data
of social issues and 100% of environmental data considered as material data[20] of environmental issues.

For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the Company.

We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in
part.

We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient
to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more
extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control
systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated.

**Conclusion**

Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR
Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.

**3.** **Reasonable assurance on a selection of CSR Information**

**Nature and scope of our work**


For the information selected by the Group and identified by the symbol, our audit consisted of work of the same nature as
described in paragraph 2 above for CSR information considered the most important, but in more depth, particularly regarding
the number of tests.

The selected sample represents 99% of headcount considered as material data of social issues and 100% of quantitative

environmental information identified by the symbol published.

We consider that this work enables us to express a conclusion of reasonable assurance for the information selected by the

Group and identified by the symbol .

**Conclusion**


In our opinion, the information selected by the Group and identified by the symbol is fairly presented, in all material
respects, in compliance with the Guidelines.

**Free shares – collective plans**

The General Meeting of shareholders of 28 April 2011, in its 7[th] resolution, authorised the Board to proceed, on one or more
occasions, to grant free ordinary shares already in issue to all employees of GET SE and of companies or entities related
to it (pursuant to article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code), including companies or entities located abroad
(except for executive employees and executive officers of GET SE referred to in article L. 225-197-1 II of the French
Commercial Code who waived their rights). The total number of free ordinary shares granted pursuant to the 7[th] resolution
approved at the general meeting of shareholders of 28 April 2011, cannot, over three years, exceed 1,748,000 ordinary
shares. On 28 April 2011 and 26 April 2012, GET SE awarded each of the Group’s employees (excluding executive
employees and executive officers) free of charge, 200 ordinary shares (2011) and 310 ordinary shares (2012). The definitive
acquisition of these ordinary shares was conditional on staff remaining as employees of the Group and the shares continuing
to be held for a minimum period of four years.

Further to the approval of the shareholders’ General Meeting held on 29 April 2014, the Board granted 369,100 free ordinary
shares already in issue to all employees of GET SE and of companies or entities related to it (except for senior management
and executive officers of GET SE) on the basis of 100 ordinary shares per employee. The definitive acquisition of these
ordinary shares is conditional on staff remaining as employees of the Group and the shares continuing to be held for a
minimum period of four years.

Further to the approval of the shareholders’ General Meeting held on 29 April 2015, the Board granted 583,500 free ordinary
shares to all employees of GET SE and of companies or entities related to it (except for senior management and executive
officers of GET SE) on the basis of 150 ordinary shares per employee. The definitive acquisition of these ordinary shares is
conditional on staff remaining as employees of the Group and the shares continuing to be held for a minimum period of
four years.

Further to the approval of the shareholders’ General Meeting held on 27 April 2016, the Board granted 302,325 free ordinary
shares to all employees of GET SE and of companies or entities related to it (except for senior management and executive
officers of GET SE) on the basis of 75 ordinary shares per employee. The definitive acquisition of these ordinary shares is
conditional on staff remaining as employees of the Group and the shares continuing to be held for a minimum period of
four years.

Further to the approval of the shareholders’ General Meeting held on 27 April 2017, the Board granted 253,800 free ordinary
shares to all employees of GET SE and of companies or entities related to it (except for senior management and executive
officers of GET SE) on the basis of 75 ordinary shares per employee. The definitive acquisition of these ordinary shares is
conditional on staff remaining as employees of the Group and the shares continuing to be held for a minimum period of
four years.

**Preference shares**

Groupe Eurotunnel SE issued preference shares convertible into ordinary shares subject to performance conditions to the
Group’s senior manager staff in accordance with the authorisation given by the General Meeting on 29 April 2014 (B
preference shares) and by the General Meeting on 29 April 2015 (C preference shares). A proposal will be put to the General
Meeting of 18 April 2018 that further preference shares (D preference shares) be created, convertible into ordinary shares
subject to certain performance conditions. These shares are described in section 8.2.2 of this Registration Document.

**Free ordinary shares with performance conditions**

The General Meeting of 27 April 2017 which authorised the grant of a total of 1,200,000 ordinary shares subject to
performance criteria to members of the Group’s senior staff. The vesting of the ordinary shares is based on achieving the
following three cumulative performance criteria (with one being external to the Group and the two others internal to
the Group):


-----

###### SHARE CAPITAL AND OWNERSHIP

the external performance condition (the “TSR weighting”) is based on the average performance including dividends
(TSR) of the GET ordinary share over a period of three years compared to the performance of the Dow Jones
Infrastructure Index. This element determines 40% of the total number of shares that can be granted. The final attribution
of ordinary shares linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective as follows:

   - should the TSR of the GET ordinary share be strictly less than the performance of the TSR of the components of the
index over the period, no shares would be granted;

   - should the TSR of the GET ordinary share be equal to the performance of the index over the period, 15% of the
number that can be granted will be granted up to a maximum of 40% of the number that can be granted;

the first internal performance condition (the “EBITDA weighting”) is based on the Group’s financial performance,
assessed by reference to the average rate of achievement of EBITDA over a period of two years covering 2018 and
2019. This element determines 50% of the total number of shares that can be granted. The final attribution of shares
linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective as follows:

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 be strictly less than 100% of the average of
the EBITDA communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, no shares would be granted; and

   - should the average rate of achievement of EBITDA in 2018 and 2019 be equal to 100% of the average of the EBITDA
communicated to the market by Groupe Eurotunnel SE for these years, 15% of the number that can be granted would
effectively be granted up to a limit of 50% of the total number that can be granted.

the second internal performance condition (the “CSR weighting”) is based on the CSR Composite Index. This element
determines 10% of the total number of shares that can be granted.

The General Meeting of 27 April 2016 authorised the grant of 1,200,000 ordinary shares subject to performance conditions
to the Group’s senior staff. Final vesting of the ordinary shares depends on fulfilment of the following three cumulative
performance conditions:

The external performance condition (TSR) represents 40% of the total that can be granted and depends on the
performance with dividend of the Groupe Eurotunnel SE ordinary share compared to the median TSR of the components
of the Dow Jones Infrastructure index, over a period of three years:

   - There will be no allocation if the TSR of the GET SE ordinary share does not reach the median TSR of the
components of the index;

   - If the performance is comparable to the median, the allocation will be 15% of the initial amount.

The first internal performance condition represents 50% of the total that can be granted and depends on the economic
performance of the business, calculated by reference to the average EBITDA achievement rate (50%):

   - If the EBITDA achievement rate is strictly less than 100% of the average of the EBITDA for 2017 and 2018 announced
to the market, there will be no allocation.

   - If the performance is comparable to the objective, the allocation will only be 15%.

The second internal performance condition represents 10% of the total that can be granted and depends on the CSR
composite index.

**Potential volume of all share plans**

As at 31 December 2017, the total number of stock options granted but not yet exercised (after deduction, if applicable, of
stock options cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was 1,163,925 (compared to 1,641,250 at
31 December 2016) representing approximately 0.21% of the capital of GET SE as at 31 December 2017.

As at 31 December 2017, the total number of free ordinary shares granted to employees still with the Group was
573,075 ordinary shares (compared to 954,550 ordinary shares at 31 December 2016), representing 0.10% of the share
capital as at 31 December 2017.

As at 31 December 2017, the total number of preference B shares allotted but not yet irrevocably vested (after deduction, if
applicable, of shares cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was 278 (compared to 278 at
31 December 2016), representing 1,390,000 ordinary shares, representing approximately 0.25% of the capital of GET SE
as at 31 December 2017.

As at 31 December 2017, the total number of preference C shares allotted but not yet irrevocably vested (after deduction, if
applicable, of shares cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was 1,156 (compared to 1,784 at
31 December 2016), representing 578,000 ordinary shares, representing approximately 0.16% of the capital of GET SE as
at 31 December 2017.

As at 31 December 2017, the total number of free ordinary shares with performance conditions, granted but not yet
irrevocably vested (after deduction, if applicable, of shares cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was
2,379,750 (compared to 1,179,750 at 31 December 2016), representing 0.43% of the share capital as at 31 December 2017.

The potential volume of all share plans existing above would correspond to 1.11% of GET SE’s share capital.

The average annual burn rate of the company over the past three fiscal years corresponds to 0.27%.

plan in France and 223,846 ordinary shares in the Share Incentive Plan in the United Kingdom. In addition, under the free
shares scheme French and British employees hold 746,060 ordinary shares and 881 preference shares in French registered
form and, through a trustee, 71,338 ordinary shares in British registered form.

The number of free shares which have been granted or waived during the financial period is detailed in note E.5 to the
consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

**_7.1.5 SHARE CAPITAL HISTORY OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS_**

**Class C preference shares**

The General Meeting held on 29 April 2015 authorised the Board to grant to executive officers and executive employees of
the company and its subsidiaries preference shares with a nominal value of €0.01 (C preference shares) without voting
rights, which may, after a four-year period, be converted into ordinary shares subject to performance conditions. Description
of the terms and conditions of the C preference shares is set out under section 8.2.2 of this Registration Document.

**7.2** **DIVIDEND POLICY**

GET SE’s net profit for the 2017 financial year amounted to €69,749,545. The General Meeting of 18 April 2018 will be
asked to approve the company’s statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 showing this profit, as well as
the transactions reflected in those financial statements, including non-deductible charges (€53,230) corresponding to the
surplus of the depreciation of the rent on tourist vehicles (article 39-4 of the French General Tax Code).

GET SE intends to maintain and reinforce its dividend policy. On 18 April 2018, GET SE will propose to its shareholders a
dividend distribution of €0.30 per ordinary share with a nominal value of €0.40 comprising the share capital and with dividend
rights. GET SE will propose to its shareholders a dividend distribution of €165 million for the 550,000,000 ordinary shares
comprising the share capital and with dividend rights less shares held by the company on the date of distribution. It will be
proposed at the annual General Meeting that the entire profit for the 2017 financial year be allocated to the dividend
distribution together with €95,250,455 from previous years’ retained earnings, since the legal reserve has been fully used.

Net profit for the financial year €69,749,545

Profits carried forward €273,385,107

Legal reserve €22,422,885

Dividends €165,000,000

Balance carried forward €178,134,652

If, on the date of the distribution of the dividend, the company holds some of its own shares, the amount not paid because
of these treasury ordinary shares will be allocated to retained earnings.

GET SE has made the following dividend distributions over the course of the last three years:

**Financial year** **2016** **2015** **2014**

Dividend per ordinary share €0.26 €0.22 €0.18

Theoretical number of ordinary shares involved 550,000,000 550,000,000 550,000,000

Theoretical value of amount allocated to distribution €143,000,000 €121,000,000 €99,000,000

Actual number of ordinary shares involved* 534,633,788 537,065,436 540,399,917

Actual value of amount allocated to distribution* €139,004,785 €118,154,396 €97,271,985

_*_ _After adjustment resulting from treasury shares._

The dividend policy is determined by the Board; it takes into account the Group’s investment needs, the economic context
and all other factors deemed relevant.

The Group’s priority is to ensure a regular increase in the remuneration of its shareholders, while preserving sufficient
self-financing capacity to enable investment in the Tunnel and to ensure the Group’s development. As a result, the Group
intends to pursue its policy of steady dividend growth for its shareholders with a view to achieving an objective of a dividend
of €0.35 per share for the 2018 financial year and of €0.40 per share for the 2019 financial year. In this perspective, the
Group will therefore propose to increase the dividend for the 2017 financial year to €0.30 per ordinary share with dividend
rights.

This objective is by no means a commitment by the Group; future dividends will depend, in particular, on the Group’s results
and financial position.

**7.3** **SHARE BUYBACK**

The General Meeting of shareholders held on 27 April 2017, authorised GET SE to purchase, or procure the purchase of its
own ordinary shares, under the conditions set by articles L. 225-209 et seq. of the French Commercial Code.

###### SHARE CAPITAL AND OWNERSHIP

**_7.3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE 2017 SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME_**

The characteristics of the share buyback programme were determined by the Board on 27 April 2017 and published pursuant
to article 241-2 of the General Regulations of the AMF. Pursuant to the 2017 buyback programme, GET SE is authorised,
for a period of 18 months to purchase, or to procure the purchase of, its own ordinary shares under the conditions set out in
articles L. 225-209 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the provisions of EU Commission Regulation 596/2014 of
16 April 2014, which applies directly.

The following applies in respect of the programme:

the purchase price per share must not exceed €13, it being stipulated that the Board may nevertheless adjust this
purchase price should transactions occur giving rise to an increase in the nominal value of ordinary shares or the creation
and grant of free shares, as well as a decrease of the nominal value of the ordinary shares or the consolidation of ordinary
shares or any other transaction affecting equity in order to reflect the impact of such transaction on the value of the
ordinary shares;

the maximum amount of funds allocated for the purchase of ordinary shares under this programme may not, based on
the number of shares in issue at 28 February 2017, exceed €715,000,000 (corresponding to a maximum of 55,000,000
ordinary shares at a maximum price of €13 per share, as stated above);

the maximum proportion of the share capital authorised by shareholders at the GET SE combined General Meeting of
27 April 2017 for purchase under the buyback programme was limited to 10% of the total ordinary shares composing
GET SE’s share capital at the time.

The transactions carried out by GET SE within the scope of the 2017 buyback programme may be effected with a view to
any allocation permissible by law or that may become permissible by the law, in particular for the following purposes:

to deliver shares upon the exercise of rights attached to negotiable securities giving the right by reimbursement,
conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means to the allocation of ordinary shares in the company;

to implement (i) share option schemes; or (ii) free shares plans; or (iii) the granting of ordinary shares purchased by the
company under this resolution, to the benefit of employees participating in a company savings plan under the conditions
provided by articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Employment Code, or under a transfer or grant of ordinary shares,
including under an employee saving plan, including for the purposes of a Share Incentive Plan in the United Kingdom,
or (iv) the granting of shares to employees and/or executive officers of the company or any entity connected thereto, in
accordance with the relevant laws and regulation in force;

to implement market practices within the context of a liquidity contract entered into in accordance with a securities ethics
charter recognised by the AMF; and

to reduce the capital of the company by way of cancellation of shares pursuant to resolution 17 (subject to its approval)
or any similar decision.

**_7.3.2 SUMMARY OF TRANSACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY GET SE ON ITS OWN SECURITIES UNDER THE BUYBACK_**

**_PROGRAMME APPROVED BY THE COMBINED GENERAL MEETING ON 27 APRIL 2017_**

Between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017, GET SE purchased a total of 849,000 ordinary shares for an average
purchase price of €10.241.

On 31 December 2017, GET SE held[21] 15,499,726 of its own ordinary shares, mainly to cover stock option (1,163,925) and

performance conditions in which the shares are not yet vested (2,379,750) and reserved for subsequent use in exchange
or payment in connection with possible external growth transactions (8,372,283). These own shares represented 2.82% of
GET SE’s share capital at 31 December 2017, with a nominal value of €6,199,890.40 and a value, based on the average
purchase price (€7.891), of €122,307,571 not including the liquidity contract.

###### SHARE CAPITAL AND OWNERSHIP

**7.4** **MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS**

**_7.4.1 MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS_**

As at 31 December 2017 and as at the date of this Registration Document, GET SE’s share capital comprised
550,000,000 ordinary shares and the theoretical number of voting rights to be used to determine the thresholds was
639,025,866. The total number of exercisable voting rights in General Meeting was 623,244,677.

The difference:

between the theoretical number of voting rights and the number of exercisable voting rights at General Meeting is not
significant: it arises from the treasury shares held by GET SE as part of its share buyback programme described in
section 7.3.1 of this Registration Document and the voting rights for which have been suspended; and

between the number of shares comprising the share capital and the theoretical number of voting rights is not significant:
it arises from double voting rights granted to shareholders holding their shares in registered form as indicated in
section 8.2.4 of this Registration Document.

The distribution of GET SE’s share capital is as follows:


**31 December**

**2016**


**Shareholding (% of capital):**


**31 December**

**2017**


– Individuals 8.48% 9.39%

– Custodian 49.63% 59.12%

– Institutions 39.07% 28.64%

– Treasury 2.82% 2.85%

Number of shares 550,000,000 550,000,000

The company may, in accordance with regulations, at any time ask the securities clearing house for the name, nationality
and address of persons holding securities that, immediately or in future, give the right to vote at its shareholders’ meetings,
as well as the number of securities held by each. The company may limit its request for the above information to persons
holding a certain number of shares. On the basis of the last such request as at 31 December 2017, the geographical
distribution of shareholdings was estimated as follows:

**% of capital**

France 14%

United Kingdom 26%

United States 36%

Rest of World 24%

**TOTAL** **100%**

**TCI Fund Management Limited**

In a letter received on 29 January 2018, TCI Fund Management Limited (7 Clifford Street, London W1S 2FT, United
Kingdom) declared to the AMF (AMF declaration 218C0284) that its holding of shares in GET SE had exceeded the threshold
of 10% of the capital of GET SE and that it held 60,948,743 shares representing the same number of voting rights, i.e.
11.08% of the capital and 9.54% of the voting rights, on the basis of 550,000,000 shares representing 639,048,698 voting
rights, as follows:

**Shares** **% capital** **Voting rights** **% of voting rights**

The Children's Investment Master Fund 49,279,451 8.96 49,279,451 7.71

Talos Capital DAC 11,669,292 2.12 11,669,292 1.83

**Total TCI Fund Management Limited** **60,948,743** **11.08** **60,948,743** **9.54**

This threshold crossing results from a purchase of ordinary shares on the market.

To the best of the company’s knowledge no other shareholder directly or indirectly or acting in concert with another party
holds more than 5% of the capital or voting rights.

**History**

For the record, The Capital Group Companies Inc has, since January 2018, reduced its stake in the share capital below the
5% threshold:

- By letter received on 26 January 2018, the Capital Group Companies Inc. (333 South Hope Street, 55[th] Floor, Los
Angeles, CA 90071-1406, United States), declared to the AMF (AMF declaration 218C0240) that its holding of shares in
GET SE had, on 24 January 2018, dropped below the threshold of 5% of GET SE’s share capital and that it held
17,721,401 ordinary shares, representing the same number of voting rights, i.e. 3,22% of the capital and 2,77% of the
voting rights of the company, based on capital comprising 550,000,000 ordinary shares representing 639,048,698 voting
rights. This threshold crossing results from a sale of ordinary shares on the market.

**_7.4.2 CONTROL_**

To the best of the knowledge of GET SE, there are no agreements that, if implemented, would bring about a change of
control of GET SE.

The legal and regulatory obligations apply in the case of a threshold being crossed. GET SE’s by-laws do not contain any
obligations other than those relating to 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 33⅓%, 50%, 66⅔%, 90% et 95% of the capital and
of the voting rights.

The bylaws of Groupe Eurotunnel SE contain no provisions whereby a change of control of Groupe Eurotunnel SE can be
delayed, deferred or prevented. Groupe Eurotunnel SE is aware of no agreements that could bring about restrictions in the
transfer of shares or the exercise of voting rights.

Apart from the double voting rights described in section 8.2.4 of this Registration Document, there are no specific voting
rights attached to any GET SE shares. However, the B preference shares and the C preference shares, referred to in
section 8.2.2 of this Registration Document, do not carry voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary general shareholders’
meetings for holders of ordinary shares, although it should be noted that they do carry voting rights at special shareholders’
meetings for holders of B shares and C shares.

**7.5** **TRAVEL PRIVILEGES**

GET SE offers its shareholders a travel privilege programme for Passenger Shuttle crossings. This programme offers a 30%
reduction on the standard fare up to a limit of six one-way tickets (equivalent to three return tickets) per year. Shareholders
holding at least 750 ordinary shares continuously for more than three months are eligible for the programme. GET SE’s
Board has renewed this programme on identical terms for a new period of three years until 31 December 2019.

The general conditions of this travel privilege programme are available on the Group’s website www.getlinkgroup.com.

###### 1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Tunnel is governed by Franco-British agreements (the Treaty of Canterbury, signed on 12 February 1986 and the
Concession contract of 14 March 1986) and by the relevant European rules and regulations and Franco-British binational
transposition regulations.

The Treaty of Canterbury, which authorised the construction and operation of the Fixed Link by private concessionary
companies, prohibits the use of government funds. Accordingly, since the Concessionaires do not benefit from public funds
they are not bound by the separation obligations imposed on the railway companies and on the infrastructure managers in
respect of their activities. These obligations are intended to prevent possible cross-subsidies between activities financed by
public funds and other activities, mainly competitive ones.

The Concessionaires do not receive public funds, are not railway companies and are not subject to the separation obligation.
This derogatory status is enshrined by the article 2.9 of the 2012/34/EU Directive of 21 November 2012 and Directive
2016/2370/EU Directive of 4 December 2016 (4th railway package) has confirmed the exemption for the Group’s Shuttle
Services.

**8.1** **MATERIAL CONTRACTS**

Other than the material agreements described in this section, the Group’s business activity is not dependent on any
industrial, commercial or financial contract. Furthermore, the Group’s business is not dependent on any patent or licence
agreement.

**_8.1.1 THE TREATY OF CANTERBURY_**

The principal purpose of the Treaty of Canterbury is to authorise the construction and operation of the Fixed Link by private
concessionaire companies, without any government funds.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Canterbury, the States guarantee FM and CTG, as Concessionaires, under national and
EU law, freedom to determine their commercial policy, tariffs and the nature of the services they offer to customers.

The Treaty of Canterbury also includes various other provisions relating to the Fixed Link such as:

   the establishment of the IGC, to deal with all issues relating to the construction and operation of the Fixed Link in the
name of the States and by express delegation of their authority;

   the establishment of the Safety Authority to advise and assist the IGC on all issues relating to the safety of the
construction and operation of the Fixed Link. The Safety Authority also assists in drawing up regulations applicable to
the safety of the Fixed Link and monitors compliance of such regulations with applicable national or international rules
and regulations. The members of the Safety Authority are appointed on an equal basis by each of the States;

   the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to settle disputes between the States and the Concessionaires relating to the
Concession Agreement;

   the taxation by the two States of profits and revenues generated by the construction and operation of the Fixed Link is
governed by applicable legislation, including any double taxation treaties for the prevention of tax evasion in force
between the two States and relating to direct taxes, together with any related protocols;

   compliance by the two States with the principle of non-discrimination with respect to taxes relating to charges payable
by customers of other directly competing modes of crossing the Channel;

   the absence of any withholding tax by the two States on the transfer of funds and financial payments required for the
operation of the Fixed Link, either between the two States, or coming from or going to other countries, other than the
general taxation of payments represented by such transfers or financial payments; and

   the commitment of the States to cooperate in a number of areas, including defence, security, policing, border controls,
interpretation or application of the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement.

**_8.1.2 THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT_**

The Concession Agreement was signed on 14 March 1986 between the States and the Concessionaires, pursuant to the
Treaty of Canterbury.

Initially entered into for a period of 55 years, the Concession Agreement was extended by 10 years and then 34 years by
successive amendments dated, respectively, 29 June 1994 and 29 March 1999, duly ratified by legislative provisions in
France and the United Kingdom. The term of the Concession Agreement was therefore extended first from 55 to 65 years,
then from 65 to 99 years and expires in 2086.

Pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement, the Concessionaires have the right and the obligation, jointly and
severally, to design, finance, construct and operate the Fixed Link, and the Concessionaires do so at their own risk and
without any government funds or state guarantees regardless of the risks that may materialise during the performance of
the Concession Agreement. In particular, the Concessionaires are solely liable for any loss or damage caused to users of
the Fixed Link or third parties resulting from its operation.

Accordingly, the principal obligations of the Concessionaires under the Concession Agreement are:

   to operate and maintain the Fixed Link and employ all means necessary to permit the continuous and fluid flow of traffic
in safe and convenient conditions; and

   to comply with applicable laws and regulations in relation to the operation of the System and in particular in relation to
customs, immigration, security, sanitary and road transport controls and rescue services.


-----

###### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Fixed Link is an integrated transport system comprising shuttle services for road vehicles (for cars and trucks) and
railway network services (for passenger and rail freight trains) with no internal transactions between the two activities. The
principle of uniqueness of the Concession arises from article 2.2 of the Concession Agreement, which states that “[t]he Fixed
_Link shall include the ancillary installations, connections to the existing transport network and all plant, machinery, movable_
_and immovable equipment and railway shuttle rolling stock, necessary for safe and efficient operation between the_
_two terminals”._

Given the specific nature of the project and its financing, the Fixed Link has a special status. European Union Directive
2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway
area includes an exemption for the Group: article 2.9: “This Directive shall not apply to undertakings the business of which
_is limited to providing solely shuttle services for road vehicles through undersea tunnels or to transport operations in the_
_form of shuttle services for road vehicles through such tunnels [. . .].” Directive 2016/2370/EU Directive of 4 December 2016_
(4th railway package) has confirmed the exemption for the Group’s Shuttle Services.

The activities of infrastructure management and Shuttle operations are legally and financially integrated. There is therefore
no intra-group flow on these activities to be reported.

**a)** **Tariffs and commercial policy**

The Concessionaires are free to set their fares. National laws relating to price and fare controls by public authorities do not
apply to the Fixed Link. However, these provisions are without prejudice to the application of national or EU rules relating to
competition and abuse of dominant positions. The Concessionaires must not discriminate between users of the Fixed Link,
in particular with respect to their nationality or direction of travel. They may however adjust tariffs in accordance with normal
commercial practices.

**b)** **Role of the IGC**

The IGC, established by the Treaty of Canterbury, was created to monitor, on behalf and with the authority of the States, all
issues relating to the construction and operation of the System. The IGC is made up of representatives of each of the States
on an equal basis.

The IGC acts as concession authority vis-à-vis the Group on behalf of and under the control of the States, and its duties in
this regard are:

to supervise the construction and operation of the System;

to take decisions on behalf of the States in relation to the performance of the Concession Agreement, including the right
to impose penalties on the Concessionaires in the event of a breach of their obligations under the Concession
Agreement;

to approve the proposals of the Safety Authority;

to prepare or participate in the preparation of all regulations applicable to the System and monitor their application,
including those in relation to maritime and environmental matters; and

to issue advice and recommendations concerning the States and the Concessionaires.

The functions of the independent railway control body for the economic regulation of the Fixed Link’s railway activities
provided for in the European Union Directive 2012/34 were conferred on ARAFER in France and its British counterpart, the
Office of Rail and Road (ORR). This transfer from the IGC to ARAFER and ORR was formalised by a binational regulation
dated 23 March 2015, which took effect on 15 June 2016 by virtue of the implementing decree of 6 July 2016.

A framework agreement has been entered into between the Concessionaires and the two States in the interests of the safety
of the Concession and good relations between the Concessionaires and the IGC. This agreement provides for the creation
of a fund to invest in safety operations and to promote research and development.

**c)** **Penalties**

Any failure by the Concessionaires to perform their obligations under the Concession Agreement shall entitle the States to
impose penalties, but no other measure under the Concession Agreement.

Should a breach be identified by the IGC, it would inform the Concessionaires in writing, specifying the nature and subject
of the breach. After the Concessionaires have been heard, the IGC may issue a formal notice to remedy the breach within
a sufficiently long period of time which may not be less than thirty days.

If at the end of such period, the Concessionaires have not remedied the breach identified by the IGC, it may impose a
penalty on the basis of a fixed initial daily sum of between 10,000 and 100,000 ecus at 1986 values (changed to euros at a
rate of one to one on 1 January 1999) and proportionate to the seriousness of the breach giving rise to the penalty.

**d)** **Early termination of the Concession Agreement and compensation**

Each party to the Concession Agreement may request the arbitration tribunal, established pursuant to the Treaty of
Canterbury, to declare the termination of the Concession Agreement in exceptional circumstances, such as war, invasion,
nuclear explosion or natural disaster. In such cases, in principle, no compensation is owed to the Concessionaires. However,
the States may pay the Concessionaires an amount representing the financial benefits, if any, that they may derive from
such termination.


-----

###### 1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Each of the States may terminate the Concession for reasons of national defence. In such case, the Concessionaires may
claim compensation under the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Canterbury. The Treaty of Canterbury specifies that
such compensation shall be governed by the law of the relevant State.

Each of the States may terminate the Concession Agreement in the event of a fault committed by the Concessionaires. The
Concession Agreement defines a fault as a breach of a particularly serious nature of the obligations under the Concession
Agreement or ceasing to operate the Fixed Link. The States may issue a formal notice to the Concessionaires giving them
a period of three months, which may be extended up to a maximum period of six months, to remedy the breach. This formal
notice is also sent to the lenders that financed the construction and operation of the Fixed Link. If, within such period, the
Concessionaires have not remedied the breaches complained of, the States may terminate the Concession Agreement,
subject to giving prior notice to the lenders of their right of substitution.

Any termination of the Concession Agreement by the States, other than in a situation described above, gives the
Concessionaires the right to payment of compensation. Such compensation shall be for the entire direct and certain loss
actually suffered by the Concessionaires and attributable to the States, within the limits of what can reasonably be estimated
at the date of the termination, including the damage suffered and operating losses. To calculate this compensation, account
is taken of the share of liability of the Concessionaires, if any, in the events which led to the termination.

**e)** **Assignment and substitution by lenders**

The Concession Agreement provides that each of the Concessionaires has the right to transfer the Concession Agreement
or the rights it confers, with the agreement of the States.

In addition, upon the occurrence of one of the events set out below, and for as long as the effects of the event persist, or
any other action or intention that could lead to the termination of the Concession Agreement, the lenders, approved as such
by the States pursuant to the Concession Agreement (the “Lenders”) may request of the States that substitution be operated
in favour of entities controlled by them (referred to as the “Substituted Entities” in the Concession Agreement) if:

(i) the Concessionaires fail to pay, within a contractual grace period, any sum due and payable under the terms of the
finance documents,

(ii) the Concessionaires do not have and cannot procure sufficient funds to finance the forecasted operating costs of the
Fixed Link, and the related finance charges,

(iii) it appears that the date of full and final payment of all receivables of the Lenders must be postponed for a significant

length of time, or

(iv) in the event of the Fixed Link being abandoned, insolvency, liquidation, enforcement of security by other creditors and

related events.

The Substituted Entities must prove to the States, at the time of the substitution, that they have sufficient technical and
financial capacity to continue performance of the Concession Agreement.

The amendment to the Concession Agreement dated 29 March 1999 granted an extension to the term of the Concession
Agreement for the sole benefit of the Concessionaires, such that the extension would not apply if the Lenders exercised
their Substitution Right.

In accordance with Article 32 of the Concession Agreement, the lenders of the Term Loan have been approved by the States
as Lenders able to benefit from the Substitution Right under the terms set out in the Concession Agreement.

**f)** **Taxation and sharing of profits**

Taxation and customs matters are decided by the States in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Canterbury. If it
appears that changes in tax or customs legislation have a discriminatory effect on the Fixed Link, the relevant State will
examine the issue with the Concessionaires. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 19 of the Concession Agreement, as
a matter of principle, the Concessionaires share equally between CTG and FM at cost price all expenses and all revenues
from the Fixed Link for the period during which they operate it. To this end, the consequences of any indirect taxation on the
supply of goods or services levied only on one of the Concessionaires will be taken into account in the costs to be shared.
Any equalising payment made between FM and CTG will be treated as a capital expense or a revenue payment as
determined by the tax legislation of the two States.

With respect to the period between 2052 and 2086, the Concessionaires will be obliged to pay to the States a total annual
sum, including all corporate taxes of any kind whatsoever, equal to 59% of all pre-tax profits.

**g)** **Litigation**

Disputes relating to the application of the Concession Agreement must be submitted to an arbitration tribunal which will
apply the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement. Provisions of French or English
law may, if necessary, be applied, if this is dictated by the performance of specific obligations under French or English law.
Relevant principles of international law and, if the parties so agree, the principles of equity may be applied.

**_8.1.3 RAILWAY USAGE CONTRACT_**

The Railway Usage Contract was entered into on 29 July 1987 between the Concessionaires and the BRB and SNCF rail
networks when the Treaty of Canterbury was ratified and the Concession came into force. It sets out the basis on which the
Concessionaires allow the trains using the Railways to use the Fixed Link, from the date the Railway Usage Contract came
into force until 2052. It also specifies the conditions under which the Railways undertake and are authorised to use the Fixed

###### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Link with arrangements for the development of certain services and the installation of certain railway infrastructure and the
rolling stock necessary to ensure a sufficient level and quality of traffic in the Tunnel. Likewise, the Concessionaires
subscribe to a number of commitments relating to maintenance of the Fixed Link. Pursuant to the Railway Usage Contract,
the Railways are authorised to use up to 50% of the capacity of the Fixed Link per hour and in each direction, up until 2052.

Under the terms of the Railway Usage Contract, the Railways are obliged to pay the Concessionaires variable charges
depending on the number of passengers travelling on passenger trains and the freight tonnage carried through the Fixed
Link, as well as fixed annual charges. Mechanisms to reduce the annual charges are set out in the event that the Fixed Link
is unavailable. Lastly, under the Railway Usage Contract, the Railways must pay a contribution to the Concessionaires’
operating costs and the renewal of the Fixed Link. To this end, the Railways make monthly provisional payments to the
Concessionaires against operating costs for the current period. Payments are subsequently adjusted to take account of real
operating costs, with the final amount of the contribution determined on the basis of the provisions set out in the Railway
Usage Contract, and agreements reached for its implementation.

The Railway Usage Contract is governed by French law.

In addition, the strategy for the re-launch of freight services offers a simplified pricing structure mechanism for goods trains,
with a toll per freight train rather than per tonne of freight, based on a charging regime published annually by Eurotunnel in
the Fixed Link Network Statement.

A substantial majority of the Group’s revenues emanating from its rail network (see chapter 1) is made up of the variable
charges and annual fixed charges referred to above.

In the context of the privatisation of the British railways, BRB entered into back-to-back contracts with certain entities,
including Network Rail, DB Cargo UK (formerly EWS and DB Schenker Rail UK) and Eurostar International Limited (formerly
Eurostar UK Limited), under the terms of which BRB delegated to those entities operational execution of some of its
obligations to the Concessionaires. As part of the agreement with the British and French governments regarding the
extension of the Concession Agreement until 2086, the Group undertook, under certain conditions, to work with the entities
to which execution of these obligations had been delegated, to ensure the development of passenger train services and
goods train services.

In accordance with EU directives governing the liberalisation of the international rail transport market, the Concessionaires
publish the Fixed Link Network Statement annually; this offers transparent and non-discriminatory conditions of access to
its rail network to all Railway Companies and the same tariff framework as that set out by the Railway Usage Contract.

**_8.1.4 THE TERM LOAN AND ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS_**

FM and CTG entered into the Term Loan dated 20 March 2007 (as amended and updated from time to time, most recently
on 6 June 2017), under which credit facilities in a principal amount of £1,836.5 million and €2,188 million (the “Senior
Facilities”) were made available to FM and CTG on 28 June 2007 by Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and Deutsche
Bank A.G. (London Branch) (together, the “Initial Lenders”). The financing of the Senior Facilities was arranged by Goldman
Sachs International and Deutsche Bank AG (London Branch) (the “Main Lenders”).

For the purposes of the management of the Senior Facilities, these loans were securitised on 20 August 2007 with Channel
Link Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF).

**a)** **Principal provisions of the Term Loan**

**Summary of the tranching and the financial conditions of the Term Loan**

The Senior Facilities consist of:

tranches A1, A2, A3 each denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate, indexed on inflation in the
United Kingdom;

tranches A4, A5, A6 each denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate, indexed on inflation in France;

a tranche B1 loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate;

a tranche B2 loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate;

a tranche C1A loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate, which will switch to a variable rate on 20
June 2029;

a tranche C1B loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate;

a tranche C2A loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate, which will switch to a variable rate on 20 June
2022;

a tranche C2B loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate, which will switch to a variable rate on 20 June
2027;

a tranche C2C loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate; and

a tranche C2D loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate.

The C tranches, bearing interest at a variable rate, are hedged as indicated in the paragraph “Hedging arrangements in
respect of the Term Loan” below.

The weighted average interest rate applicable to the Senior Facilities and payments relating to the servicing of debt under
the Term Loan, are detailed in notes G.1.1 and G.8.2 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this
Registration Document.


-----

###### 1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The borrowings denominated in sterling have been made available to CTG and those in euros have been made available
to FM.

**Repayment of the Term Loan**

The funds borrowed under the Term Loan will be repayable in accordance with their respective repayment schedules.

Repayment of the A tranche loans will begin 11 years after the start of availability of such loans and will be completed at
least 35 years after the date of signature of the Term Loan.

Repayment of the tranche B1 and B2 loans began in 2013, six years after the date on which the Term Loan was signed.

Repayment of the tranche C1 and C2 loans will begin 39 and 34 years respectively after the date on which such loans
become available and be completed in June 2050.

**Prepayment of the Term Loan**

The amounts borrowed under the Senior Facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at the instigation of the relevant borrower,
subject to the payment of certain market standard prepayment premia.

The amounts borrowed under the Senior Facilities may also be subject to mandatory prepayment, under certain conditions
and in certain proportions, in particular from funds arising from insurance proceeds, permitted asset transfers, expropriation
of such assets, compensation under the Concession Agreement and, in certain instances, excess cash flow.

If the Group does not meet certain financial targets, excess cash flow must (i) during the first years following drawdown on
the Senior Facilities, be paid into a secured account set up for prepayment of amounts lent under the Senior Facilities and
(ii) subsequently be used directly for such prepayment until the Group once again meets the above mentioned financial
targets.

**Undertakings and prohibitions under the Term Loan**

The Term Loan includes certain undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for a loan of its nature, in particular
restrictions relating to:

   the creation or maintenance of liens on the assets of the Group;

   the sale or transfer of Group assets and the acquisition by the Group of new assets;

   the granting of loans, securities or guarantees for the benefit of third parties; and

   the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent under the Term Loan, including inter alia the Railway
Usage Contract.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan, the Group is required to meet the following financial covenants: at each
reference date, the debt-service coverage ratio must not be less than 1.10 since 28 June 2012. For the purposes of this test,
the ratio is calculated, on a rolling 12-month period, on a consolidated basis taking into account (i) as regards the calculation
of available cash flow for the servicing of debt, the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the Senior Facilities, and
(ii) as regards the calculation of debt servicing, the Group. GET SE has respected the debt-service coverage ratio for 2017.

While the Term Loan restricts any increase in the financial indebtedness of the Group, it permits, amongst other items, (i) the
borrowing of revolving facilities, bonding facilities or guarantee facilities up to a maximum amount of €75 million (provided
that the relevant lender accedes to the Intercreditor Deed (as such term is defined in section “Agreement between Creditors”
below)) and (ii) indebtedness of up to £225 million of its Euro equivalent (provided that such indebtedness is unsecured and
structurally and (through the accession of the new lender(s) to the Intercreditor Deed) contractually subordinated to all
amounts payable under the Term Loan and that the ratings of the Term Loan are affirmed).

The Term Loan permits the Group to pay dividends, provided that such dividends are paid out of excess cash flow
(as defined in the Term Loan) or funds arising from a permitted disposal under the Term Loan (insofar as these funds do
not have to be allocated to mandatory prepayment) on the condition that no default is continuing under the Term Loan and
that the debt-service coverage ratio is not less than 1.25. For the purposes of this test, the ratio is calculated on the basis of
a rolling 12-month period, on a consolidated basis, such consolidation to include (i) as regards the calculation of available
cash flow for the servicing of debt, the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the Senior Facilities and (ii) as regards
the calculation of debt service, the Group (with amortisation being calculated by reference to the greater of (i) the hypothetical
amortisation of the loan based on an annuity and (ii) the contractual amortisation). Failure to meet this ratio on a six-monthly
testing date would not constitute an event of default but would lead to restrictions on the use of the Group’s excess available
cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the Term Loan until such time as the test is met once again. If these
conditions are not met on an interest repayment date in connection with the Term Loan, the excess cash flow and funds will
be placed into an account dedicated to so-called “capex” expenditure. Failure to meet this test on three consecutive
six-monthly testing dates would trigger a prepayment event, under which the Group’s excess available cash flow would have
to be used towards prepayment of the Term Loan until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again.

**Event of default and acceleration**

The Term Loan contains a number of events of default which, in certain instances subject to grace periods, enable the
lenders to declare the Term Loan immediately due and payable, to enforce the liens described below or to demand the start
of the substitution mechanism provided for under the terms of the Concession Agreement and described in section 8.1.2 of
this Registration Document.

The events of default include in particular:

   any failure to pay under the Term Loan;


-----

###### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

a failure to comply with any provision of the Term Loan, the Intercreditor Agreement or related documents. These
provisions impose limits relative to indebtedness, acquisitions, sales and other transfers, mergers, loans, guarantees
and the granting of new securities by the member companies of the Group, and include in particular:

(i) a financial commitment pursuant to which GET SE is obliged to ensure that at each half-yearly test date subsequent

to 31 December 2007, the ratio of cash flow from operational activities over the total cost of servicing the debt
resulting from the Senior Facilities is not below 1.10 since 28 June 2012, the said ratio being calculated by reference
to the twelve-month period preceding the date of the test; and

(ii) certain commitments related to the tax treatment of the Group and where non-compliance is reasonably likely to

substantially affect the financial situation of FM, CTG or the Group;

a declaration or statement made or deemed to have been made by a borrower or a guarantor in relation to the Term
Loan, or any other financial document related to it or any other document presented by or on behalf of a borrower or a
guarantor in relation to the said financial documents (which contain the declarations and statements that are usual for
this type of financing), which proves to have been erroneous or misleading at the time when it was made or deemed to
have been made;

the occurrence of a cross default under any other indebtedness (greater than a certain amount) of any of the companies
within the Group;

the inability of any borrower or guarantor to pay its debts as they fall due, the insolvency or the opening of any legal
proceedings in relation to any borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan;

the illegality or invalidity of the Term Loan, any related liens or the subordination created under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

the permanent impossibility of carrying on the business of operating the Tunnel, or the destruction of the Tunnel, or the
cessation of a substantial part of its activities by a borrower or a guarantor;

a guarantor ceases to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of GET SE;

any act or omission of France or the United Kingdom which renders a borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan
incapable of performing its obligations under the Term Loan and related documents; and

the occurrence of litigation (or similar proceedings) against any Group member company or its assets, which is
reasonably likely to be adversely determined against the relevant company and to have a substantial adverse effect on
the financial position of FM, CTG or the Group.

The Term Loan also includes other events of default that are usual for this type of funding.

**Hedging arrangements in respect of the Term Loan**

FM and CTG, prior to the drawdown under the Term Loan, entered into various hedging arrangements in order to hedge
their respective exposure to interest rate fluctuation in connection with their payment obligations under the Term Loan as
indicated in note G.1.1 to the consolidated accounts figuring in section 2.2.1 of this Registration Document.

**Agreement between Creditors**

Prior to drawdown under the Term Loan, the Group entered into an intercreditor deed with its bank lenders and its intra-group
creditors (the “Intercreditor Deed”) pursuant to which the claims of all intra-group creditors are subordinated to the claims of
the bank lenders.

The Intercreditor Deed also provides for the security and the guarantees described below to be held by a Security Trustee
for the benefit of the lenders under the Term Loan, and, as the case may be, for the benefit of lenders under certain permitted
financial indebtedness acceding to the Intercreditor Deed.

**b)** **Guarantees and security relating to the Term Loan**

**Guarantees**

Under the Intercreditor Deed, GET SE, FM, EFL, CTG, ESGIE, Eurotunnel SE, ESL, EurotunnelPlus Limited and Gamond
Insurance Company (the “Original Guarantors”) each jointly and severally guarantee the commitments made by FM and
CTG, in their capacity as borrowers under the Term Loan vis-à-vis the Initial Lenders, the arrangers, the Agents and the
hedging counterparties of the Term Loan. EGP, TNU SA and TNU PLC, each of which were Original Guarantors, have been
merged into GET SE, and EurotunnelPlus Distribution SAS, which was also an Original Guarantor, has been merged into
Eurotunnel SE.

The Term Loan provides that, following its execution, certain of the Group companies (other than the Original Guarantors)
will be required also to become guarantors of the Term Loan if, in particular, their contribution to the EBITDA, gross value
of assets or turnover of the Group increases above a specified pre-determined threshold.

In order to guarantee their obligations as borrowers under the Term Loan and guarantors under the Intercreditor Deed, the
Initial Guarantors have given various securities.

**Security granted by the Group under French law**

To secure their obligations as borrower under the Term Loan or guarantor under the Intercreditor Deed, the Initial Guarantors
owning French assets have granted the following security:

i) assignment of trade receivables by way of guarantee under which (i) FM assigns its receivables under the Concession
Agreement and the Railway Usage Contract as well as its trade receivables owed by the freight transporters and coach

###### 1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

operators and its insurance receivables and intercompany receivables held by it on the French subsidiaries of the
Group, (ii) CTG assigns the same categories of receivables as FM with the exception of its trade receivables owed by
the freight transporters and coach operators, and (iii) other members of the Group qualifying as guarantor assign their
insurance receivables and intercompany receivables held against French companies of the Group;

ii) unregistered mortgages over FM’s and CTG’s main real estate assets that are not the subject of short- or medium-term
development projects;

iii) a non-possessory lien over FM’s rolling stock;

iv) a pledge on all bank and investment accounts open in France in the name of any borrower or guarantor under the
Term Loan;

v) a pledge on shares in the Group members held by the borrowers or guarantors under the Term Loan;

vi) a pledge on the main Group trademarks;

vii) a pledge on receivables held by FM under certain pieces of land comprised in the “ZAC 1” and which is the subject of
long-term construction leases (baux à construction);

viii) a pledge on receivables held by GET SE against FM pursuant to the bonds facility agreement dated 28 June 2007 (as

amended on 29 August 2007) and entered into, inter alia, GET SE as lender and FM as borrower; and

ix) a pledge over their rights held in connection with the economic interest grouping (groupement d’intérêt économique or
GIE) by GET SE, FM, CTG and Eurotunnel SE.

**Security granted by the Group under English law**

To secure their obligations as borrower under the Term Loan or guarantor under the Intercreditor Deed, the Initial Guarantors
have each granted security over all of their assets held at the date of execution of the Term Loan as well as over their
future assets.

**Security over the other assets of the Group**

All of the shares of members of the Group that are not subject to security as described above (with the exception of Europorte
SAS and its subsidiaries) have been pledged by way of security for the obligations of the borrowers under the Term Loan
and guarantors under the Intercreditor Deed.

**_8.1.5 MASTER INTRA-GROUP DEBT AGREEMENT_**

Intra-group debts existed between the various companies of the Group. Some of them were expressed in contracts
concluded between 2007 and 2009 for the financial restructuring or simplification of the structure of the Group (“Intra-Group
Debts”). Certain of these Intra-Group Debts for which contracts were concluded in 2007 were reorganised in 2009 as part
of the transactions prior to the merger of TNU SA into GET SE which gave rise to the conclusion of new contracts for
intra-group loans.

The Intra-Group Debts, because they were concluded over a period from 2007 to 2009 and partly re-organised in 2009, had
different characteristics as to interest rate and maturity which complicated the financial and accounting management of
Group companies.

Group companies have therefore concluded a contract entitled the “Master Intra-Group Debt Agreement” the principal object
of which is the harmonisation of (i) the rules for current accounts between Group companies, (ii) the interest rates of the
various Intra-Group Debts and (iii) where possible, the other conditions of these Intra-Group Debts in order to facilitate the
financial and accounting management of Group companies and to reflect the financial policy between the Group’s
companies.

**8.2** **CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENT AND BY-LAWS**

GET SE is governed by the French law provisions relating to sociétés anonymes with a board of directors, compatible with
the SE regulations.

**_8.2.1 CORPORATE PURPOSE (ARTICLE 2 OF GET SE’S BY-LAWS)_**

The corporate purpose of GET SE is:

   acquire equity interests by way of the purchase, subscription, transfer or exchange of corporate rights, shares,
partnership interests or otherwise, with any co-contracting party, French or foreign, in any company whose purpose is
directly or indirectly related to the operation of the Tunnel between France and the United Kingdom or any other fixed
links, infrastructure or transport activities;

   participate in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, in any transactions connected with its corporate purpose via
the creation of new companies, the contribution, subscription or purchase of securities or corporate rights, merger or
otherwise, creation, acquisition, leasing, lease management of all businesses or establishments; taking, acquiring,
operating or selling any procedures or patents relating to its activities;

   generally, all industrial, commercial, financial, civil, personal or real property transactions, directly or indirectly related to
any of the purposes referred to above or any similar or connected purposes, including in particular, any transport
business.


-----

###### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

**_8.2.2 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHED TO THE SHARES (ARTICLE 11 OF GET SE’S BY-LAWS)_**

Ownership of one ordinary share implies acceptance of the terms of the by-laws of GET SE and of all decisions taken by
GET SE shareholders in general meetings.

**Shares (ordinary shares)**

In addition to voting rights, each ordinary share grants the right to a share in the ownership of the company’s assets, profits
and liquidation proceeds, in proportion to the fraction of the share capital that it represents.

**Class B preference shares**

The 14[th] resolution of the general meeting of 29 April 2014 authorised the creation of class B preference shares, convertible
at the end of a period of four years into ordinary shares if market performance conditions of the ordinary shares are met.
Class B preference shares will be vested after a period of two years (29 April 2016) for the French scheme and four years
for beneficiaries who are not French tax residents (29 April 2018).

Class B preference shares may be converted into ordinary shares, depending on the evolution of the average market price
of the GET SE ordinary shares at the conversion date, and the average market price at the grant date, determined by
reference to the higher value of the following averages:

the average of the six months, according to the Board’s decision, preceding the date of grant or conversion;

the average repurchase price of ordinary shares held in treasury by the company at the date of grant or conversion,
pursuant to articles L. 225-208 and L. 225-209 of the French Commercial Code.

The average market price at the grant date was €8.17. The conversion ratio will be a maximum of 5,000 ordinary shares per
class B preference share for a target objective 100% met, with a tapering scale corresponding to the percentage of the
objective met and set such that, as appropriate, the entire amount of ordinary shares may be allocated.

The target objective for the market price of GET SE ordinary shares on the conversion date, calculated according to the
above terms, is set at €11.50.

Class B preference shares will have a nominal value of €0.01. They carry no voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary
general meetings of holders of ordinary shares, although they carry voting rights at special general meetings of holders of
the class B preference shares. Holders of class B preference shares meet at a special meeting for any proposed modification
to the rights attached to class B preference shares. Moreover, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 228-17 of the
French Commercial Code, any company merger or spinoff plans pursuant to which class B preference shares cannot be
exchanged for shares carrying specific equivalent rights will be subject to approval by any special general meeting
concerned.

Class B preference shares issue entitlement to only 1/5,000[th] of the amount of any distribution or, where applicable, asset
sharing, decided to the benefit of each ordinary share. They have no preferential subscription rights in any rights issue or
operations with rights to ordinary shares; the conversion ratio, however, may be adjusted so as to maintain the rights of
holders of class B preference shares, in accordance with legal and regulatory conditions, as stated in article 37 of the
company’s by-laws. With respect to ownership of assets, class B preference shares issue entitlement to the proceeds of
liquidation in proportion to the amount of share capital they represent.

**Class C preference shares**

The 12[th] resolution of the general meeting of 29 April 2015 authorised the creation of class C preference shares, convertible
at the end of a period of four years to ordinary shares if performance conditions are met.

The definitive grant of the class C preference shares is subject to an over-performance condition of EBITDA for 2015 and
2016 as compared to the published objectives for the relevant year with no grant when the achievement is below 100% of
the objectives. The number of class C preference shares is fixed on basis of the level of over-performance of the objectives
without exceeding a total number of 2,000 class C preference shares. Allocation of class C preference shares to
beneficiaries will be definitive after a vesting period of two years (ending on 29 April 2017), and beneficiaries must keep
these shares for two years following their definitive allocation. For beneficiaries who are not resident in France for tax
purposes, class C preference shares will be converted after the period of four years stipulated in the free share
allocation plan.

Class C preference shares will have a nominal value of €0.01. They will not grant any voting rights at general meetings of
the holders of ordinary shares, although the holders of class C preference shares will be entitled to attend a special meeting
in the event of any amendments to the rights attached to this category of shares.

Each class C preference share will have distribution rights equal to 1/5,000[th] of distribution rights and, in the event of
dissolution of GET SE, rights to the proceeds of liquidation in proportion to the nominal amount represented in share capital.
Class C preference shares will have no preferential subscription rights for rights issues or operations with rights to ordinary
shares, although the conversion ratio will be adjusted to maintain the rights of holders, in accordance with the legal,
regulatory and contractual conditions.

Class C preference shares will be converted into ordinary shares on the basis of the conversion ratio, determined on the
basis of the level of achievement of a performance condition calculated at the end of a four year period, from the date of
allocation of the class C preference shares by the Board, as a mean of the achievement for the following three criteria:

average percentage of over performance of the EBITDA for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as compared with the objective
announced to the market for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (70%);

average percentage of GET ordinary shares (with dividends) over performance as compared with Dow Jones
Infrastructure Index for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (20%);


-----

###### 1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   average rate of achievement of the CSR composite index for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (10%).

Subject to any adjustment in accordance with legal and regulatory conditions, the class C preference shares conversion
ratio will be a maximum of 500 shares for each class C preference share, for a maximum over-performance of 115% and
135 ordinary shares when the objectives have been 100% achieved, with a scale by step so that no class C preference
shares will be converted into ordinary shares in the event of any percentage achievement below 100% of the target objective.
After a period of four years, class C preference shares will either be converted into ordinary shares according to the
conversion ratio or, if the performance conditions have not been met, purchased by GET SE at their nominal value, in order
to cancel them.

**Class D preference shares**

The creation of preference shares (class D preference shares) convertible into ordinary shares will be the subject of a vote
at the General Meeting of 18 April 2018.

**_8.2.3 ALLOCATION OF PROFITS (ARTICLE 31 OF GET SE’S BY-LAWS)_**

The following deductions are made from the profits of each financial year, minus any prior losses, in the order set out below:

   at least 5% to constitute the reserve account required by law;

   the amounts determined by the general meeting to constitute such reserves for which it determines the distribution and
use; and

   the amounts that the general meeting decides to carry forward.

The balance, if any, shall be distributed among all of the shareholders in proportion to the number of ordinary shares held
by each of them.

If the balance sheet prepared during or at the end of the financial year and certified by the statutory auditors indicates that
GET SE, since the end of the previous financial year, after any necessary depreciation and reserves and after deducting
any previous losses and amounts required to constitute the necessary reserves pursuant to applicable laws or the by-laws,
has made a profit, interim dividends may be distributed before the accounts for the financial year have been approved. The
amount of the interim dividend may not exceed the amount of profit as defined above.

The conditions for the payment of dividends in cash are set by the shareholders’ general meeting, or failing that, by the
Board. Each class B and class C preference share will have one distribution right equal to 1/5,000[th] of distribution right and,
in the event of dissolution of GET SE, one right to the liquidation proceeds in proportion to the share that its nominal amount
represent in share capital.

Payment of dividends in cash must be carried out within a maximum period of nine months following the end of the financial

###### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

**Representation at general meetings (article 27 of GET SE’s by-laws and articles L. 225-106 et seq. of the French**
**Commercial Code)**

Pursuant to articles L. 225-106 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, shareholders may be represented at meetings by
the individual or legal entity of their choice under the conditions stipulated in current regulations. The proxy must prove his
authority in accordance with article L. 225-106 of the French Commercial Code. He is bound by the disclosure obligations
stipulated in current regulations. In addition, owners of securities referred to in the 3rd paragraph of article L. 228-1 of the
French Commercial Code may be represented by a registered intermediary in accordance with the provisions of
article L. 228-3-2 of the French Commercial Code.

Legal representatives of shareholders without legal capacity and individuals representing corporate shareholders may
participate in general meetings, whether or not they are shareholders.

Authority to act as a proxy may be given for one meeting only and shall be in respect of the agenda of that meeting only.
The authorisation must specify the meeting for which it is granted and provide necessary information to identify the ordinary
shares. Authority may however be given for two meetings, one ordinary and the other extraordinary, held on the same day
or within a period of fifteen days. The authority given for one meeting shall be valid for all successive meetings convened
with the same agenda. The proxy named in person on the proxy form may not substitute any other person.

All documents required by applicable laws and regulations must be attached to all proxy forms sent to shareholders.

The proxy form must be signed by the shareholder being represented and provide the last name, the first name, the address,
the number of ordinary shares owned and the number of votes attached to those ordinary shares. Only proxy forms which
have been received two days prior to the meeting will be taken into account by GET SE.

The intermediary referred to in article L. 228-1 of the French Commercial Code may, pursuant to a securities management
general mandate, send votes or powers of attorney on behalf of a shareholder as defined in article L. 228-1 of the French
Commercial Code for the purposes of a general meeting.

**Exercise of voting rights (article 27 of GET SE’s by-laws)**

All shareholders may vote by postal ballot under the conditions and within the time limits provided for by law by using a form
prepared by GET SE and sent to shareholders requesting the form and provided such forms reach GET SE two days prior
to the general meeting.

**Chairmanship of general meetings (article 27 of GET SE’s by-laws)**

General meetings of shareholders are chaired by the Chairman of the Board or, in his absence, by the most senior Director
present at the meeting. If the meeting has been convened by the statutory auditors, provisional liquidator or receivers, the
general meeting shall be chaired by the person, or one of those persons, who called the meeting.

**Quorum and majority at general meetings (articles 28 and 29 of GET SE’s by-laws)**

Ordinary, extraordinary, combined or special general meetings shall be subject to the quorum and majority conditions
provided by applicable laws and regulations governing such meetings and shall exercise the powers conferred on them by
law. The votes cast do not include those relating to ordinary shares for which the shareholder has not taken part in the vote
or has abstained or voted blank or invalid.

**Voting rights of holders of ordinary shares and double voting rights (article 11 of GET SE’s by-laws)**

Subject to the provisions set forth below, each member of a general meeting is entitled to as many voting rights and to cast
as many votes as the number of fully paid-up ordinary shares he owns or is representing.

However, each fully paid-up ordinary share which has been held by the same shareholder in registered form for two years
will carry a double voting right in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

In the event of a share capital increase by incorporation of reserves, profits or share premiums, this double voting right is
conferred from their date of issue to ordinary shares held in registered form and allocated for free to a shareholder by virtue
of the existing ordinary shares from which he derived this right.

A merger or demerger of GET SE has no effect on the double voting right that may be exercised at shareholder meetings
of the surviving companies if the by-laws of such companies so provide.

Any ordinary share converted into bearer form or which is transferred shall lose the double voting right conferred on it as
described in the preceding three paragraphs. However, the double voting right is not lost and the time proceeds are not
affected by a transfer by inheritance, liquidation of assets held jointly by spouses or inter vivos gifts in favour of a spouse or
relative entitled to inherit.

**Voting rights of holders of class B or C preference shares (article 11 of GET SE’s by-laws)**

Class B and C preference shares do grant any voting rights at general meetings of the holders of ordinary shares; however,
the holders of class B and C preference shares will be entitled to attend a special meeting, in the event of any amendments
to the rights attached to this category of shares.

**_8.2.5 CLAUSES THAT MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE CONTROL OF GET SE_**

There are no provisions in the by-laws that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of
GET SE.

###### Operating profit continues to improve

 The consolidated revenues for the Group in the first six months of 2018 reached €510 million, an increase of €18 million, or +4% compared to the first half of 2017.

 The Group’s operating costs have increased by €7 million for the six months. For the Fixed Link, charges increased by +4% to €203 million.

 The consolidated figures for the first six months show an increase of €11 million in EBITDA to €250 million.

 For the Fixed Link, this is the 9[th] consecutive first-half of the year when EBITDA has increased, +4% to €247 million.

 We should remember that revenues and operating profit remain characterised by the strong seasonality across the year and that these first-half results cannot be extrapolated across the full year.

 Net finance costs increased slightly (+€3 million) in the first six months of 2018, an increase due to the impact of the increase in British and French inflation on the cost of the indexed tranches of the debt. 

 In the first half of 2018, the Group’s net consolidated result was a profit of €39 million, an increase of +15%.

 The Free Cash Flow for the Group’s continuing activities has increased by +€2 million to €108 million in the first six months of 2018, compared to €106 million in the first half of 2017.

 OUTLOOK

 Looking towards 2022, the Group remains confident in its capacity to generate sustainable growth and continues to expect growth in its EBITDA. The Group reconfirms its outlook for the medium term:

 2018 Objectives:

 • EBITDA: €545 million at an exchange rate of £1=€1.14

 • Dividend 2018: €0.35 per share

 Outlook for 2022:

 • EBITDA: above €735 million (at least +38%)

 • Free Cash Flow: c.€400 million (approx. +70%)

 • Annual increase in dividend: +€0.05 per share

###### Half year activity report


###### HALF-YEAR ACTIVITY REPORT AT 30 JUNE 2018


###### ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT

To enable a better comparison between the two periods, the consolidated income statement for the first half of 2017
presented in this half-year activity report has been recalculated at the exchange rate used for the 2018 half-year income
statement of £1=€1.136.

In the first half of 2018, the Group’s consolidated revenues amounted to €510 million, an increase of €18 million (4%)
compared to 2017. Operating costs totalled €260 million, an increase of €7 million (3%) compared to 2017. EBITDA improved
by €11 million (5%) to €250 million and the trading profit improved by €10 million to €173 million. At €170 million, the operating
profit for the first six months of 2018 was up by €13 million compared to 2017. Net finance costs increased by €3 million
mainly as a result of the impact of higher British and French inflation rates on the index-linked tranches of the debt. The pretax result for the Group’s continuing operations for the first half of 2018 was a profit of €36 million, an increase of €1 million
compared to 2017 restated.

After taking into account a net tax income of €3 million, the net result for the continuing activities of the Group was a profit
of €39 million compared to a profit of €29 million in 2017. The Group’s net consolidated result for the first six months of 2018
was a profit of €39 million compared to a profit of €34 million in 2017.

###### 1 FIXED LINK SEGMENT

The Group’s core business is the Channel Tunnel Fixed Link Concession which operates and directly markets its Shuttle
Services and also provides access, on payment of a toll, for the circulation of High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar) and
the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Trains through its Railway Network. As stated in note D.1 to the half-year consolidated
financial statements at 30 June 2018, as the corporate reorganisation as described in note A.1 to the consolidated half-year
financial statements at 30 June 2018 has only recently been put in place, the separation between the Eurotunnel and Getlink
segments has not been presented in this half-year financial report. Therefore the Group’s corporate services are included
in the Fixed Link segment as previously.

###### Half-year activity report

Shuttle Services’ revenue for the first half of 2018 amounted to €296 million, up 5% compared to the previous year due to
an increase in yields which continue to benefit from the Group’s strategy of optimising the profitability of its Shuttle business
through its dynamic pricing policy for both truck and passenger traffic.

**Truck Shuttle**

The Truck Shuttle service increased its share of the Short Straits cross-Channel truck market from 39.2% for the first half of
2017 to 40.9% for the first half of 2018. The number of vehicles carried increased by 2.7% to 845,132 trucks which represents
a record for a first half of the year.

**Passenger Shuttle**

With growth traffic of 2.2% in the first half of 2018, the market share of the Passenger Shuttle’s car activity remained relatively
stable at 57.6%.

The Passenger Shuttle’s coach market share for the first half of 2018 increased by one point compared to the previous year,
to 41.0%.

_Brussels-Calais, Brussels-Lille, Brussels-Amsterdam, etc.)._
_**_ _Rail freight services by train operators (DB Cargo for BRB, SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Rail Operations Group, RailAdventure and Europorte)_
_using the Tunnel._

The Group earned revenues of €147 million in the first half of 2018 from the use of its Railway Network by Eurostar’s HighSpeed Passenger Trains and by the Train Operators’ Rail Freight Services, up 2% compared to 2017. Revenues generated
by both Eurostar and rail freight trains were impacted by the series of SNCF strikes in France during April, May and June
2018.

Despite being impacted by the SNCF strikes, the 5,198,821 Eurostar passengers that used the Tunnel in the first half of
2018 represented a record first-half, with June being the second best month ever. This growth of 3% compared to the
previous year was across all destinations and was boosted by the start of direct services from London to Amsterdam on 4
April 2018.

In the first half of 2018, cross-Channel rail freight recorded a growth of 2% in the number of trains compared to the same
period in 2017. After a first quarter with 6% growth and well set to continue like this with the launch of two new cross-Channel
rail freight services to Italy and Germany and the new Silk Road service, the second quarter was affected by the SNCF
strikes and fell by 3%.

The impact on Railway Network revenue of the SNCF strikes in the first half of 2018 is estimated at €2.9 million.

**1.2** **FIXED LINK OPERATING COSTS**

Fixed Link’s operating costs amounted to €203 millions for the first half of 2018, up 4% compared to 2017. This increase of
€7 million was due mainly to increased activity and maintenance costs as well as to increased electricity costs and UK
business rates, partially offset by the impact on the period of credits from EDF energy savings certificates in relation to
operation of the new Truck Shuttles amounting to €4 million.

 2 EUROPORTE SEGMENT

The Europorte segment covers the entire rail freight transport logistics chain in France and includes Europorte France and
Socorail.

Despite the SNCF strikes that had a significant impact on Europorte’s activities during the second quarter of 2018,
Europorte’s revenues and EBITDA for the first half of 2018 increased by €1 million compared to 2017. The results for the
period were driven by the contribution of new business and increased activity, particularly in the petrochemical sector and
by the continued strategy to sustainably reinforce Europorte’s profitability. The impact of the SNCF strikes on revenue and
EBITDA is estimated at €1.6 million for the first half of 2018.

###### 3 ELECLINK SEGMENT

ElecLink’s activity is the construction and operation of a 1,000 MW electricity interconnector between the UK and France.
Construction works began in 2016 and the interconnector is expected to be in commercial operation at the beginning of
2020.

Costs directly attributable to the project are capitalised. During the first half of 2018, works continued to advance in
accordance with the schedule and investment in the project amounted to €116 million.

Operating costs for the first half of 2018 amounted to €1 million, at a similar level as in the first half of 2017.

_*_ _Restated at the rate of exchange used for the 2018 income statement (£1=€1.136)._

At €250 million in 2018, the Group’s operating margin improved by €11 million compared to 2017 (+5%) as a result of an
increase in revenue and control of costs. The series of SNCF strikes during the second quarter of 2018 impacted the EBITDA
of both the Fixed Link and Europorte segments by an estimated €4.5 million.

###### 5 OPERATING PROFIT (EBIT)

Depreciation charges increased by €1 million compared to the first half of 2017 to €77 million.

At €173 million in the first half of 2018, the trading profit improved by €10 million (+6%) compared to 2017.

After taking into account net other operating charges of €3 million (€6 million in 2017), the operating profit for the first six
months of 2018 was up by €13 million (+8%) compared to 2017, to €170 million.

###### Half year activity report

 6 NET FINANCIAL CHARGES

At €135 million for the first half of 2018, net finance costs increased by €3 million compared to 2017 at a constant exchange
rate. This increase was mainly as a result of the impact of the increase in inflation rates in the UK and France on the indexlinked tranches of the debt and of the loan for the acquisition of the inflation-linked bonds partially offset by the capitalisation
of interest on the financing of the ElecLink project.

Other net financial income of €1 million in the first half of 2018 include net exchange losses of €0.1 million (2017: net
exchange gains of €8 million) and a net income of €1 million on the bonds held by the Group (2017: €3 million).

###### 7 NET RESULT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

The Group’s pre-tax result for continuing operations for the first six months of 2018 was a profit of €36 million, up €1 million
compared to 2017 at a constant exchange rate.

After taking into account a net tax income of €3 million, the Group’s post-tax result for continuing operations for the first half
of 2018 was a profit of €39 million compared to a profit of €29 million in 2017.

###### 8 NET RESULT FROM DISCONTINUED ACTIVITIES

Information on discontinued activities is set out in note C.2 to the Group’s half-year consolidated financial statements as at
30 June 2018.

###### 9 NET CONSOLIDATED RESULT

The net consolidated result for the Group for the first half of the 2018 financial year was a profit of €39 million compared to
a profit of €34 million (restated at an equivalent exchange rate) for the same period in 2017.

The table above summarises the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2018 and 31 December
2017. The main elements and changes between the two dates, presented at the exchange rate for each period, are as
follows:

At 30 June 2018, “Fixed assets” include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounting to €5,964 million
for the Fixed Link segment, €512 million for the ElecLink segment and €79 million for the Europorte segment. The
increase between 31 December 2017 and 30 June 2018 results mainly from investments of €116 million in the ElecLink
project.

Other non-current assets at 30 June 2018 include the inflation-linked bonds acquired by the Group in February 2018
amounting to €336 million (see note A.2 to the half-year consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2018) and a
deferred tax asset of €218 million.

At 30 June 2018, “Cash and cash equivalents” amounted to €274 million after payment of the €160 million dividend, net
capital expenditure of €111 million, €126 million in debt service costs (interest, repayments and fees) and net payments
of €192 million in respect of the acquisition of the inflation-linked bonds (a total payment of €407 million for the purchase
of the bonds financed in part by a loan of €214 million).

Equity decreased by €137 million as a result of the €160 million dividend payment, the impact of the first-time application
of IFRS 9 on the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2018 (€22 million) and the purchase of treasury shares (€13 million)
partly offset by the recycling of the fair value of value on the hedging contracts (€18 million) and the net profit for the
period (€39 million).

Financial liabilities have increased by €222 million compared to 31 December 2017 as a result of the €214 million loan
to finance the acquisition of the inflation-linked bonds in February 2018, an increase of €30 million arising from fees and
the effect of inflation on the index-linked debt tranches of the Term Loan and €26 million for the impact of the first-time
application of IFRS 9 on the accounting value of the debt at 1 January 2018. These increases have been partially offset
by the contractual debt repayments of €39 million.

The valuation of the fair value of the interest rate derivatives liability increased by €3 million.

Other liabilities include €287 million of trade and other payables and provisions, as well as retirement liabilities of €75
million.

_Continuing activities_

At €271 million, net cash generated from trading by continuing operations in the first half of 2018 improved by €10 million
compared to the first half of 2017. This change is explained mainly by:

an increase of €9 million to €271 million for the Fixed Link’s activities (first half of 2017: €262 million),

Europorte’s trading cash flow remained stable at €1 million, and

ElecLink’s expenditure remained relatively stable at €1 million (first half of 2017: €2 million).

The €10 million reduction in “Other operating cash flows and taxation” is mainly due to a net increase in tax payments: net
payments of €6 million in the first half of 2018 compared to net receipts of €3 million in the first half of 2017.

At €111 million in the first half of 2018 (down by €57 million compared to the first half of 2017), net cash payments from
investing activities comprised mainly:

a net amount of €31 million relating to the Fixed Link (first half of 2017: €27 million). The main expenditure was €11
million on infrastructure, €8 million on rolling stock, €4 million for new Flexiplus lounges (the Folkestone lounge opened
18 May 2018), €3 million to improve service to customers on the terminals and €2 million on computing and digital
projects, and

payments of €79 million for the construction works on the ElecLink project (€140 million in the first half of 2017).

On 9 February 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of inflation-linked bonds (see notes A.2 and G.1 to the notes to
the half-year consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2018), which was financed in part by an external loan. This
transaction generated a net cash outflow of €192 million.

Other net financing payments in the first half of 2018 amounted to €298 million compared to €269 million in the first half of
2017. During 2018, cash flow from financing comprised:

debt service costs of €126 million:

   - €84 million of interest paid on the Term Loan and on other borrowings (€111 million in the first half of 2017, including
the associated hedging transactions before their partial termination in June 2017); the decrease in interest paid
results from the new financing conditions obtained from the debt restructuring in June 2017;

   - €39 million paid in respect of the scheduled repayments on the Term Loan and other borrowings (€17 million in the
first half of 2017), including €31 million in respect of the first repayments of tranche A of the debt, and

   - €4 million in relation to fees on the operation to simplify the debt completed at the end of 2015 (€3 million in the first
half of 2017).

€15 million paid in respect of the share buyback programme (€4 million in the first half of 2017),

€160 million paid in dividends (€139 million in the first half of 2017), and

net receipts of €3 million from the liquidity contract and interest received (€7 million in the first half of 2017, including €3
million on the floating rate notes held by the Group until June 2017).

**Free Cash Flow**

The Group defines its Free Cash Flow as net cash flow from operating activities less net cash flow from investing activities
(excluding the initial investment in new activities and the acquisition of shareholdings in subsidiary undertakings) and net
cash flow from financing activities relating to debt service plus interest received (on cash and cash equivalents and other
financial assets).

###### OTHER FINANCIAL INDICATORS

**Financial covenants**

Following the completion of the Group’s corporate reorganisation during the first half of 2018 (see note A.1 to the
consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2018), the debt service cover ratio is now based on the cash flows of the
Eurotunnel Holding SAS sub-group of companies only, being defined as their net operating cash flow less capital expenditure
and taxes compared to their debt service costs, calculated on a rolling 12 month basis. The synthetic debt service cover
ratio is calculated on the same basis but using a hypothetical amortisation on the Term Loan.

The ratios for the 12 months ending 30 June 2018 were 2.53 and 2.53 respectively and hence the financial covenants for
the period were respected.

**Net debt to EBITDA ratio**

The net debt to EBITDA ratio as defined by the Group in paragraph 2.1.4 of the 2017 Registration Document, is the ratio
between consolidated EBITDA and financial liabilities less the value of the inflation-linked notes and cash and cash
equivalents held by the Group. The Group does not consider it appropriate to publish this ratio when calculated on the basis
of the activity of a six month period. At 31 December 2017, the ratio was 7.1.

**EBITDA to finance cost ratio**

The ratio of the Group’s consolidated EBITDA to its finance costs (excluding interest received and indexation) as defined in
paragraph 2.1.4 of the 2017 Registration Document is 2.2 at 30 June 2018 (30 June 2017 restated: 2.2).

###### Half year activity report

 OUTLOOK

The Group's results for the first half of 2018 reflect the orientations adopted within the framework of the strategic plan. They
confirm the robustness of its business model focused on sustainable growth in its various business segments and on creating
value for its shareholders.

The results of the Shuttle business, with traffic growth of between 2 and 3% and revenue increasing by 5%, reflect the
strategy of optimising profitability through active management of prices, for both the truck and car activities.

This strategy, driven by an attractive commercial proposition based on quality of service and the digitalisation of processes,
is intended to generate continuous growth in Tunnel traffic whilst optimising margins. The Group’s investment policy serves
this strategy and, such as with the opening of the new Flexiplus lounge on the Folkestone terminal during the first half of the
year, the Group is continuing its targeted investments aimed at reinforcing service quality and modernising its infrastructure
and equipment.

Despite the SNCF strike during the period, passenger high-speed train traffic travelling through the Tunnel continued the
growth seen in 2017, and the launch in April 2018 of the new service between London and Amsterdam confirms the potential
for growth of the rail transport market between the UK and the Continent over and above existing services and destinations.

The Group remains very confident in the solidity of its Fixed Link business and in its potential for growth. The Fixed Link
continues to be, and will increasingly assert itself as, the principle choice for trade and movement of people between the UK
and continental Europe.

The Group is closely following the negotiations on the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, which, with the
recent publication of a white paper by the British Government, has entered an intense phase in the run-up to the effective
date of 29 March 2019. Since 2016, the Group has been in constant contact with the French and British authorities and
other stakeholders so as to be informed of potential changes to the framework for future cross-border controls and the
definition of technological options to facilitate them. As a private company, manager of its own infrastructure and with 25
years of experience in the management of change, the Group remains confident in its ability – once the arrangements have
been agreed between the parties – to deliver the solutions required to enable it to guarantee the fluidity of traffic through the
Tunnel and to reinforce its position as a vital link in the European economic landscape. It is to be remembered that under
the Treaty of Canterbury, the management of frontiers is the joint responsibility of the two States.

Europorte continues its strategy of prioritising the profitability of its operations and the quality of its services. Its performance
in the first half of the year, achieved despite the SNCF strikes, reinforces the Group’s objective of creating value in rail freight
in France through managed growth and a high quality of service.

The ElecLink project is progressing normally and is in line with both budget and timetable except for a small shift in the
deployment in the rail tunnel. The various studies and independent expert opinions requested by the IGC in order to give
authorisation for the installation of the cable will be completed and delivered in the next few weeks. The objective of a start
of operations at the beginning of 2020 remains valid.

Following the completion of its corporate reorganisation in April 2018, the Group continues to work on the optimisation of its
financing structure in order to minimise, as market conditions allow, the cost of its debt and to support its strategy to develop
its core businesses of infrastructure and transport activities. During the second half of 2018, the Group intends to refinance
the EASL external bank loan of £190 million.

With confidence in its future and in light of its first half results, the Group confirms its financial objective as published in its
2017 Registration Document of a consolidated EBITDA of €545 million in 2018 (on the basis of an exchange rate of £1=€1.14
and the current scope of consolidation)*.

The start of ElecLink operations in 2020 will enable a significant step change in the Group’s profitability. In total, in the
current context, the Group believes it should exceed an EBITDA of €735 million (at £1=€1.14) in 2022*.

The Group confirms its intention to continue with its policy of a regular growth in dividend payments to shareholders with a
target increase per share of €0.05 per year.

###### RISKS

The main risks and uncertainties that the Group may face in the remaining six months of the financial year are identified in
the “Risks and Controls” chapter (chapter 3) of the 2017 Registration Document, which contains a detailed description of
the risk factors to which the Group is exposed. However, other risks, not identified at the date of publication of this half-year
report, may exist.

###### RELATED PARTIES

In the first half of 2018, the Group did not have any related parties transactions as defined by IAS 24.

_*_ _These objectives are based on data, assumptions and estimates that are considered to be reasonable. They take particular account of the consequences of the geopolitical context_
_but are however liable to change or to be modified due to uncertainties related in particular to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment. Furthermore, the_
_materialisation of certain risks as described in chapter 3 “Risks and Controls” of the 2017 Registration Document could have an impact on the Group’s activities and its capacity to_
_achieve its objectives. The Group does not therefore make any commitments nor does it give any guarantee that the objectives will be met, and the forward looking information_
_contained in this chapter cannot be used to make a forecast of results._

###### Summary consolidated half year financial statements

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Getlink SE, formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE, is the Group’s consolidating entity. Its registered office is at 3 rue La Boétie,
75008 Paris, France and its shares are listed on Euronext Paris and on NYSE Euronext London, The term “Getlink SE”
refers to the holding company which is governed by French law. The term “Group” refers to Getlink SE and all its subsidiaries.

The main activities of the Group are the design, financing, construction and operation of the Fixed Link’s infrastructure and
transport system in accordance with the terms of the Concession (which will expire in 2086), the rail freight activity of the
Europorte segment as well as the construction and operation (expected for the beginning of 2020) of the 1,000 MW electricity
interconnector in the Tunnel by ElecLink. The maritime activity was discontinued in 2015 (see note C.2 below).

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements for 2018 were prepared under the responsibility of the Board of
Directors at its meeting held on 24 July 2018.

###### A. Important events

 A.1 Internal legal reorganisation of the Group

On 23 April 2018, the Group finalised the implementation of its corporate reorganisation. This internal reorganisation
concerned its main activity, that of the operation of the Fixed Link which is now in a distinct sub-group, separate from other
of the Group’s activities which are managed and financed independently from the Fixed Link activity. This releases
Getlink SE from its commitments as a guarantor under the Term Loan as described in section 8.1.4 of the 2017 Registration
Document and should also enable a more flexible funding structure to be put in place in future that is more suitable for the
Group’s development needs.

The reorganisation involved the transfer of the companies in Getlink SE’s Fixed Link sub-group (including the
Concessionaires, France Manche SA and Channel Tunnel Group Ltd) to Eurotunnel Holding SAS which is now the new
holding company for the Eurotunnel sub-group and the bearer of the obligations under the Term Loan which previously
resided with Getlink SE.

This reorganisation forms part of the Group’s long-term strategy to develop its core infrastructure and transport activities.

As this corporate reorganisation has only recently been put in place, it is not reflected in the segment information in note D.1
of the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2018, but it will be included in the annual consolidated financial
statements to 31 December 2018.

###### A.2 Acquisition of inflation-indexed bonds

On 9 February 2018, Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited (an English subsidiary of Getlink SE), completed the acquisition of
the Channel Link Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF) G2 bonds held by FMS.

The G2 bonds, which have a nominal value of £150 million and are indexed on UK inflation, were acquired for £359 million
which was financed in part by an external loan of £190 million and in part by the Group’s own funds.

The G2 bonds have been recognised as “Other financial assets” at their fair value at the date of acquisition of £302 million.

Information on the accounting treatment of the transaction is given in note D.4 and G.4 to the notes to the consolidated
financial statements at 30 June 2018.

###### A.3 ElecLink

ElecLink’s construction works continued to progress as planned during the period in terms of both cost and timetable.
Investment in the project during the first half of 2018 amounted to €116 million, bringing the total investment since the Group
took full control of ElecLink in 2016 to €355 million.

###### Summary half year consolidated financial statements

 B. Principles of preparation, main accounting policies and
 methods

 B.1 Statement of compliance

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union and applicable on that date. They have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34. Thus, they do not contain
all the information required for complete annual financial statements and must be read in conjunction with Getlink SE’s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.

###### B.2 Basis of preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements for Getlink SE and its subsidiaries are prepared as at 30 June.

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the principles of currency conversion
as defined in the 2017 annual financial statements as at 31 December 2017.

The average and closing exchange rates used in the preparation of the 2018 and 2017 half-year accounts and the 2017
annual accounts are as follows:

_€/£_ **30 June 2018** **30 June 2017** **31 December 2017**

Closing rate 1.129 1.137 1.127
Average rate 1.136 1.161 1.140

###### B.3 Changes in accounting standards as at 30 June 2018

The standards and interpretations used and described in the annual financial statements as at 31 December 2017 have
been supplemented by the standards, amendments and interpretations whose application is mandatory for financial years
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

**B.3.1 Texts adopted by the European Union whose application is compulsory**

The texts adopted by the European Union, the application of which is compulsory for financial years beginning on or after
1 January 2018, are as follows:

IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and its amendments;

IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”;

amendments to IFRS 4 “Application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 4”;

amendments to IFRS 2 “Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions”;

IAS 40 “Transfers of investment property”; and

interpretation IFRIC 22 “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration”.

The impact of the first-time application of IFRS 9 is set out in note G.1 below. The application of other texts has not had a
significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

**B.3.2 Texts adopted by the European Union but not yet mandatory**

IFRS 16 “Leases” will be mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Under this standard, all leases
other than short-term leases and those for low-value assets must be recognised in the lessee’s statement of financial
position, in the form of a right-of-use asset and in consideration of a financial debt. The Group currently presents operating
leases off-balance sheet. The analysis of the potential impact of this standard, which mainly concerns the Europorte
segment, is currently being finalised.

The Group does not intend to apply this standard in advance.

**B.3.3 Other texts and amendments published by the IASB but not approved by the European Union**

The following texts concerning accounting rules and methods specifically applied by the Group have not yet been approved
by the European Union:

interpretation IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”;

amendments to IAS 28 “Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures”;

amendments to IAS 19 “Defined Benefit Plans: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement”; and

amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 “Sales or contributions of assets between an investor and its associate/ joint
venture”.

The potential impact of these other texts will be assessed by the Group in subsequent years.

###### Summary consolidated half year financial statements

 B.4 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. The Group’s
management and Board of Directors periodically review its valuations and estimates based on their experience and various
other factors considered relevant for the determination of reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’
carrying value. Accordingly, the estimates underlying the preparation of half-year consolidated financial statements to 30
June 2018 have been established in the context of the decision by the UK to leave the European Union as described below.
Depending on the evolution of these assumptions, actual results may differ from current estimates.

The use of estimations concerns mainly the valuation of intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment (see note F),
the evaluation of the Group’s deferred tax situation (note I), the valuation of the Group’s retirement liabilities and certain
elements of the valuation of financial assets and liabilities (note G.5).

**Brexit: the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union**

Following the UK's decision to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016, formal negotiations between the UK government
and the European Commission on the terms and mechanisms of the exit which started on 19 June 2017, entered the second
phase in December 2017 and are continuing as of the closing date of these accounts.

During the first half of 2018, the Group has not noted any significant impact of this decision on its business but continues its
process of active monitoring and detailed follow-up of potential risks that may arise.

The Group has taken account of this situation in the determination of the principal estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of its consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2018 as set out above.

###### B.5 Seasonal variations

The revenue and the trading result generated in each reporting period are subject to seasonal variations over the year, in
particular for the Passenger Shuttle’s car activity during the peak summer season. Therefore the results for the first half of
the year cannot be extrapolated to the full year.

###### C. Scope of consolidation

 C.1 Changes in the scope of consolidation

The scope of consolidation at 30 June 2018 is the same as that at 31 December 2017.

###### C.2 Assets held for sale and discontinued operations

The net result per discontinued activity is as below:

**Maritime segment MyFerryLink**

The Group has applied IFRS 5 “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” to its maritime segment
since the ending of its maritime activity in the second half of 2015. In 2017, the Group sold its three ferries.

The Group is the subject of a number of legal claims following the cessation of its maritime activity for which provision has
been made amounting to €11 million as at 30 June 2018.

###### D. Operating data

 D.1 Segment information

As explained in note A.1 above, the Group put in place a new corporate structure during the first half of 2018, which splits
the old “Fixed Link” segment into two new segments: “Eurotunnel” and “Getlink”. The Group is therefore now organised
around the following four sectors, which correspond to the internal information reviewed and used by the main operational
decision makers (the Executive Committee):

the “Eurotunnel” segment, which includes the Concessionaires’ of the cross-Channel Fixed Link and their subsidiaries,

the “Europorte” segment, the main activity of which is that of rail freight operator,

the “ElecLink” segment, whose activity is the construction and operation of a 1,000 MW electricity interconnector running
through the Channel Tunnel, and

the “Getlink” segment which includes the Group’s corporate services and which, since the Group’s corporate
reorganisation, is reported separately from the Eurotunnel segment.

As the new organisation has only recently been put in place, the separation between the Eurotunnel and Getlink segments
is not presented in this note which uses the old segmentation that regroups Eurotunnel and Getlink in the Fixed Link
segment. The new organisation will be reflected in the annual consolidated financial statements to 31 December 2018.

On 18 April 2018, the general meeting of shareholders authorised the Board of Directors to grant to executives and senior
staff of Getlink SE and its subsidiaries preference shares (class D shares) with a nominal value of €0.01 each with no voting
rights which are convertible into Getlink SE ordinary shares subject to performance conditions at the end of a three-year
period. The total number of preference shares may not give the right to more than 1,500,000 ordinary shares of a nominal
value of €0.40 each. Under this scheme, the Board approved on 18 April 2018 the grant of 1,500 preference shares, each
convertible at the end of the period into a maximum of 1,000 ordinary shares.

_**_ _Amount at the exchange rate on 30 June 2018._

**Adjustment relating to IFRS 9 : Financial Instruments**

IFRS 9, which is applicable from 1 January 2018, establishes new principles for the classification and measurement of
financial assets and liabilities and notably modifies the treatment of debt restructurings which renegotiate debt.

The renegotiation of the A tranches of the Term Loan in December 2015 is the only one of the Group’s transactions which
requires retreatment in accordance with IFRS 9. In accordance with IAS 39, the debt was maintained in the balance sheet
with an adjustment of the effective interest rate and the spreading of the cash flow differential over the residual maturity of
the debt. In accordance with IFRS 9, this difference is now recognised in the income statement as at the renegotiation date.

Application of IFRS 9 is retrospective, by recognising the cumulative transition effect as an adjustment to opening debt and
equity at 1 January 2018. As a consequence, the restatement has the effect of increasing the carrying value of the Group’s
financial liabilities by approximately €26 million at 1 January 2018 through a reduction in opening retained earnings.

The other changes made by this new standard, in particular as regards the impairment of trade receivables and the treatment
of hedging contracts, did not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements as of 30 June 2018.

**EASL loan**

The line “EASL” loan in the table above of €214 million at 30 June 2018 corresponds to a bank loan of £190 million taken
out by the English Getlink SE subsidiary, Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited, as part of the transaction completed on 9
February 2018 to acquire the G2 loans (see note A.2 above).

This loan bears a variable rate of interest, initially at LIBOR +1% with a progressively increasing margin to 3% at its final
maturity on 30 November 2018.

**Hedging instruments**

In 2007, the Group put in place hedging contracts in place to cover its floating rate loans (tranches C1 and C2) in the form
of swaps for the same duration and for the same value (EURIBOR against a fixed rate of 4.90% and LIBOR against a fixed
rate of 5.26%). The nominal value of hedging swap is €953 million and £350 million.

These derivatives were partially terminated as part of the refinancing of tranche C in June 2017 as set out in note G.1.1.a)
of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017.

These derivatives have been measured at their fair value as a liability on the statement of financial position as follows:

**Acquisition of inflation-linked bonds**

As mentioned in notes A.2 and G.1 above, on 9 February 2018 Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited (an English subsidiary
of Getlink SE) completed the acquisition of the CLEF inflation-linked bonds held by FMS.

The G2 bonds have been recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of £302 million. The fair value of these
bonds on the date of their acquisition was determined by the Group using its own financial model and corroborated by
estimates provided by an external expert.

The bonds, which have a nominal value of £150 million and are indexed on UK inflation, correspond to the securitisation of
tranche A2 of the Group’s debt and have the same characteristics in terms of interest and maturity as the A2 tranche (see
note G.1 to the Group’s annual financial statements at 31 December 2017).

The difference of £49 million between the fair value of the bonds at their acquisition date and their purchase price, which
corresponds to the indemnity paid in respect of a contribution to the fees incurred by FMS, has been recorded in the income
statement in the first half of 2018 under “Other financial charges”. The provision of £48 million recorded at 31 December
2017 in respect of this indemnity was released on the acquisition of the G2 bonds (see note D.4 above).

The difference between the fair value of the G2 bonds at their acquisition date and their nominal value indexed at the same
date will be amortised to the income statement over the remaining term until their final maturity.

These summary half-year consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. Our role is to
express a conclusion on these financial statements based on our review.

**I. Conclusion on the financial statements**

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. A review of interim
financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters,
and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do
not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying summary halfyear consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 - standard
of the IFRSs as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw your attention to note “G.1 Financial liabilities - Adjustment relating to IFRS 9:
Financial Instruments” to the summary half-year consolidated financial statements related to the first application of IFRS 9
– Financial instruments.

**II. Specific verification**

We have also verified the information presented in the half-year management report on the summary half-year
consolidated financial statements subject to our review. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and
consistency with the summary half-year consolidated financial statements.
