###### Restrictions: The Offering Memorandum is being furnished in connection with an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. Nothing in this electronic transmission constitutes an offer of securities for sale in the United States. Any securities to be issued will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

 Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Additional Notes has led the manufacturers to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Additional Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Additional Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Additional Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Additional Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

 Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Additional Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Additional Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Additional Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Additional Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Additional Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer's target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

 The Additional Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU ("Insurance Distribution Directive"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

 Getlink SE (formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE), a European company regulated by French law incorporated in Paris, France, and governed by the relevant provisions of prevailing French and EU laws and regulations (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes offered hereby will be consolidated and treated as a single class with the Issuer’s €700.0 million 3.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Original Notes” and, together with the Additional Notes, the “Notes”) issued on 30 October 2020 and will be governed by the trust deed relating to the Original Notes dated as of 30 October 2020 (the “Original Trust Deed”), as supplemented by the supplemental trust deed to be dated as of the Additional Notes Issue Date (as defined below) (the “Supplemental Trust Deed”, and the Original Trust Deed so supplemented, the “Trust Deed”). The Additional Notes will have substantially the same terms and conditions in all respects as the Original Notes for all purposes of the Trust Deed, including, without limitation, with respect to payments of interest, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. The Additional Notes will share the same international securities identification number (“ISIN”) and common code (“Common Code”) as the Original Notes and will be fully fungible therewith. See “Book Entry; Delivery and Form” and “Listing and General Information.”


###### Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each 30 June and 30 December commencing on 30 December 2020. Interest on the Additional Notes will be deemed to accrue from (and including) 30 June 2021. The Notes will mature on 30 October 2025.

 The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after 30 October 2022, in each case, at the redemption prices set out in this Offering Memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). Prior to 30 October 2022, the Issuer will be entitled to redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. Prior to 30 October 2022, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, also redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings.

###### The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, senior obligations of the Issuer and will be secured by share pledges over two of the Issuer’s direct subsidiaries and a first ranking charge on the Debt Service Reserve Account (as defined herein), which together will constitute the Security (as defined herein). The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, ranked pari passu in right of payment with any of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future debt of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment thereto. The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such debt. The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt of subsidiaries of the Issuer.

###### CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 Certain statements in this Offering Memorandum are not historical facts and are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements appear in various locations, including, without limitation, in the sections entitled “Summary”, and “Risk Factors”, along with sections of Annex A entitled “Presentation of the Group and its Businesses”, “Results and Outlook” and “Risks and Controls” and the section of Annex B entitled “Half Year Activity Report at 30 June 2021”. The Group may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements in reports to shareholders and in other communications. In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking information that has been extracted from third-party sources. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the Group’s plans, expectations, projections, objectives, targets, goals, strategies, future events, future operating revenues or performance, capital expenditures, return on capital invested, operating margins, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, the Group’s competitive strengths and weaknesses, the Group’s business strategy, and the trends the Group anticipates in the industries and the political and legal environments in which the Group operates and other information that is not historical information.

 Words such as “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “target”, “potential”, “expect”, “intend”, “predict”, “project”, “could”, “should”, “may”, “will”, “plan”, “aim”, “seek” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

 The forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum are largely based on the Group’s expectations, which reflect estimates and assumptions made by the Group’s management. These estimates and assumptions reflect the Group’s best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other factors, some of which are discussed below. In addition, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. The Group cautions all readers that the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum are not guarantees of future performance, and the Group cannot assure any reader that such statements will be realised or the forward-looking events and circumstances will occur.

 By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, many of which are beyond the Group’s control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among other things, those listed in the section entitled “Risk Factors”, as well as those included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. You should be aware that a number of important factors could cause the Group’s actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors include those set out in Section 3.1 of Annex A and Section “Preparation of the Half-Year Financial Report in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic” of Annex B.

 These factors and the other factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and relevant sections of Annexes A and B are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum (including Annexes A and B) describe additional factors that could adversely affect the Group’s operating results, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Group to predict all such risks, nor can the Group assess the impact of all such risks on the Group’s business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

 Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this Offering Memorandum or, in respect of Annexes A and B, on the dates noted in the section entitled “Annexes and Documents Incorporated by Reference” above. Accordingly, the Group does not intend, and does not undertake any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements set forth in this Offering Memorandum or Annexes A or B. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Group or to persons acting on the Group’s behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum and/or Annexes A or B, as applicable. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

###### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA

 Historic Financial Information of the Group

 Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Group’s consolidated financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been extracted from the Annual Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements, as applicable. The English language translation of (i) the Annual Financial Statements is included, or incorporated by reference into, Annex A to this Offering Memorandum; and (ii) the Interim Financial Statements is included in Annex B to this Offering Memorandum, in each case as set out in further detail in “Annexes and Documents Incorporated by Reference”. The Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and have been audited by the Issuer’s Independent Accountants, as set forth in their relevant audit reports. The Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (Interim Financial Reporting) (“IAS 34”) and have been reviewed by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in their relevant review report.

 The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. For a description of the Group’s significant accounting policies, critical estimates, judgments and assumptions, see Note B to each set of Annual Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements. It also requires the Group’s management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial information are disclosed in the notes to the Annual Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements, as applicable, and financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

 This Offering Memorandum also includes certain financial information relating to the Group’s key performance indicators derived from the Annual Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements, as applicable.

 IFRS 16—Leases

 The Group opted for an early application of IFRS 16 from 1 January 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. In Note B.2.2 to the 2018 Annual Financial Statements, the Group provided a comprehensive disclosure of the impact of application of IFRS 16 on its operating results, financial position and cash flows.

 Under IFRS 16, the Group was required to change the way it accounted for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, which were off-balance-sheet. The application of this standard results, among other things, in the recognition as assets in the form of a right-of-use of the lease contracts in consideration for a leasing liability. Relevant assets under lease were locomotives and other rolling stock belonging to the Group’s Europorte segment and premises occupied by Europorte, Getlink and ElecLink segments, as well as service vehicles. The application of IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2018 resulted in a €39 million increase in the Group’s total liabilities and a €19 million increase in its EBITDA for FY 2018.

 Non-IFRS financial measures

 In this Offering Memorandum, the Group has included certain non-IFRS financial measures, such as total debt, net debt, EBIT, EBITDA, free cash flow, finance costs excluding indexation, nominal value of the G2 Notes, net debt to EBITDA ratio and EBITDA to finance costs ratio.

 None of these measures are an IFRS measure, nor should they be construed as an alternative to any IFRS measure such as revenue, gross profit, other income, net profit or cash flow from operating activities. The Group defines:

 • “total debt” as the sum of (a) current and non-current financial liabilities; and (b) current and non-current other financial liabilities;

 • “net debt” as total debt less (a) CLEF’s instruments held by the Group (which includes the nominal value of the G2 Notes); and (b) cash and cash equivalents;

 • “EBIT” as net profit/(loss) from continuing operations before financing and taxation;

 • “EBITDA” as trading profit before depreciation charges;

 • “free cash flow” as net cash flow from its current activities excluding extraordinary or exceptional cash movements in respect of the equity-related cash flows, financial transactions such as the raising of new debt

 xi


-----

###### to help finance new activities, debt refinancing, renegotiation or early repayment as well as investment in new activities or the divestment of activities and related assets;

 • “finance costs excluding indexation” as reported finance costs excluding indexation;

 • “nominal value of the G2 Notes” as the nominal value of the G2 Notes, indexed on UK inflation, plus the effective rate adjustment and interest accrued, but unpaid;

 • “net debt to EBITDA ratio” as a ratio of net debt as at the relevant date to EBITDA for the relevant period; and

 • “EBITDA to finance costs ratio” as a ratio of EBITDA for the relevant period to finance costs excluding indexation for the same period.

 These measures are sometimes used by investors to evaluate the efficiency of a company’s operations and its ability to employ its earnings toward repayment of debt and working capital requirements. There are no generally accepted principles governing the calculation of these measures and the criteria upon which these measures are based can vary from company to company. These measures, by themselves, do not provide a sufficient basis to compare the Group’s performance with that of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating profit or any other measure as an indicator of operating performance, or as an alternative to cash generated from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

 LTM Financial Information

 Certain financial information in this Offering Memorandum has been presented for the twelve months ended 30 June 2021. Such financial information has been computed by adding the number for H1 2021 to the number for FY 2020 and subtracting from the resulting total the number for H1 2020, in each case, in the relevant line item. These numbers are provided for convenience only and are not prepared in accordance with IFRS.

 As adjusted Financial Information of the Group

 The Group presents in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited consolidated financial information on an as adjusted basis to reflect the impact of the Transactions. See “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Information” and “Capitalisation”. For a description of the estimated application of the proceeds of the Transactions; see “Use Of Proceeds”. The unaudited as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the Group’s actual results would have been had the Transactions occurred on such dates nor do they purport to project the Group’s financial position or finance costs or other as adjusted financial data or ratios at any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments, nor the resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The as adjusted financial information assumes that the principal amount of the Additional Notes offered hereby is €150.0 million. To the extent the principal amount of the Additional Notes changes, the as adjusted financial information will correspondingly change.

 Roundings

 Certain data in this Offering Memorandum, including financial, statistical, and operating information has been rounded. As a result of the rounding, the totals of data presented in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such data. Percentages in tables have been rounded and accordingly may not add up to 100%.

 Currency Presentation

 Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Offering Memorandum to “sterling”, “pounds sterling”, “£”, or “pence” are to the lawful currency of the United Kingdom. All references to the “euro” or “€” are to the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of European economic and monetary union pursuant to the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended.

###### SUMMARY

 The following summary information should be read as an introduction to the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including Annexes A and B and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere, or incorporated by reference in, this Offering Memorandum. Any decision by a prospective investor to invest in the Additional Notes should be based on consideration of the Offering Memorandum as a whole, including the information discussed in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and the Annexes hereto and not solely on this summarised information.

 1.1 Overview of the Group

 The Group was created in 1986 with the signing of the Concession Agreement, which awarded the construction, financing and operation of the Tunnel to the Franco-British consortium of France Manche SA and The Channel Tunnel Group Limited. The operation of the Tunnel started in 1994 and in 25 years it has fundamentally changed the way trade takes place between the United Kingdom and continental Europe by enabling the development of new integrated cross-border logistics chains, as well as access to new markets.

 Since the Tunnel was brought into service, the Group has continually evolved, guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, in the search for growth and the creation of value. In 2018, it changed its name to “Getlink”. This name, which evokes the dynamism of exchanges, marks the Group’s entry into a new era of mobility infrastructures. Much more than merely a new page in its history, this name is a true commitment to the future with the development and management of safe, modern and environmentally-friendly mobility infrastructures.

 Today, the Group: (1) has a resilient business model; (2) is a competitive company focused on improving the profitability of its operations; (3) provides an environmentally-friendly transport service; (4) is resolutely focused on digitalisation; and (5) has a sustainable regional foothold. It operates a long-term (until 2086) Concession built around an integrated rail system beneath the sea enabling:

 (1) Eurotunnel segment’s transportation services

 The Group’s Eurotunnel segment offers a transport service between Calais in France and Folkestone in the United Kingdom. The service is provided aboard the Group’s Shuttles and through its Railway Network (which allows Rail Freight Services and High-Speed Passenger Trains to pass through the Tunnel). See Section 1.2 of Annex A.

 • The Group’s Truck Shuttles transport heavy goods vehicles, while its Passenger Shuttles transport passengers in vehicles (cars, coaches, motorbikes and motor homes). The Shuttle Services are in direct competition with ferry services and compete indirectly with airlines, as set out in Section 1.2.1.c of Annex A. In FY 2020, the Group’s Shuttle Services generated 64% of its revenue.

 • Third-party Railway Companies provide end-to-end high-speed passenger links, which travel through the Tunnel between continental Europe and the United Kingdom, without changing trains, and move their freight trains subject to a regulated tariff framework. As set out in Section 1.2.2.b of Annex A, the Group generated 20% of its revenue in FY 2020 from the use of the Railway Network by Railway Companies’ High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services.

 (2) Other types of services

 Since 2010, the Group has been diversifying its activities beyond its Eurotunnel segment:

 • its Europorte segment is involved in the entire rail freight transport logistics chain in France and more recently has been developing international services into Germany and the Benelux region (see Section 1.3 of Annex A); and

 • its ElecLink segment is tasked with delivering the future 1GW electricity interconnector between the United Kingdom and France (see Section 1.4 of Annex A).

###### 1.1.1 Business Model

 (a) Vital cross-Channel link

 Since its creation, the Group has facilitated the bringing together of people, companies and cultures. The Tunnel, the Group’s historic core business, is a vital link between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. In 2019, the reference year, it enabled more than 21 million passengers, 2.6 million cars and 1.6 million trucks to cross the Short Straits between France and the United Kingdom. The Tunnel enables safe and speedy transportation 365 days a year and 24 hours a day. More than a quarter of exports from the United Kingdom to the EU and more than a fifth of imports from the EU to the United Kingdom depend on the speed and reliability of the Tunnel (Source: EY 2018 Report), supporting approximately 220,000 jobs in the United Kingdom (Source: EY 2016 Report). 

 With strong expertise and sound fundamentals, while firmly focused on the future, the Group is the leader of the Short Straits transportation market (see “—Business Structure—Eurotunnel segment—Main Markets” below). It is constantly transforming and diversifying its operations in response to new mobility challenges, at a time when the evolution of trade and ecological transition are making transport and logistics strategic activities. The Group is now a major player in international trade and eco-responsible transport, bringing together a range of complementary brands. This unique position, founded on sustainable and innovative activities, is a source of resilience, offering great growth potential in the very long-term.

 (b) Strong core and diversified complementary activities

 The Tunnel is unique in the world and represents the foundation stone of the Group’s business model. However, alongside the Eurotunnel segment (which manages the Tunnel infrastructure, holds a long-term Concession and operates rail transport), the Group has successfully expanded its core business into several other areas ensuring diversified sources of future cash flows. These include Europorte, the leading private rail freight operator in France, a promising market given increasing environmental restrictions; ElecLink, the future electrical interconnector between the United Kingdom and France and a future growth driver for the Group; and CIFFCO, the first private rail training centre in France.

 (c) A safe, green, smart and premium transportation offer

 In an evolving world undergoing major changes with the digitalisation of the economy and shifting consumption patterns, technological progress and ecological transition, the Group offers all its customers a safe, green, smart, and premium transportation service. Safe, since the Tunnel is still the safest way to travel between the United Kingdom and continental Europe, both for passengers and freight. Green, because the Group manages some of the most environmentally-friendly mobility solutions and infrastructures. In 2019, Europorte and Eurotunnel’s businesses saved more than two million tonnes of CO2 compared to alternative modes of transport. Currently, a shuttle journey emits 12 times less greenhouse gases than a ferry journey for a truck and 73 times less greenhouse gases than a ferry journey for a car. Freight transport on the Europorte fleet emits five times less than transport by road. Fully invested in the digital revolution (see Section 1.1.3 of Annex A), the Group explores all the benefits of digital technology to offer its customers a service that is increasingly smart, whether in terms of innovation, quality, responsiveness or the precision of information provided. Finally, the Group stands out for its premium services and commercial offers, that are customised and adapted to consumer expectations, for a unique and constantly enriched customer experience.

 The Group has further demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by joining the French Business Climate Pledge, an initiative launched by the Movement of the Enterprises of France (Mouvement des enterprises de France) and joining the Ambition4Climate movement, an initiative of the Association of Large French Companies (Association française des enterpises privées). In June 2021, the Group set out its 2025 environmental action plan to meet environmental challenges (the “2025 Environmental Plan”). The Group’s 2025 Environmental Plan includes three pillars: (i) contributing to the 2°C trajectory of the United Nations’ Paris Agreement across the Group’s supply chain; (ii) sustainably managing the Group’s resources and impact on the environment and (iii) controlling waste and promoting the circular economy throughout the Group’s ecosystem. 

 (d) Creating value for all stakeholders

 As the Concession operator until 2086, the Group benefits from the length of the Concession as a stabilising long-term revenue factor, as well as a creator of sustainable value for all its stakeholders: customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, local economic players and inhabitants of the regions served. First and foremost, the Group stands out for its corporate culture founded on ethics, collective commitment and the importance placed on the customer. The well-being of the Group’s employees is a key element of its corporate strategy. The Group also enjoys a firm foothold in the areas of Calais (France) and Kent (England), two regions that it helps to promote, notably with the creation of an

###### estimated 8,000 direct and indirect jobs since the Tunnel entered service (Source: Université du Littoral Côte d’Opale). Through its rail transport business, the Group participates in regional development, while rail freight offers a means to reduce road congestion and decrease the environmental footprint of transport activities. Reliable and fast, the Fixed Link plays a decisive role in the development of e-commerce and the new economy. In addition, by securing electricity supply for households and the European power grid, ElecLink is expected to serve the general interest with minimal impact on the environment.

 1.1.2 Strategy

 Passenger and goods transport and mobility businesses face significant challenges. The digital transformation of these sectors generates changes in daily practices and processes, as well as future perspectives. The Group and the Concession are at the very heart of the changes facing passenger and goods transport this century, with several key challenges emerging: the digitalisation of the economy and of the customer relationship, notably in the specific context of Brexit and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Furthermore, while transport and logistics have progressively become strategic businesses with the globalisation of trade, changing consumption patterns, ecological transition and technological progress, employers in these sectors face difficulties attracting people to these businesses despite this favourable outlook.

 High-Speed Passenger Train services have development potential, which is slowed down by certain barriers to development, such as difficulties implementing efficient border controls, interoperability and obtaining rolling stock authorisations, which can delay, restrict or stop the development of services to new destinations. The Group is actively working with various stakeholders on these issues.

 The Group is determined to transform these challenges into opportunities through its: (i) strategic transformation plan; (ii) key financial and non-financial resources; (iii) approach to customer satisfaction; and (iv) CSR ambition.

 (a) Strategic transformation plan

 The change of the Group’s name to “Getlink” recognises its transformation into a major mobility player. In a context marked heavily by ecological transition and the digital revolution and alongside the changes in its shareholding structure, the Group has strengthened its position as a manager of safe, modern and low-carbon infrastructure. The Group is developing in businesses where growth is driven by constantly changing fundamental needs (such as procurement and travel). In this context, it is specifically focused on ensuring a dynamic pricing policy for its offerings and constant improvements to the railway system, taking account of the need to anticipate and accompany new market trends to incorporate them into a sustainable value creation strategy.

 The Group’s investment policy aims to support and amplify growth in its markets and focuses on investments that are complementary to existing assets. It aims to develop synergies within the Group and to leverage the specialist expertise of its teams in managing complex infrastructures and, particularly, the Tunnel. The Group’s investment policy has been revised to take account of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the development of the Group’s WAYforward programme in 2020. The WAYforward programme is an ambitious project for the years 2021-2025, involving 16 structural transformation projects (including lean management and digital projects) with the objective of changing the organisation of certain functions and the Group’s working methods to improve performance and relevance. The three pillars of the WAYforward programme are (i) customer knowledge and satisfaction, (ii) operational and commercial excellence and (iii) the quality of the Group's teams, as set out in Section 1.1.4 of Annex A.

 Alongside operating the Concession, which will remain its core business, the Group aims to continue the controlled diversification of its revenues by operating Europorte, a profitable rail freight business in France, and completing the ElecLink electricity interconnector project. ElecLink, which forms part of Getlink’s commitment to the development of a low-carbon economy, is expected to be a meaningful driver of growth in the Group’s revenues and margins once completed in 2022 (see “—Business Structure—ElecLink segment” below). The Group may also perform focused acquisitions, alone or in partnership, in transport infrastructure or activities that are capable of generating synergies with current businesses while strengthening the diversification of the Group’s business portfolio and contributing to a reduction in its risk profile.

 With Brexit came an increased need to provide a tailored response for each business, while integrating the proper understanding of situations and resources. The Group has prepared for the consequences of Brexit by developing innovative solutions in order to offer the best possible service to all its customers. The investment policy accompanying this plan aims to adapt its product offering and processes in line with market needs and specific customer expectations.

 The Group is committed to raising awareness and adapting the management of cross-border flows, working jointly with its stakeholders. The Group is mobilised to provide solutions supporting innovative cross-Channel transport and rail

###### freight transport services while placing customers at the heart of its business model. The Group pursues its long-term efforts with national authorities and rail participants to progressively resolve the barriers to the development of new services and has developed various actions to bring these opportunities to fruition, as set out in Section 1.2.2.b of Annex A.

 (b) Key resources

 The Group is able to offer the services of the Tunnel (a unique piece of rail infrastructure beneath the sea) thanks to the initial private investment of over €20 billion (at 2019 exchange rates). This infrastructure is constantly maintained and improved, such as with the modernisation of the Group’s fleet of Truck Shuttles and the Passenger Shuttle renovation programme (see Section 1.6.1 of Annex A). Over the life of the Concession, revenue from rail tolls (a regulated activity) and the Shuttle business is expected to be sufficient to cover the repayment of bank borrowings and remunerate equity contributed by investors via the payment of dividends. In addition, as a listed company, the Issuer allows investors to trade in its shares based on their own expectations of traffic levels and fluctuations in exchange rates and borrowing rates over the remaining Concession period.

 The Group’s successful operation of the Concession is only possible thanks to the 2,700 men and women in the United Kingdom and France who provide a high quality professional service, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. For 25 years, the Group has continuously trained employees with unique experience and expertise, without which the infrastructure would not be a success. Additionally, it is thanks to team members’ determination and exemplary engagement that the Group has been able to weather the COVID-19 pandemic with agility. In total, the Group brings together more than 3,500 team members across all its businesses. The Group is strengthening its action to diversify the profile of team members, including the implementation of its action plan on gender equality.

 In addition to its employees, who play an essential role in the Group’s foothold in the Kent and Calais areas, it contributes significantly to the development of the regional economy through local sub-contractors. The Group has been working to support the needs of the local communities in which it operates as closely as possible.

 Furthermore, among the Group’s resources that contribute to its smooth running, not counting the Concession Agreement that provides a secure legal framework and a long-term Concession period (see Section 8.2.2 of Annex A), the Group’s financing (see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and Section 8.2.4 of Annex A) and its rolling stock (see Sections 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 of Annex A), the Group’s internal culture is a key resource, whether with regard to ethics, collective commitment or the importance placed on the customer relationship.

 The Group manages its debt dynamically and with a view to optimising costs and improving agility. This agility was further enhanced in 2020. The Group’s debt was put in place during the 2007 financial restructuring. The successful refinancing of part of the debt in June 2017 enabled financial costs to be optimised and the recognition by the markets of the Group’s financial solidity. In 2018, the Group completed the third step in its financial reorganisation with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, enabling it to further refine its structure. In 2020, the Group refinanced the 2023 Notes with the issuance of the Original Notes. The Group’s debt supports its ability to, among other things, finance environmentally friendly projects, often of an energy transition nature, such as the development of renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements and the development of transport infrastructures with low greenhouse gas emissions.

 (c) Customer satisfaction

 The Group places the customer at the heart of its strategy and implements ways to enhance their satisfaction and loyalty. It achieves this, notably, by strengthening communication of real-time information and adapting services to the specific needs of customer segments, such as owners of electric vehicles, passengers travelling with pets and customers with reduced mobility.

 (d) CSR ambition

 In an environment marked by numerous geopolitical uncertainties, the Group has demonstrated the relevance of its business model. True to its entrepreneurial and responsible vision, the Group is expected to continue to promote long-term value creation and share this value with all its stakeholders. Firmly committed to sustainable growth, which is inseparable from its long-term goals, the Group is strengthening the integration of its non-financial challenges into its strategy and has launched a review of its CSR policy in conjunction with the material challenges identified in 2019 and the 10 Sustainable Development Goals (listed in Section 6.2 of Annex A) relevant to the Group’s activities. The Group is convinced that its ability to connect to its ecosystem is a source of innovation, value creation and responsible growth; it therefore favours an equitable approach to sharing value that combines economic, financial and non-financial performance, while investing to ensure the long-term success of the Group. It intends to consolidate its strengths across all CSR fields

###### and expand its actions in favour of the environment and the fight against climate change and to combine services to customers with strong action in favour of the environment.

 The Group announced its 2025 Environmental Plan in June 2021. The three pillars of the 2025 Environmental Plan each include a detailed action plan to achieve the Group’s ambitious objectives. These objectives include a 15% reduction in direct carbon dioxide emissions by 2023 and a 30% reduction by 2025; ISO 14001 certification or equivalent for the Group’s sites and activities; and maintaining the volume of waste produced at 2019 levels. The Group’s carbon dioxide emissions targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative and approved as as science-based targets on 20 July 2021, demonstrating the Group’s commitment to environmental preservation and sustainable mobility services.

 The Tunnel contributes to the organisation of regions, the mobility of individuals and bringing people together. Rail transport contributes to regional development and rail freight transport helps free-up roads. The Tunnel’s economic footprint is discussed in detail in Chapter 6 of Annex A, both in terms of employment and as a driver of corporate growth for business partners. “Le Shuttle” also promotes smooth, low-carbon travel by offering a service to cross the Channel with bicycles onboard.

 Alongside its main business as the Tunnel’s Concessionaire, the Group has sought to further enhance its infrastructure by developing an electricity interconnector project. The ElecLink interconnector, which is currently being tested, is the only fully private cross-Channel electricity interconnector. Once completed, this link is expected to play a key societal role by enhancing the European electricity network, optimising capacity production and securing electricity supply to consumers. After entering into service, ElecLink is expected to make a significant contribution to opening up the UK electricity market and is expected to benefit from the price difference between the electricity wholesale markets on each side of the Channel.

 Building on its experience in the rail sector, the Group controls, through its subsidiary Europorte, the leading private rail freight operator in France. With over 800 team members, it is well positioned to bring together European independent operators in a promising market and in a context of increasing environmental restrictions.

 With its subsidiary CIFFCO, the first training centre dedicated to rail industry professions, the Group possesses the technical expertise necessary to accompany growth in its Eurotunnel segment. 

 In 2020, the Group announced the formation of Régionéo, a joint venture with RATP Dev to offer regional passenger rail services in France.

 By combining its growth potential and the diversity of its businesses, the Group’s long-term strategy is to generate recurring cash flow enabling it to share value with its stakeholders, employees, shareholders and suppliers and ensure the Group’s development. Although the Group’s business model has demonstrated its relevance over the years, faced with unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 3 April 2020, the Board of Directors announced its decision to withdraw the Group’s proposed dividends in respect of the 2019 financial year (see “—The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s business and operating results—The Group’s response—Immediate measures”). The Group paid a dividend of €0.05 per share for the 2020 financial year, with €27.5 million in dividends paid in the six months ended 30 June 2021. The Group has also worked to protect jobs by participating in government furlough schemes and long-term partial activity programmes.

 Despite those challenges, the Group intends to continue to focus on an increasingly connected, innovative and collaborative model, serving sustainable growth and value creation for all stakeholders. In order to develop, the Group will seek to extend synergies between its businesses and strengthen the expertise of its teams in managing complex infrastructures. Capitalising on a solid core business, the Group will continue its controlled diversification strategy towards high-potential activities, spurred by growing needs that are essential to economic development: mobility of individuals, goods transport and energy transition. The Group also plans to further enhance its regional foothold on both sides of the Channel as a key player in the Anglo-European network.

 1.2 Business Structure

 The Group’s business is organised into the four following segments: (i) the Eurotunnel segment; (ii) the Europorte segment; (iii) the ElecLink segment; and (iv) the Getlink segment. For a diagram showing the Group’s summary corporate structure, see “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”. For a breakdown of the Group’s revenue by segment, see “Summary Financial and Other Information—Segmental Breakdown of Revenue”.

###### 1.2.1 Eurotunnel segment

 (a) Corporate Structure

 Eurotunnel Holding SAS is the parent company of the Eurotunnel segment. The following is a description of key entities comprising the Eurotunnel segment and their respective roles:

 • France Manche SA (“FM”) and The Channel Tunnel Group Limited (“CTG”) operate the Tunnel as Concessionaires in accordance with the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement (See Chapter 8 of Annex A). FM and CTG, whose shares are twinned, are both borrowers under the Term Loan (See Section 8.2.4 of Annex A).

 • Eurotunnel Services GIE and Eurotunnel Services Limited employ and manage the Group’s personnel mainly for the activities of the Concession. Relations between these companies and the Issuer’s other subsidiaries are described in Section 6.5 of Annex A.

 • Eurotunnel SE heads the distribution business in continental Europe (excluding France) of the Truck Shuttle Service activity. Eurotunnel Financial Services Limited is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to resell insurance products offered to passengers when they make their reservations. CTG acts as a representative of Eurotunnel Financial Services Limited for these requirements.

 • Gamond Insurance Company Limited, a wholly-controlled subsidiary of CTG, is registered in Guernsey since June 1996 and its sole purpose is to provide insurance against acts of terrorism in the United Kingdom (Insurance Business (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2002 as modified). On the authorisation of the IGC, this company was created in Guernsey because it is tax resident in the United Kingdom and its financial results are taxable in full in accordance with the Concession Agreement. The creation of a captive was the only way that the Group could access reinsurance protection guaranteed by the State via Pool-Re. As such, Gamond Insurance Company Limited is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission.

 (b) Main Markets

 The Eurotunnel segment offers both a Shuttle Service between Calais and Folkestone for the transport of passengers, cars, coaches and trucks and a Railway Network through which Railway Companies can run Rail Freight Services and High-Speed Passenger Trains. These services operate in the transport market between continental Europe and the United Kingdom.

 (1) Freight market

 Freight traffic between continental Europe and the United Kingdom is commonly divided into four distinct modes:

 • Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied: trucks and trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea on Shuttles or ferries at the same time as the road tractor and driver, mostly via the Short Straits;

 • Roll-On/Roll-Off unaccompanied: trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea independently of the road tractor, mostly via North Sea routes;

 • rail freight: conventional or Intermodal trains running through the Tunnel; and

 • Lift-On/Lift-Off: moveable containers or swap bodies loaded on Lift-On/Lift-Off container ships, mostly on the North Sea routes.

 The modal distribution varies by geographic zone and time constraints.

 The market is based on three corridors:

 • the Short Straits: all routes from continental Europe to Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate (including the Tunnel);

 • the English Channel: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the south coast of the United Kingdom, south west of Folkestone; and

 6


-----

###### • the North Sea: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the east coast of the United Kingdom, north of Ramsgate (including the Thames estuary).

 (2) Passenger market

 The Shuttles and the Short Straits ferries carry passengers travelling with their vehicles between the Pas-de-Calais in France (Coquelles for the Shuttles, Calais and Dunkirk for the ferries) and Kent in the United Kingdom (Folkestone for the Shuttles and Dover for the ferries). Transport services for passengers travelling without their vehicles are mainly provided by airlines or by High-Speed Passenger Trains and they represent a marginal and indirect source of competition to this service. Eurostar services operate in the transport market for passengers travelling, without their vehicles, principally between London and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. Eurostar’s main competitors are the airlines proposing air services between the United Kingdom and continental Europe.

 (3) Competitive position in the Short Straits

 The Shuttle Services are in direct competition with the ferry services and compete indirectly with airlines and, to a lesser extent, with Eurostar. In the freight market, the Truck Shuttle Service is in competition with ferry operators in the accompanied road transport route across the Short Straits. Over the last 20 years, there has been a marked shift towards the use of accompanied trucks between continental Europe and the United Kingdom. The market share between the different routes is currently relatively stable. The Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied mode on the Short Straits routes currently provides the shortest and quickest route for crossing the Channel. In the passenger market, since the early 2000s, the business model has changed to reflect trends in the international market (holidays, weekend breaks and closer trade links).

 Ferry operators

 Cross-Channel ferry operators are using larger ships offering greater capacity and enabling economies of scale to be realised over the long term, as they look for growth in the freight market rather than the passenger market.

 The Calais Port 2015 project, completed in September 2021, merged the ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer and extended the port of Calais and, in particular, its ferry terminal. This could strengthen the competitive position of ferries by enabling additional capacity. A relevant public service delegation contract was signed by the Hauts-de-France region of France (where both ports are located) on 19 February 2015. On 10 April 2015, the Group filed with the Administrative Court of Lille an application for the annulment of that contract. The court rejected that application in a judgement handed down on 8 November 2018. The Group appealed to the Douai Administrative Court of Appeal on 8 January 2019, which appeal is currently pending. In addition, construction is under way on a project to create a new terminal in the Western Docks at the port of Dover to accommodate larger ferries.

 The following ferry companies operate on the Short Straits:

 • P&O.  P&O Ferries (“P&O”) is a UK-based ferry operator. It is in direct competition with the Eurotunnel segment in both the freight market and the passenger market. Until the COVID-19 pandemic, P&O has operated up to six vessels on the Short Straits. In 2019, it ordered two new vessels which, at 230 metres long, were expected to be the largest deployed on routes to and from Dover. According to industry sources, both vessels are currently scheduled to be brought into service in 2023 (with an option for additional two vessels for delivery in 2024) and are intended to replace three ferries in P&O’s current fleet. In April 2020, P&O significantly reduced its fleet from six to three ships in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, a fourth ship was put back to service to accommodate the growing freight demand as the result of stockpiling in anticipation of the end of the Transition Period on 31 December 2020. Since then, P&O has ended the unaccompanied service on the Calais/Dover route and it offers an accompanied service only. On 30 June 2021, P&O put a fifth ship back into service.

 • DFDS Seaways. DFDS Seaways is owned by the Danish company DFDS. Following a temporary reduction between April and July 2020 in its Dover-Calais service in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DFDS returned to its normal fleet in 2021 with three ships on the Dover-Calais route and three ships on the Dover- Dunkirk route. In August 2021, DFDS replaced a vessel from its fleet operating on the Calais-Dover route, the Calais Seaways, with a new larger capacity ferry, the Côte d’Opale, for combined freight and passenger transport. Since summer 2021, DFDS has launched a new dedicated unaccompanied trailer service between Calais and Sheerness to replace the Calais-Dover and Dunkirk-Dover unaccompanied trailer services.

###### • Irish Ferries. Irish Ferries, owned by Irish Continental Group, launched its new Dover to Calais service at the end of June 2021. Irish Ferries currently operates one ship and a second vessel is planned for late 2021 and a third for early 2022.

 In addition, Blue Channel Line, a new venture of the Via Calais Group, has announced the launch of an unaccompanied trailer service on the Calais-Tilbury route in November 2021 using a low-carbon, smoke-free vessel.

 The Group considers that, under normal operating conditions, its Shuttle Service benefits from the following competitive advantages over ferries:

 • safety and security: the Group offers a reinforced security system at the site of Coquelles and additional means of control before boarding that reassure Truck Shuttle customers;

 • speed: the standard travel time between the French and British motorways is much shorter than that of the ferries;

 • departure frequency: the Shuttle Service runs more frequently than any of its competitors, and it runs every day of the year;

 • convenience: with the GSM-P system, Shuttle Services customers have uninterrupted access to GSM and 4G services in the Tunnel, as well as free Wi-Fi access across both terminals;

 • reliability: unlike the ferries, the Shuttle Service is not affected by sailing conditions and is not dependent on the weather; and

 • environmentally-friendly: the electric power it uses for traction generates much lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels used by the ferries.

 In preparation for Brexit, the Group deployed a set of measures to preserve and strengthen these advantages. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s Passenger Shuttles have benefited from the safety advantages for customers who travel in their own vehicle throughout the journey with minimal interaction with other people, as well as from the additional safety measures put in place by the Group which provide further reassurance to its customers and staff. On 23 February 2021, the Group’s Shuttle Services were certified by the French Association of Normalisation (Association Française de Normalisation, the French standards authority) with the maximum score of 100% following verification of the Group’s COVID-19 health-protection measures as set out in Section 6.5.3 of Annex A.

 Airlines, and particularly low-cost airlines, also have an indirect impact on the Short Straits market, which has been limited in 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In times of normal operation, these companies serve many destinations in continental Europe (including France) and thus compete with operators in the Short Straits, including the Passenger Shuttle Service in the short stay leisure market.

 Eurostar

 To a lesser extent, and even less in 2020, Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains compete indirectly with the Passenger Shuttle Service in the leisure market.

 (c) Activities

 (1) Fixed Link infrastructure

 Under the terms of the Concession Agreement, the States have entitled the Concessionaires to design, finance, construct and operate the Fixed Link between France and the United Kingdom without prejudice to the sovereign role of the States in terms of control and border enforcement. The Concession Agreement, which is described in Chapter 8 of Annex A, will expire in 2086.

 The Fixed Link is an integrated road and rail transport system that includes Shuttle Service (for cars and trucks) and a rail service (passenger and freight trains). The Concessionaires FM and CTG operate the transport system with Shuttles and make paths available to companies in possession of a licence, allowing them to operate cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services.

 8


-----

###### The Fixed Link comprises three tunnels of a length of about 50 kilometres each under the Channel, as well as the two terminals at Folkestone in the United Kingdom and Coquelles in France, the fixed equipment and the related installations:

 • Two rail tunnels with a single track are, during normal service, each used by the trains moving in a single direction.

 • The third tunnel, located for most of its length between the two main rail tunnels, is a secure means for evacuation and is also used for Tunnel maintenance.

 • Two cross over points between the rail tunnels allow trains to change between tunnels during maintenance work on certain sections of the tunnels.

 The Fixed Link is directly connected to the British and French motorway networks, via the Folkestone and Coquelles terminals which are the departure and arrival points. Retail and food service areas are available to customers at each terminal. The Fixed Link is also connected to the national French and British rail networks, and more particularly, to the high-speed lines.

 (2) Shuttle Services

 The Eurotunnel segment operates and directly markets its Shuttle Services. These comprise Truck Shuttles transporting heavy goods vehicles and Passenger Shuttles transporting passengers in their vehicles (cars, coaches, motorbikes and motor homes). Railway Companies’ High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services may also travel through the Tunnel in return for payment of a toll: the Group does not operate these services, but manages their passage through the Railway Network. In FY 2020, Shuttle Services generated €521 million of revenue (64% of the Group’s total revenue for the period, compared to €630 million of revenue in FY 2019 (58% of the Group’s total revenue for the period). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Shuttle Services revenue: (i) decreased to €189 million in H1 2021 (representing 58% of the Group’s total revenue for the period) from €212 million in H1 2020 (representing 57% of the Group’s total revenue for the period), or by 11%; and (ii) decreased to €148.7 million in Q3 2021 (representing 67% of the Group’s total revenue for the period) from €181.2 million in Q3 2020 (representing 72% of the Group’s total revenue for the period), or by 18%. See “—The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s business and operating results in H1 2021—Impact on H1 2021 traffic and revenue” and “—Recent Developments—Trading Update—Q3 2021 traffic and revenue update”.

 (i) Truck Shuttles Service

 The Truck Shuttle Service carries trucks between France and the United Kingdom on Truck Shuttles. At each terminal, drivers pass through separate Truck check-in, security and border control facilities. Drivers and passengers do not remain in their vehicles during the crossing, but travel in a carriage (called “Club-Cars”) specially designed for this purpose.

 Strategy

 The Group has the following strategy for its Truck Shuttle Service:

 • Truck service marketing strategy.  The strategy is based on optimising Truck Shuttle revenue and a pricing policy that reflects the fair value of the service provided by the Group, reflecting its speed, ease and reliability. The Group has put in place a mechanism to optimise Truck Shuttle revenue based on a pricing policy consisting of more flexible prices, adjustable according to demand and available capacity. The aim is to encourage an improved distribution of truck flows at all times of day and all week long, so that capacity and load factors can be optimised, whilst maintaining service quality during peak days. Throughout the year, the Group gives priority to customers under contract, only providing transport to occasional customers as available capacity allows.

 • Customer experience: “Simply Better Freight”.  The “Simply Better Freight” programme rethinks and simplifies all aspects of Truck Shuttle customers’ journey through the two terminals in Coquelles and Folkestone for a simpler and more reliable service in terms of journey time, while placing the safety of people and process control at the centre. In order to optimise processes and to cope with changes in administrative formalities linked to Brexit, “Pit-Stops” have been created at both terminals to group together safety and security checks at a single point before border controls. The Group continues to work on the fluidity of service

 Market share

 The Group estimates that its share of the Truck Shuttle Service market on the Short Straits corridor has evolved as follows during the periods indicated:

(1) The Short Straits market shares have been calculated using data reported by IRN Services Limited.

###### Until the end of February 2020, Truck Shuttle traffic was down 9% compared to 2019 due to the unfavourable base effect resulting from the stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit at the beginning of 2019. From mid-March onwards, certain market sectors, notably industry and more specifically the automotive sector, were strongly impacted by the consequences of the strict containment measures and other travel restrictions imposed by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other sectors have been more resilient, such as food, pharmaceuticals and e-commerce. As a result, Truck Shuttle traffic was down 28% in the second half of March, 34% in April and 29% in May 2020. Starting in June 2020, the first effects of the gradual lifting of certain containment measures were felt with a reduction in traffic limited to 11% for the month and then a reduction of 6% for July and August 2020, with a rebound of 2% in September 2020. However, the exceptional increase in volume observed in October 2019 explains the 7% decline in traffic in October 2020. From November 2020 onwards, traffic benefited from a significant impact from stockpiling ahead of the end of the Transition Period on 31 December 2020. In a Short Straits cross-Channel truck market that contracted by 6.9% in 2020, the Truck Shuttle Service’s share of the market was at 39.5%, compared to 40.4% in 2019. In 2020, the number of trucks transported by Eurotunnel decreased by 9% compared to 2019, to 1,451,556. In the Short Straits cross-Channel truck market that contracted during H1 2021 by approximately 2%, compared to H1 2020, the Eurotunnel segment’s Truck Shuttle Service’s market share remained relatively stable at 38.9% in H1 2021 compared to 39.2% in H1 2020. It was 38.4% in Q3 2021 compared to 39.3% in Q3 2020. The number of trucks transported by the Eurotunnel segment in H1 2021 decreased by 2.9% to 646,372, compared to H1 2020 and in Q3 2021 by 7% to 339,175, compared to Q3 2020.

 (ii) Passenger Shuttle Service (“Le Shuttle”)

 The Passenger Shuttle Service carries cars, motor homes, caravans, coaches, motorcycles and trailers between France and the United Kingdom onboard trains (Shuttles). Customers remain in their vehicle throughout the crossing, which normally lasts approximately 35 minutes from platform to platform. Each Passenger Shuttle has two sections: a double deck section mainly for cars and motorcycles and a single deck section reserved for vehicles higher than 1.85 metres, mainly coaches, minibuses and cars with roof boxes or towing caravans.

 The Passenger Shuttle Service can operate up to five departures per hour in each direction.

 Strategy

 The Group seeks to improve its Passenger Shuttle revenue by optimising the average revenue per Shuttle departure, with additional flexibility since 2016 in the form of the transport of small commercial vehicles. These can travel on the Passenger Shuttles, with a booked reservation. Scanners on the passenger terminals reinforce security measures for this service. The Group has the following strategy for its Passenger Shuttle Service:

 • Pricing policy: dynamic pricing. The pricing system adjusts ticket prices according to departure time and Shuttle load factor, thereby optimising passenger revenue and the average ticket price for passenger vehicles (e.g., cars, motor homes, caravans or motorcycles). Tickets can be bought in advance from the website (www.eurotunnel.com), using mobile apps, by telephone from the customer service centre, from travel agents and on arrival at check-in. Approximately 90% of “Le Shuttle” customer bookings are made online.

 • Adapting capacity to demand. The capacity of the Passenger Shuttle Service is regularly adjusted to improve the load factor and reduce costs. Operational adjustments are made to enable this, such as a better distribution of Shuttle departures during the day, with limited Passenger Shuttles at off peak times, increased services during peak times and the optimisation of train crew management.

###### • Customer service (“Customer Experience” and “Simply Better”). As a service business, “Le Shuttle” puts the customer at the heart of its strategy and uses every means to enhance their satisfaction and loyalty. Relevant measures include:

 • Actions and developments, with Brexit in mind, aimed at strengthening safety while speeding up passenger flows at borders, both on boarding and arrival, and contributing to increasing customer satisfaction. Developments include the installation of biometric facial recognition Parafe gates on the terminals in Coquelles and Folkestone for coach passengers to improve the smooth flow of checks and the installation of four PABLO kiosks in the Charles Dickens Passenger Building in Coquelles so that customers can claim back the tax paid on their purchases.

 • Improved real-time information, for each customer at every stage of their experience with the Group, with the roll-out of the digital transformation plan including new information boards in the passenger buildings.

 • Tailoring services to take account of the specific needs of each customer segment, such as drivers of electric vehicles or motorbikes, those travelling with their pets and customers with restricted movement. “Le Shuttle” also promotes low-carbon travel by offering a service to cross the Channel with a bicycle on board.

 • The Flexiplus service for customers who have priority boarding as well as two modern, dedicated lounges providing snacks, newspapers and Wi-Fi.

 • Providing automatic check-in facilities with automatic number plate recognition for all pre-reserved customers, which has reduced this stage of the customer journey to approximately a minute.

 • The Group is speeding up its digital transformation, with the main objectives of improving the customer experience, increasing the fluidity of customer service and optimising Tunnel and Shuttle maintenance. These measures were founded on two pillars: the creation of a digital culture within the business and the installation of a high-performing and secure IT technical platform.

 To prepare for the challenges related to Brexit, the Group implemented a range of measures described in Section 1.6.1 of Annex A.

 Market share

 The Group estimates that its share of the car and coach passenger markets on the Short Straits has evolved as follows during the periods indicated:

the Passenger Shuttle Service’s share of total CEU transported on the Short Straits as reported by IRN Services Limited.

(2) The market shares have been calculated using data reported by IRN Services Limited.

###### In 2020, the Short Straits car market contracted by approximately 56.2%, as it was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit uncertainties. In a difficult market, the Eurotunnel segment’s share of the car market continued to grow, reaching 70.1% in 2020. In 2020, the cross-Channel coach market contracted by approximately 78.9% compared to 2019. However, the Passenger Shuttle’s share of the coach market increased to 54.9%.

 Measures put in place by governments to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-March 2020 onward included closing international borders for non-essential travel. As a result, the level of passenger vehicle traffic (including cars and coaches) on the Passenger Shuttle Service decreased dramatically by 75% in the second half of March, 91% in April, 81% in May and 69% in June of 2020, in each case, compared to the relevant months of 2019, and remained depressed throughout 2020 and 2021 compared to pre- COVID-19 levels.

 11


-----

###### Overall, in H1 2021, the Short Straits cross-Channel car market contracted by approximately 61.7%, compared to H1 2020. However the Eurotunnel segment’s share thereof increased to 78.8% in H1 2021, compared to 65.9% in H1 2020. The number of cars transported by the Eurotunnel segment in Q3 2021 decreased by approximately 39%, compared to Q3 2020. The Eurotunnel segment’s share thereof remained relatively stable at 71.2% in Q3 2021, compared to 72.4% in Q3 2020. Also in H1 2021, the Short Straits cross-Channel coach market contracted by approximately 75.6% compared to H1 2020. However the Eurotunnel segment’s share thereof increased to 75.6%, compared to 50.7% in H1 2020. The number of coaches transported by the Eurotunnel segment in Q3 2021 decreased by approximately 44% compared to Q3 2020.

 (3) Railway Network

 In FY 2020, the Group earned 20% of its revenue from the use of the Railway Network by Railway Companies’ High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services (H1 2021: 20%, Q3 2021: 18%). The Group does not operate these trains, but manages their passage through the Tunnel.

 The use of the Tunnel by the Railway Companies is governed by the Railway Usage Contract with the national Railways, which is in force until 2052 (see Chapter 8 of Annex A). Under this charging framework, the Railways are obliged to pay to the Group variable charges according to the number of passengers on High-Speed Passenger Trains, as well as fixed annual charges. The variable charges are determined on the basis of a toll formula, which takes into account the effects of inflation to a certain extent. In addition, the Railways are required to contribute to the operating costs of the System, as well as to investment costs relating to the renewal of equipment.

 The Railway Usage Contract’s long-term charging framework is applied and published every year by the Concessionaires in the document called “Network Statement”, which sets out access conditions to its Railway Network for all Railway Companies, for the operation of High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services, as well as the charging scale for the relevant year. The Network Statement now sets out a simplified charging mechanism for freight trains, with a charge per train instead of per tonne of freight, as was originally the case.

 The Group’s revenue from its Railway Network is thus generated from variable charges received based on the number of passengers transported by Eurostar High-Speed Passenger Trains and the number of Rail Freight Services trains, annual fixed charges and the contribution to the operating costs of the System. In FY 2020, the Group generated €163 million of revenue from the use of its Railway Network. Severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Railway Network revenue decreased to €66 million in H1 2021 from €96 million in H1 2020, or by 31%, and increased to €39.2 million in Q3 2021 from €36.1 million in Q3 2020, or by 9%.

 (i) High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar and future new market entrants)

 The market for High-Speed Passenger Train services (Eurostar and future new entrants) comprises business and leisure passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. The market is geographically diverse and includes, on the one hand, inter-capital travel between London and Paris, or London and Brussels and Amsterdam and, on the other hand, a wider flow of passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. Until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eurostar also operated a direct service to Disneyland Paris and to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille during the spring and summer and a service to Bourg-Saint-Maurice in winter. As part of a cost-cutting plan in response to the COVID-19 crisis, Eurostar announced in 2020 the suspension of services to and closure of the Ashford, Ebbsfleet and Calais-Fréthun terminals for the duration of the public health crisis as well as the suspension of its seasonal services to the French Alps and the South of France for the winter and 2021 summer seasons.

 Market share

 The table below sets out Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains’ share of the market on the Paris-London and Brussels/Amsterdam-London routes for the periods indicated:

###### Eurostar recorded an average growth in traffic of approximately 2% over five years (from 2009 to 2014) followed by a contraction of approximately 4% after the shock of the terrorist attacks in 2015/2016. A recovery in 2017/2018 saw volumes grow beyond those of 2014 and 2015 on existing routes (London to Paris and Brussels). Growth was further boosted by the service to Amsterdam and Rotterdam launched in April 2018 with two daily services and increased to three daily services in June 2019. This mitigated the considerable impact of the strikes by French customs officers in the spring of 2019 and the SNCF strikes against pension reforms in December of that year, resulting in a 1% increase in traffic in 2019. Calculated in accordance with the pricing framework indexing formula set out in the Railway Usage Contract, the unit toll per passenger paid by Eurostar decreased by 0.3% in 2020 in a context of negative inflation rates.

 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Eurostar traffic was seen as early as the beginning of March 2020. Following the closure of borders to non-essential travel in the mid-March 2020, the number of services was quickly reduced to two return trips per day (London-Paris and London-Brussels) carrying only a few hundred passengers per day. Additionally, the implementation by the United Kingdom from 8 June 2020 of a 14-day quarantine period for almost all individuals entering its territory, followed by various permutations of border closures, heightened COVID-19 testing requirements and quarantine requirements, seriously delayed the resumption of Eurostar traffic, which continues to be significantly impacted. Due to these developments, in H1 2021, 202,022 Eurostar passengers used the Tunnel, a decrease of 90%, compared to H1 2020. 

 The introduction by the British government of the three-tiered traffic light system for international arrivals on 17 May 2021, along with the relaxation of quarantine requirements for vaccinated passengers returning from amber list countries on 19 July 2021 (including France from 8 August 2021), and the further simplification of the country list and testing requirements announced on 17 September 2021, has positively impacted Eurostar passenger traffic, although it remains severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q3 2021, 442,891 Eurostar passengers used the Tunnel, an increase of 30%, compared to Q3 2020.

 Competitive environment

 Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains connect London with the centre of Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam and compete directly with airlines (both traditional and low-cost) operating these routes in the business and leisure segments, in terms of travel time, frequency, comfort and price. In addition, for short-stay leisure trips, Eurostar also competes with low-cost airlines whether in terms of price, capacity and choice of destination, not only for destinations served by Eurostar but also for other short-haul destinations. Within the framework of the liberalisation of the international rail passenger transport market, on 1 January 2010, the Group published its efficient and non-discriminatory conditions for access in its Network Statement thereby offering all Railway Companies, including new entrants, the opportunity to operate cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Train services to existing or new destinations in competition with each other and with the airline sector.

 Eurostar

 Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Train services are operated by Eurostar International Limited, owned 55% by SNCF, 5% by SNCB, and 40% by a consortium comprising CDPQ, the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and Hermes Infrastructure. In September 2019, Eurostar and Thalys announced a proposed alliance, “Green Speed”, to combine their high-speed service networks, develop an offering of new sustainable mobility services, and increase rail passenger volumes. In October 2021, the CEO of the National Railway Company of Belgium (SNCB) announced that Eurostar and Thalys would proceed with their plans for a merger in 2022 and that the Eurostar brand would be expected to cover both legacy Eurostar and legacy Thalys operations by 2023. The proposed merger will be subject to the approval of the respective boards of directors, shareholders and lenders of Eurostar and Thalys and will also involve consultation with their representative bodies of employees and review by the European Commission.

 Eurostar’s rolling stock fleet primarily comprises recent Siemens e320 trains (introduced in 2015) offering a high level of comfort (on-board Wi-Fi, individual sockets), power (top speed of 320km/h), capacity (nearly 900 passengers, 20% more than the original fleet) and interoperability (electrical power supply and cab signalling systems compatible with the Dutch network). The Eurostar fleet also includes modernised Alstom e300 trains offering a similar level of comfort to the e320.

 Since 2007, the High-Speed Passenger Trains services have benefited from the high-speed line between London St. Pancras International and the Tunnel, which reduced the transit time between Paris and London or Brussels and London by around 20 minutes. With the destinations serviced by London St. Pancras International station, Eurostar benefits from improved rail links with northern England (proximity of rail services from St. Pancras, King’s Cross and Euston stations). Ebbsfleet International station, located near the M25 London orbital motorway, also allows Eurostar to expand its catchment area.

 13


-----

###### In 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, Eurostar ran 13 to 19 departures in each direction between Paris and London and 8 to 10 trains in each direction between London and Brussels (including two-to-three daily services from London to Amsterdam) on week days, with adjustments depending on the day, the season and the destination. Some services made intermediate stops at Ebbsfleet or Ashford International in the United Kingdom and at Calais-Frethun or Lille-Europe in France. Eurostar also runs a periodic service to Disneyland Paris and seasonal services from London and Ashford to Bourg-Saint-Maurice with two return journeys a week (from December to April, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as a spring/summer seasonal service in 2019 (May to September) from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille with three or four return journeys a week.

 Eurostar has regularly adjusted its capacity and services in response to the very significant drop in traffic as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the various lockdown and quarantine restrictions imposed by the British and French governments. Since mid-2020, Eurostar have operated a limited number of return trips per day and announced the closure of their services to and the closure of the Ashford, Ebbsfleet and Calais-Frethun terminals until at least 2023 and the cancellation of their seasonal services to the French Alps and to the South of France for the 2021 winter and summer seasons. However, Eurostar have been gradually increasing capacity offered during 2021 in response to the progressive reopening of borders and easing of quarantine requirements for vaccinated arrivals in Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

 Development of new destinations

 To help accelerate the development of new cross-Channel passenger rail links and to accelerate the realisation of these new service opportunities, the Group has developed ETICA-Pax, a financial assistance mechanism for the launch of new cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Train services. Through the ETICA-Pax programme, the Group contributes to creating direct services to new destinations by reducing the launch cost of these new services and proportionately  rewarding Railway Companies for their market development efforts.

 Eurostar’s direct London-Amsterdam service was originally launched in April 2018 in the form of a direct single journey in the direction London to Amsterdam and Rotterdam, with the Amsterdam-London return journey requiring a stop at Brussels for passport and security checks. The service nevertheless began with two daily services on weekdays. A third daily service was added by Eurostar in June 2019 in response to strong demand.

 In order to allow direct travel in the direction Amsterdam and Rotterdam to London, the British and Dutch governments concluded on 7 July 2020 the international treaties necessary to set up juxtaposed border controls in the Netherlands, and on 26 October 2020 Eurostar launched its new direct return service to and from both Amsterdam and London. This service enables travellers to save an hour’s travel time and enjoy the comfort of a direct service in both directions. This is a historic milestone in the expansion of high-speed international rail travel on this major route, which represented nearly 5 million passengers in 2019. Passengers can now travel from the heart of London directly to the Netherlands and back at a speed of 300 km/h, in nearly three hours to Rotterdam and four hours to the centre of Amsterdam. The introduction of this essential factor for attractiveness and competitiveness makes it possible to offer a relevant and competitive high-speed rail service alongside air services on this major European and global air route. When the travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 public health crisis ease further, Eurostar will be able to reintroduce and then increase the frequency of direct services between London and Amsterdam, with the ability to return to the four daily services that Eurostar previously announced and the potential to add more over time. With the ETICA-Pax incentive scheme, the Group has contributed to the launch and accelerated development of these services.

 Since 2015, Eurostar has operated a direct seasonal service from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille in the spring and summer months (although, as noted above, this service has been cancelled for 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). However, this service required passengers to disembark at Lille on the return trip for border controls and therefore there remains significant potential for improving competitiveness.

 Further opportunities for direct services exist notably to Germany (Cologne, Frankfurt), Switzerland (Geneva) and southern France (Marseille as a direct return, Bordeaux and the French Riviera). Moreover, climate-related government initiatives and public awareness of the climate emergency and respect for the environment demonstrate a growing interest in the development and use of rail mobility services over longer distances, which could facilitate the emergence of high- speed cross-Channel rail services to new destinations that were hitherto the province of air services.

 In 2010, Deutsche Bahn stated its intention to launch ICE High-Speed Passenger Train services from London to Cologne and Frankfurt. The operating model for these services was finally authorised by the IGC in June 2013, but a development plan is yet to be confirmed due to major project delays.

###### A study carried out by an international consulting firm in 2018 proved the development potential of alternative low-cost rail services between secondary stations in Paris and London such as, for example, Charles de Gaulle and Stratford International. This study confirmed both the complementary nature of such a link with the line currently operated and its potential profitability.

 These service development projects require the resolution of a number of technical, equipment and regulatory constraints (including, for example, rolling stock authorisations, efficient security and border controls, improved access to and modification of stations, investment in interoperability, development of train paths and long-term visibility), as well as cooperation between the relevant national authorities in respect of the implementation of efficient border controls. The Group continues its long-term efforts with national authorities and rail organisations to eliminate these barriers to the development of new destinations and in particular the development of direct rail services between London, Cologne and Frankfurt.

 Significant progress has been achieved with the implementation of “open access” for international passenger services across Europe and the increasing application of interoperability standards, notably with efforts to standardise IGC technical requirements for cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Trains.

 Further progress remains necessary, in particular with regards to border controls, to develop solutions that are efficient and tailored to the type of destination (preparation of boarding areas in stations for juxtaposed controls for frequent services between capital cities and other models comprising on-board control or controls on arrival for regular regional services) and thereby preserve the benefits of speed and convenience that are essential to the competitiveness of High-Speed Passenger Train services.

 Further standardisation of authorisation rules and processes for rolling stock and the ability to use new equipment are also essential to facilitating the development of the market. In this regard, the Group continued to invest to adapt its electric traction installations to accommodate new rolling stock in optimal conditions, as was done for Eurostar’s Siemens e320 trains.

 The Group is working in close cooperation with rail infrastructure managers on initiatives aimed at reducing these barriers to developing, facilitating and promoting the introduction of new direct destinations (notably, interoperability investments and boarding areas in stations). In this context, the Group continued and extended its cooperation with other infrastructures in 2019 and 2020, through concrete initiatives such as the development of interoperable signalling systems on the London-Paris-Brussels routes (ERTMS), the design of an international terminal for border controls at Bordeaux Saint Jean (development of the Bordeaux-London market) and proposed applications of this cooperation model for the development of boarding areas in stations and border controls for other new destinations, including Germany.

 (ii) Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services

 Market developments

 Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services compete with most means of road, sea and rail transport between continental Europe and the United Kingdom. They offer their own advantages of efficiency and attractiveness with a Channel crossing without the need to change to a different mode of transport and a means of transport that is particularly environmentally-friendly and potentially a quality of service not affected by traffic congestion or weather conditions.

 With the aim of promoting the development of Rail Freight Services traffic in the Tunnel, the Group has put in place ETICA-Freight, a programme to help the launch of new services. These initiatives demonstrated their pertinence with a sustained period of traffic growth between 2010 and mid-2015, which was translated into cumulative growth of more than 40% in the number of trains, including the creation of new Intermodal services and an increase in the flow of aluminium and automobile components. This growth dynamic was halted abruptly in the summer of 2015 during the peak of the migrant crisis in the Calais area, which resulted in the loss of half of the cross-Channel Rail Freight Services, as it shifted either to unaccompanied services or to container transport via the North Sea, or more generally to transportation by road.

 In 2016, the set-up of effective security for cross-Channel rail freight operations allowed traffic to stabilise at the level reached at the end of 2015, followed by a return to growth due to the ramp-up of services assisted by ETICA-Freight during 2017, 2018 and 2019 (and the launch of new Intermodal Rail Freight Services to Germany and Italy, suspended following the SNCF strike in the second half of 2018). In 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the suspension of steel and then automobile flows, rail freight traffic decreased both in train numbers (down 19%) and tonnage transported (down 18%) compared to 2019.

###### In H1 2021 and Q3 2021, cross-Channel rail freight continued to be affected by the loss of steel flows as well as a weakness in automobile flows. Nevertheless, the number of freight trains crossing the Channel increased by 2% in H1 2021, compared to H1 2020. In Q3 2021, the number of freight trains crossing the Channel remained relatively stable, decreasing by approximately 1% compared to Q3 2020.

 Competitive environment

 Rail freight through the Tunnel, originally developed by the state-run Railways, has had a history of disappointing results and organisational difficulties. International rail freight is also held back by inadequate national infrastructure (in particular train gauge, length and weight restrictions in the United Kingdom, quality and availability of paths in France), distortions in favour of sea and road transport and excessive constraints (regulatory, workforce and technical).

 Rail freight trains are in competition with most modes of freight transport in operation between continental Europe and the United Kingdom and, in particular, with unaccompanied maritime services via the North Sea, with onward road or rail transport in continental Europe.

 Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services

 Rail Freight Services between continental Europe and the United Kingdom are run by Railway Companies, including DB Cargo (on behalf of BRB), SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, RailAdventure, Europorte, Rail Operations Group and potentially any goods train operator in open access. Three different types of Rail Freight Services use the Railway Network:

 • intermodal trains, composed of platform wagons transporting containers or swap bodies;

 • conventional trains (carrying palletised goods in enclosed wagons or bulk loads in adapted wagons, such as tankers, hoppers and platforms) carried as a trainload; and

 • trains with specialised wagons for transporting new cars.

 In order to revive cross-Channel rail freight, the Group has adopted a strategy based on three pillars: (i) development of open access for rail freight operators, (ii) efficient processing of border constraints, and (iii) a simplified and competitive pricing policy.

 Development of services and competitiveness

 Following the loss of half of cross-Channel Rail Freight Services in 2015, the Group informed the European Commission that the common rail freight growth objectives could not be attained. The Group continues to work with the governments and the Railway Companies on implementing solutions to stimulate the revival of this traffic.

 In 2018, the Group completed the construction of a full-train scanner on the national railway network in Frethun. In 2019, the Group received authorisation to commission this scanner, which now enables customs officials to control Rail Freight Services trains moving at a speed of 20km/h, enhancing the security and fluidity of cross-Channel rail freight and, consequently, its attractiveness. The Group also participated in working groups with the authorities and rail freight players to organise the fluidity of cross-Channel Rail Freight Services in various Brexit scenarios, leading to digitalisation of customs formalities and their relocation to origin and destination rail terminals. This offers a robust process, independent of port and road border infrastructure, which is attractive to transporters interested in unaccompanied solutions and to loaders seeking to diversify their logistics chains. In addition, the Group extended its ETICA-Freight financial aid programme to support the launch of new destinations, creating a growing interest in the development of new services.

 In order for these growth efforts to produce their full effect, the Group continues to draw the attention of the authorities to the need to progressively address the barriers to development existing on the national networks (train gauge,

 16

###### length and tonnage limits, network quality and availability, border constraints, etc.). These barriers continue to hold back the development of cross-Channel rail freight, and represent a considerable potential for efficiencies waiting to be unlocked.

 (4) Other revenue

 In FY 2020, the Eurotunnel segment’s other revenue was €8 million, representing 1% of total revenue (H1 2021: €5 million representing 2% of total revenue, Q3 2021: €3 million representing 1% of total revenue). This revenue consists mainly of (i) revenue from third-party retail businesses in the terminals on both sides of the Tunnel, (ii) revenue from telecommunication lines in the Tunnel, (iii) revenue related to the Group’s property business and (iv) the sale of travel insurance products in the United Kingdom.

 For additional details on the Fixed Link capacities and reliability, please see Section 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 of Annex A.

 1.2.2 Europorte segment

 (a) Corporate Structure

 The holding company of the Europorte segment, Europorte SAS, controls all rail freight transport subsidiaries of the Group, providing a wide range of integrated rail freight services, including national and international haulage, local services for secondary line, and services to industry (individual junction management, infrastructure maintenance and wagon loading and unloading).

 The activities of the Europorte segment are carried out by various subsidiaries of Europorte SAS, including Europorte France (EPF), Europorte Proximite (EPP), Socorail and Europorte Channel (EPC).

 (b) Main Markets

 According to data published by the French Ministry for Ecological Transition (Ministère de la Transition Écologique), the French rail freight industry in 2020 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as by strikes in January, with an overall volume of 30.4 billion tonne-kilometres in 2020, a decrease of approximately 5.1% compared to 2019, following decreases of approximately 0.8% in 2019 compared to 2018 and approximately 4.6% in 2018 compared to 2017. Europorte transported 1.7 billion tonne-kilometres in 2020, down approximately 4% compared to 2019, representing an estimated market share of approximately 6%. 

 (c) Activities

 Due to its dense coverage in France and its recent development of international services to Germany and the Benelux region, Europorte is positioned as a growth vehicle for the Group. It is present across the entire rail freight transport logistics chain, from collecting and routing on primary and secondary networks (Europorte France) to loading and unloading of wagons on private branch lines on industrial sites (Socorail) and managing rail infrastructure (ports, private and public/private industrial sites) in France and also in Belgium. Europorte is developing its various complementary activities concurrently in order to offer its customers complete and customised solutions that meet their expectations for integrated logistics chains and high quality of service.

 Revenue generated by the Group’s Europorte segment decreased to €123 million in FY 2020, compared to €126 million in FY 2019, or by 2%, impacted in January 2020 by the SNCF Réseau strike and then from mid-March by the COVID-19 pandemic. In H1 2021, the Europorte segment’s revenue increased to €66 million from €58 million in H1 2020, or by 14%, returning to normal order volumes in H1 2021 after a first half of 2020 impacted by the public health crisis, with volumes in H1 2021 boosted by an acceleration in the development of cross-border flows with Belgium and Germany with the launch of the Flex Express service. In Q3 2021, the Europorte segment’s revenue remained stable, increasing to €32.3 million from €32.2 million in Q3 2020.

 1.2.3 ElecLink segment

 (a) Corporate Structure

 ElecLink Limited’s corporate purpose is the construction and operation of a 1GW electricity interconnector between the UK and France. Preliminary work began towards the end of 2016 and the interconnector is scheduled to be brought into service in mid-2022. GET Elec Limited, a subsidiary of the Issuer, holds the entire share capital of ElecLink Limited.

 17


-----

###### (b) The project

 The Group seeks to further enhance its infrastructure by developing an electricity interconnector project in the Tunnel. ElecLink involves the installation of a new electricity interconnector between the French and British grids. This will enable the import and export of electricity from one country to the other with a bi-directional transmission capacity of 1GW via high-voltage direct current cabling installed in the north rail tunnel. Once commissioned, ElecLink Limited will own the only fully private cross-Channel electricity interconnector benefitting from a 25-year exemption from certain European regulations, namely Article 17 of European Directive 714/2009, which has now been replaced by Article 63 of Regulation 2019/943 (the “European Union Electricity Regulation”). This will enable the Group to retain the economic value generated by the asset subject to the profit-sharing mechanisms agreed under the exemption. ElecLink will also play a key societal role by enhancing the integration of European power markets via optimisation of the dispatch of installed generation capacity, including renewable energy sources, across both countries and securing affordable electricity supplies to consumers. The entry into service of ElecLink in 2022 is expected to represent a marked improvement in the profitability of the Group.

 Construction formally commenced at the end of 2016 by leading contractors: Siemens for the two converter stations in France and the United Kingdom and Balfour Beatty/Prysmian for the supply and installation of the direct current cables in the Tunnel and the underground alternating current cable required to connect the ElecLink converter station to the British high voltage grid at the National Grid ESO substation at Sellindge in the United Kingdom. In France, RTE has provided the underground alternating current cables connecting the ElecLink converter station to the substation at Les Mandarins.

 As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the following construction activities have been successfully completed:

 • construction of the two converter stations, including all civil and electromechanical works outside the Tunnel;
 • construction of a 14.5km system of underground alternating current cables in the United Kingdom between the ElecLink converter station in Folkestone and the national grid substation in Sellindge;
 • manufacturing of the direct current cables;
 • enabling works inside the Tunnel consisting of a steel support structure for the cables (brackets fixed to the Tunnel lining, which support a monorail system); 
 • enabling works outside the Tunnel, including assembly facilities (the cables are assembled on a specially designed helix in readiness to be pulled into the Tunnel on an external monorail system);
 • completion of the Tunnel cable connection work ahead of schedule; and 
 • launch of the test phases for final interconnector authorisation by the IGC.

 As discussed in detail in Chapter 3 of Annex A, the construction, as with any new project, carries risks related to technical implementation and compliance with performance levels, as well as the commissioning schedule, all within a regulatory context that may change. The safety of the project, both in terms of construction safety and the operational safety of the cable in the Tunnel, is paramount to the Group and is the subject of detailed ongoing monitoring by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority of the IGC. 

 In 2020, the Group continued its exchanges with the IGC, the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, the ad-hoc committee and the working group of their experts to enable the IGC to take a global decision on the authorisation for the installation of the cable in the Tunnel and the commissioning of the interconnector. Following initial consent granted on 7 October 2020 to carry out and test the connection of the converter stations to the national electricity networks in France and Britain, the IGC gave its approval on 10 December 2020 for the installation of the cable in the Tunnel. The cable installation work commenced in January 2021 and was completed on 20 June 2021. A phase of extensive testing and trials is being carried out in the second half of 2021, with the first electrical tests successfully carried out through the cable from 31 August to 2 October 2021. Commercial operation is currently planned to begin in mid-2022. 

 The exemption under the European Union Electricity Regulation required that the ElecLink interconnector become operational no later than 31 July 2020. However, as part of the IGC agreement reached on 10 December 2020, the national regulators and the European Commission granted an extension until 30 June 2021 allowing the stakeholders to finalise an agreement on the final commissioning date. In the first half of 2021, ElecLink submitted a request for a final extension, bringing the deadline for commissioning the interconnector to 15 August 2022. The national regulators and the European Commission have confirmed their agreement to this request. 

 In FY 2020 and H1 2021, the Group invested further €74 million and €53 million, respectively, in the ElecLink project, bringing the total tangible asset on the consolidated statement of financial position at 30 June 2021 to €732 million,

 18


-----

###### including the external construction costs, ancillary and intra-group project and financing costs. Once operational, ElecLink is expected to generate revenue for the Group from the following sources:

 • Revenue from the auctioning of physical transmission rights.  This is expected to be the primary source of revenue for ElecLink and will provide electricity market participants (traders, generators and suppliers) the opportunity to purchase up to 1,000MW of transmission capacity in either direction of flow over a number of timeframes. ElecLink is expected to offer both long term (e.g., annual, seasonal, quarterly and monthly) and short term (i.e., day ahead and intraday) products. All products will be made available to the market through open, transparent and non-discriminatory auction mechanisms in compliance with the ElecLink Access Rules, which were approved by the national energy regulators, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) in the United Kingdom and the Commission de regulation de l’energie (CRE) in France, during the course of 2019. The ElecLink Access Rules set out the terms on which third parties can purchase and use transmission capacity on the interconnector. In addition, the Charging Methodology Statement for the ElecLink interconnector, which was also approved by Ofgem in 2019, sets out the methods and principles on which charges for the use of the interconnector.

 • Revenue from the capacity markets in France and the United Kingdom.  Through these national mechanisms (administered by Reseau de transport d’électricité (RTE) in France and by National Grid ESO in the United Kingdom) electricity interconnectors are remunerated, alongside generators and other capacity providers, for their contribution to security of supply either through the sale of capacity certificates to energy suppliers in France or through annual capacity agreements awarded through auctions in the United Kingdom. In 2019, ElecLink entered into an agreement with RTE confirming its participation in the French capacity market from 2021, while in the United Kingdom ElecLink has participated successfully in the T-4 auctions for delivery years 2021/22, 2024/25 and in the 2020 T-3 and T-4 auctions for delivery years 2022/23 and 2023/24 respectively. These auctions have secured agreements equating to £35.15 million although the actual amount received will depend on when ElecLink goes live.

 • Revenue from the provision of ancillary services to the national Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in France and the United Kingdom. These services facilitate short term changes to the flow of energy over the interconnector and are used by the national TSOs to ensure the security and quality of supply of electricity in their grids. They may include frequency response services, provision of reactive power, emergency assistance, constraint management and intertripping among other services, which may be agreed from time to time between ElecLink and the national TSO.

 1.2.4 Getlink segment

 (a) Corporate Structure

 The Getlink segment encompasses the Group’s corporate services, the activities of the Group parent company, the Issuer, as well as those of its direct subsidiaries, including the railway training centre CIFFCO. The following is a description of key entities comprising the Getlink segment and their respective roles:

 • The Issuer is the Group’s listed parent company. In 2007, a new holding company, Groupe Eurotunnel SA, was set up along with a proposal to all shareholders of the former Eurotunnel structure to exchange their twinned shares for its ordinary shares. This offer was accepted by more than 93% of shareholders. In late 2007, Eurotunnel PLC and Eurotunnel SA became TNU PLC and TNU SA, respectively, and were then absorbed by Groupe Eurotunnel SA in May 2009 and October 2010, respectively. Groupe Eurotunnel SA became Groupe Eurotunnel SE in December 2014 and was subsequently renamed Getlink SE in April 2018.

 • The Centre International de Formation Ferroviaire de la Côte d’Opale (CIFFCO) supplies professional training services in the rail sector (see Section 1.5 of Annex A).

 • Euro-Immo GET SAS manages and develops the Group’s property assets and performs associated activities (see Section 1.5 of Annex A).

 • London Carex Limited is involved in a potential project for the development of rail freight in the United Kingdom (see Section 1.5 of Annex A).

 • Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited is the entity that holds the G2 Notes (see Note G.7 to the 2020 Annual Financial Statements).

 19


-----

###### • On 31 March 2020, the registered corporate name of Eurotunnel Project SAS was changed to JV-G-ING SAS and on the same date the Issuer transferred 50% of its shares in JV-G-ING SAS to a third party in exchange for a consideration at par value. From that date, the JV-G-ING SAS is consolidated into the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group using the equity method at 50%. On 30 September 2020, JV-G-ING SAS changed its registered corporate name to Kinesis SAS.

 • RDGL Rail SAS (commercial name “Régionéo”) was registered on 27 July 2020 as a 45%/55% joint venture between the Issuer and RATP Dev to respond to calls for tenders for regional passenger rail transport as part of the opening up to competition of the rail market in France. RDGL Rail SAS is consolidated by the Group using the equity method at 45%.

 (b) Activities

 (1) Training: CIFFCO

 CIFFCO is a railway training centre, which is a technical resource to support the Group’s growth as the Tunnel Concessionaire and a railway business. The CIFFCO training centre is open to all rail operators, infrastructure managers and industrial companies for the training of their staff, enabling stakeholders to benefit from the Group’s expertise (see Chapter 6 of Annex A).

 (2) Property business: Euro-Immo GET

 As an extension of its mission to design and operate the Fixed Link (see Section 1.2.2.c.ii of Annex A), the Group was given responsibility for local land development. As part of such responsibility and in order to further boost the appeal of the Calais area as a tourist destination, Euro-Immo GET SAS was awarded on 18 February 2013 the land development concession for a period of 10 years for the integrated seaside eco-village and golf resort project at the Porte des Deux Caps. The development of this area encompasses all the work relating to roads, networks, open spaces and various facilities designed to meet the needs of the future occupiers, owners, inhabitants and users of new buildings. 

 On 12 July 2013, the declaration of public utility for the project was granted by a prefectoral order for a five-year period (subsequently extended on 28 June 2018 for a further five-year period). GDEAM-62 (a group created to protect the environment in the Montreuil-sur-Mer district) filed an objection with the Administrative Court of Lille on 20 January 2014 seeking the cancellation of that order. In a ruling of 24 January 2017, the court dismissed the objection as unfounded. However, following an appeal by GDEAM-62, on 3 July 2019, the Administrative Appeal Court of Douai cancelled the lower court’s judgment and accepted GDEAM-62’s claims by cancelling both the prefectoral order of 12 July 2013 and the implicit decision to dismiss its appeal. The Ministere de la cohesion des territoires et des relations avec les collectivites territoriales (the French Ministry of Territorial Cohesion and Territorial Communities Relationships) appealed to the Conseil d’État on 28 August 2019 against this appeal decision and Euro-Immo GET also filed an appeal on 3 September 2019 and made a supplementary submission on 3 December 2019. On 22 July 2020, the Conseil d’État rejected those appeals. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Group is analysing its options. 

 (3) Euro Carex

 The Group is involved in the Euro Carex project via its subsidiary London Carex Limited. The Paris Charles de Gaulle, Lyon Saint Exupery and Liege airports have linked up with logistics companies including FedEx and TNT to try to encourage a transfer of air freight onto the European high-speed railway network. London Carex is part of this umbrella organisation, the Euro Carex association, tasked with developing the British end of the network. The Carex concept is similar to a cargo aircraft running on rail: high-speed trains that have been modified to carry air freight containers. In 2017, the association launched a tender for a European business plan. The study began in 2017 and confirmed the existence of a market. Initial contacts made in Germany were continued. The recent debates on the carbon footprint generated by air transport have boosted the interest of airports and freight-forwarders in this project to transfer air freight onto the European high-speed railway network. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of air freight for the world’s economy, whilst rail freight has been far less affected than passenger transport: both very favourable factors for this project.

 In 2018, Trenitalia launched a service based on the same concept as Carex between northern and southern Italy. Carex has made a number of contacts, with a view to Trenitalia becoming part of the project. In 2020, Lyon airport became a direct member of Euro Carex and Groupe ADP (Paris airports) have stated their intention to do the same in 2021, which demonstrates their commitment to the project.

###### 1.3 The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s business and operating results in H1 2021

 In December 2019, the emergence of a new strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China that has subsequently spread across the world, including Europe. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak as a pandemic. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and companies around the world have imposed travel restrictions, quarantines and other restrictive measures. These measures, as well as a dramatic reduction in consumer spending, have had a material negative impact on the world’s economy: for example, in 2020, the U.S. GDP decreased by 3.5%, the UK’s GDP decreased by 9.9% and the Eurozone’s GDP decreased by 6.6%, respectively (Sources: Eurostat, national statistics). The European economy continued to shrink in the first quarter of 2021, and remains smaller than pre-pandemic levels despite a partial rebound of the European economy in the second quarter of 2021 due to the partial lifting of COVID-19-related restrictions. In the first quarter of 2021, the GDP of the UK and the Eurozone decreased by 1.6% and 0.3%, respectively, before rebounding to growth of 4.8% and 2.2%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021 (Sources: Eurostat, national statistics).

 1.3.1 Impact on H1 2021 results

 As discussed in detail in Notes A.1 and D.6 of Annex B, the strict population containment and movement restriction measures put in place in 2020 by the French and the British governments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic continued during the first half of 2021. 

 The public health crisis and the measures taken by the governments had a very significant negative impact on the Group’s traffic and internal organisation during H1 2021, in particular with regards to the Eurotunnel, which continued to experience a sharp fall in traffic in H1 2021, particularly on Passenger Shuttles and in the number of Eurostar passengers. In the Eurotunnel segment: (i) Passenger Shuttle traffic decreased by 76% in January and February 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and decreased by 55% in H1 2021 compared to H1 2020 and (ii) Eurostar continued to operate a severely reduced timetable, with a 96% decrease in the number of passengers using its trains passing through the Tunnel in January and February 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and a 90% decrease in H1 2021 compared to H1 2020. In the four month period from March to June, when travel restrictions were in place in both 2020 and 2021, Passenger Shuttle traffic decreased by 24% and Eurostar passenger numbers decreased by 65% in 2021 compared to the respective period in 2020.

 The Truck Shuttle business was less affected than the Eurotunnel segment’s other activities in the first half of 2021 than in 2020, in particular because of the exemption from the rules applicable to international travel for certain categories of workers, including lorry drivers. Truck Shuttle traffic decreased by 3% in H1 2021 compared to H1 2020, but increased by 15% for the four-month period from March to June 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.

 The Europorte segment’s business, which was impacted at the beginning of January 2020 by the SNCF Réseau strike and in H1 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, saw a return to normal order volumes in 2021 with an acceleration in the development of cross-border flows with Belgium and Germany with the launch of the Flex Express service. In H1 2021, Europorte recorded an increase in revenue of €8 million, or 14%, to €66 million in H1 2021 compared to €58 million in H1 2020.

 Primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s revenue decreased from €369 million in H1 2020 to €326 million in H1 2021, or by 12%. The Group’s EBITDA in H1 2021 was down by €157 million compared to the Group’s pre-COVID-19 reference period of H1 2019.

 1.3.2 Impact on Q3 2021 traffic and revenue

 For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s traffic and revenue in Q3 2021, see “— Recent Developments—Trading update—Q3 traffic and revenue update”.

 1.3.3 The Group’s response

 The Group took a series of measures to secure the health and safety of its customers and personnel, whilst ensuring the continuation of movement of goods and people and preserving its profitability and cash flow capabilities. These measures include:

 • measures to protect the Group’s employees and ensure the continuity of essential functions and a continuous monitoring system was set up in consultation with staff representatives;

 21


-----

###### • adapting Shuttle and Europorte capacity and operating plans in response to the decline in traffic while implementing specific measures to ensure the health and safety of the Group’s customers and maintain the quality of its service;

 • furloughing of employees (in line with measures put in place by the French and British governments), initially from March to June 2020 and then again from October 2020, which covered almost all of the Group’s staff in France and approximately one-third of its UK workforce; these measures came to an end on 30 September 2021 for the Group’s personnel in Britain. Following several negotiation meetings between management and the Eurotunnel Services GIE trade union delegates concerning the implementation of a long- term partial activity agreement for French Eurotunnel employees, an agreement was reached and signed by General Confederation of Labour—Workers’ Force (Confédération Générale du Travail—Force Ouvrière) and French Confederation of Management–General Confederation of Executives (Confédération française de l'encadrement—Confédération générale des cadres) on 30 September 2021. This agreement has been approved by the Regional Directorates for the Economy, Employment, Labor and Solidarity (Directions régionales de l’économie, de l’emploi, du travail et des solidarités, or “DREETS”) for implementation and therefore it can be applied retroactively from 1 September 2021. On 19 October 2021, the Group also launched voluntary departure processes in the UK and France;

 • an initiative by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, members of the Board of Directors and the management team to reduce their remuneration during the periods most affected by the crisis;

 • implementation of the Group’s Shield Plan (“Shield Plan”) aimed at achieving substantial savings in operating expenses compared to 2019 levels and optimising capital expenditure to reduce cash outflows, while preserving investments in safety and maintenance;

 • postponement of a significant portion of the Group’s capital expenditure planned for 2020 and 2021, whilst ensuring that neither the safety nor the continuity of operations of its services were impacted (although the Group does not believe that this will jeopardise its wider capital expenditure programme adopted in 2019, which is focused on strengthening its quality of service and modernising its infrastructure and equipment); and

 • withdrawal (announced on 3 April 2020) of the Group’s proposal to distribute its 2019 dividend.

 Other than the above furloughing measures, the Group has voluntarily limited its recourse to other aid and financial measures put in place by the French and British governments to help companies in difficulty during the crisis so as not to be constrained in its decisions by state directives. Nevertheless, like most players in the international transport sector, the Group has requested a deferral of the payment of its business rates from the British government. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the British government has not responded to this request.

 As a result of these measures, the Group has been able to continue to honour its debt service obligations during the period and continues to have significant liquidity, with net cash available as at 30 June 2021 of approximately €549 million, enabling it to cover its debt service over the remainder of 2021 and to finance its activities.

 1.4 Brexit

 Following the decision of the United Kingdom’s referendum on 23 June 2016 to leave the European Union and the triggering of Article 50 by the UK government at the end of March 2017, the 11-month transition period (the “Transition Period”) for the United Kingdom’s official exit from the European Union ended on 31 December 2020. The new procedures for managing vehicle and goods control on entry to the EU have been in place since 1 January 2021 at the Coquelles terminal. Truck Shuttle traffic was impacted in the first months of 2021 by the adaptation of its customers to these new administrative rules for crossing the UK-France border.

 During the first half of 2021, the UK government announced the postponement of the application of the new provisions relating to border controls on entry to the UK. The new provisions will be progressively implemented from 1 October 2021 to March 2022, with the majority of the provisions applying at the border from 1 January 2022. 

 The Group has taken extensive measures to prepare for the consequences of Brexit by developing innovative solutions in order to offer the best possible service to all its customers. It has designed, in collaboration with the French customs authorities, an intelligent border system to maintain the fluidity of border crossings, the Eurotunnel Border Pass. This system allows the carrier to provide the documents required by French Customs before boarding, namely at the point of registering the journey in the Eurotunnel information system. When the driver arrives at the Eurotunnel terminal, the

 22


-----

###### information already collected is transmitted in real time to the French Customs information system, which can then decide on any exit checks that may be required on the French side. However, the effectiveness of these systems depends on having enough staff available in the control authorities.

 Despite the remaining uncertainties regarding the ongoing post-Brexit relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the Group, in view of all its preparatory measures already implemented and designed to maintain fluidity of passage through its terminals, remains confident in its ability to ensure optimal management of traffic flows on the sites.

 On 1 September 2021, the Group announced a 25-year contract with Colt Technology Services (“Colt”) pursuant to which Colt will install its IQ fibre-optic network through the Tunnel (the “Colt Agreement”). The Colt Agreement is expected to generate a minimum of €185 million for the Group over its duration, with more than a third secured over the first five years. Colt will carry out the installation and operation of its IQ network in accordance with the Tunnel’s safety and security regulations, while the Group will be responsible for maintenance. Colt will fully commercialise the Group’s Eurotunnel optic fibre and increase the Group’s internal telecommunications capacity.

###### (c) Unaccompanied rail freight transport services

 In September 2021, the Group launched a new unaccompanied rail freight transport service across the Short Straits, from Calais to Ashford. The service operates 24 hours a day and six days per week, with departures from the Group's two terminals in Calais and Folkestone. Capacity is expected to be 8,300 trailers per year and this new service will emit 40 times less CO2 than ferries and is expected to prevent 8,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. The launch of this unaccompanied freight service also makes it possible to help alleviate the shortage of truck drivers in the UK and Europe as well as to relieve traffic congestion on motorways. 

 Eurotunnel has signed a partnership with CargoBeamer for a new rail service extending the rolling motorway from Perpignan to Ashford, which is a logical step in developing a future international intermodal network between the Channel and the Mediterranean. A second route from Domodossola, in the Alps region, to Calais will also be extended to Ashford after its launch in October.

 The service benefits from the Group’s unique customs expertise and the crossing is managed by Eurotunnel Le Shuttle Freight. The Group’s Eurotunnel Border Pass allows transporters to speed up the border crossing by digitising their administrative exchanges with the border authorities. Eurotunnel was awarded the Best Innovation Award in September 2021 at the SITL 2021 Exhibition (Transport and Logistics Innovation Week) in Paris in the category Technologies, IOT et Systèmes d’Information for its Eurotunnel Border Pass.

 1.5.2 Governance

 Further to the shareholders’ general meeting on 28 April 2021, Yann Leriche, the Issuer’s Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Cornwall, the Issuer’s UK staff representative, were appointed to the Issuer’s board of directors.

 1.6 The Transactions

 The gross proceeds from the Offering are expected to be €150.0 million.

 The Issuer intends to use the gross proceeds of the Offering (i) to fund Eligible Green Assets and (ii) to pay fees and expenses in relation to the foregoing (collectively, the “Transactions”).

 For a description of the Group’s anticipated debt following the issuance of the Additional Notes and the application of the net proceeds thereof, see “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”, “Description of Additional Notes”, “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalisation”.

 • be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including interest payables, trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.

 Green Assets and (ii) to pay fees and expenses in relation to the foregoing. See “Use Of Proceeds”. Optional Redemption ........................ At any time prior to 30 October 2022, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the

See “Description of Additional Notes—Optional Redemption Upon Equity Event”. At any time prior to 30 October 2022, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date plus the applicable “make whole” premium.

###### SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

 The following tables present the Group’s summary financial information as at and for each of FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020, H1 2020 and H1 2021 and should be read in conjunction with the information in Annex A (and the Annual Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Annex A) and Annex B. The French versions of the Annual Financial Statements were audited by KPMG Audit, a division of KPMG SA, and Mazars SA, as set forth in their audit reports thereon, and were prepared in accordance with IFRS. The French version of the Interim Financial Statements was reviewed by KPMG Audit, a division of KPMG SA, and Mazars SA, as set forth in their review report thereon, and was prepared in accordance with IAS 34.

 The following tables also include certain financial information for the twelve months ended 30 June 2021. Such financial information has been computed by adding the number for H1 2021 to the number for FY 2020 and subtracting from the resulting total the number for H1 2020, in each case, in the relevant line item. These numbers are provided for convenience only and are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data—Historic Financial Information of the Group—LTM Financial Information”.

 This section includes certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS, because the Group believes they provide investors with useful additional information to measure the Group’s performance, liquidity or capital expenditures. These non-IFRS financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data—Historic Financial Information of the Group—Non-IFRS financial measures”.

 The following tables also include certain unaudited consolidated financial information that has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on 30 June 2021 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted balance sheet items and (ii) on 1 July 2020 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted finance costs and other financial ratios. The unaudited Group as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Group’s financial position or finance costs or other as adjusted financial ratios would have been if the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom had occurred on such dates, nor do they purport to project the Group’s net debt or finance costs at any future date.

 The summary financial and other information set out below should also be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Data”, “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalisation” included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

###### RISK FACTORS

 An investment in the Additional Notes involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Additional Notes is suitable for them in light of the risks described below and other information in this Offering Memorandum and their personal circumstances. The occurrence of any of the following events could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on the Group’s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition and impair the Group’s ability to fulfil its obligations in respect of the Notes, potentially causing a loss of all or part of the investment made when purchasing the Additional Notes.

 The risk factors described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all relevant risks and should be used as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Group, or that the Group currently deems immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.

 This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on assumptions and estimates, and subject to risks and uncertainties. The Group’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.

 RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY OF THE GROUP

 The COVID-19 pandemic and any future public health crisis and threats could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.

 In December 2019, the emergence of a new strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China that has subsequently spread across the world, including Europe. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak as a pandemic. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world have imposed travel restrictions, quarantines and other restrictive measures. These measures, as well as a dramatic reduction in consumer spending, have had a material negative impact on the world’s economy: for example, in 2020, the U.S. GDP decreased by 3.5%, the UK’s GDP decreased by 9.9% and the Eurozone’s GDP decreased by 6.6%, respectively (Sources: Eurostat, national statistics). The European economy continued to shrink in the first quarter of 2021, and remains smaller than pre- pandemic levels despite a partial rebound of the European economy in the second quarter of 2021 due to the lifting of partial COVID-19-related restrictions. In the first quarter of 2021, the GDP of the UK and the Eurozone decreased by 1.6% and 0.3%, respectively, before rebounding to growth of 4.8% and 2.2%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021 (Sources: Eurostat, national statistics).Traffic restrictions, containment measures and quarantine requirements imposed by the French, British, Dutch and Belgian governments in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the Group’s traffic and revenue during 2020 and H1 2021, particularly those of the Eurotunnel segment. For a detailed discussion of those negative effects, see “Summary—The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s business and operating results” and “Summary—Recent developments—Trading update—Traffic numbers”.

 The full impact of those effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the French, UK and broader Eurozone economies is not yet known. Even though many COVID-19-related restrictions in France and the UK were gradually lifted in the first half of 2021, significant international travel restrictions remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall French, UK and broader Eurozone economies and, in turn, the Group’s operations. In addition, although the Group has implemented significant measures to safeguard the health, safety and well-being of its employees and ensure continuity of its operating activities, those could prove insufficient should the COVID-19 pandemic persist for considerable time or a second wave of the health crisis materialises in Europe. For example, this can put additional pressure on the Eurotunnel segment’s traffic numbers and related revenue. In addition, if a significant portion of the Group’s workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s operations could be further materially impacted. The Group may also be unable to perform fully on its contracts.

 The outlook for the world economy following the outbreak of COVID-19 remains subject to unprecedented uncertainty and such uncertainty may be prolonged in the markets in which the Group operates. A renewed or future financial recession in the European Union, France or UK could lead to an adverse impact on demand for the Group’s services, its capital expenditure plans and on its operating results. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by UK, French and European Union institutions could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilisation of the European Union or its institutions or arrangements put in place between the UK and European countries in relation to Brexit. It is unclear whether measures taken by European

 34


-----

###### Union institutions, the French government or the UK government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are, or will be, adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. The Group cannot guarantee that the COVID-19 pandemic or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects the Group’s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition depends on several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in the countries, in which the Group operates, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating conditions will stabilise and recover in the countries where the Group operates, including France and the UK. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response thereto, including further quarantine measures. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Group’s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition, as well as its ability to perform its obligations under the Additional Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section or Annex A.

 SEE SECTION 3.1 OF ANNEX A FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OTHER MATERIAL RISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY OF THE GROUP.

 RISKS RELATING TO THE GROUP’S DEBT PROFILE, STRUCTURE AND THE NOTES

 The Group’s leverage and debt servicing obligations could materially adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.

 As at 30 June 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Group’s as adjusted net debt would have been €4,311,521 thousand and the Group’s as adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio would have been 14.1x. For computations of the Group’s as adjusted net debt and net debt to EBITDA ratio, see “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Information—As Adjusted Financial Data and Ratios”. The Issuer expects to use the gross proceeds of the Offering (i) to fund Eligible Green Assets and (ii) to pay fees and expenses in relation to the Transactions. See “Use Of Proceeds”, “Capitalisation” and “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

 The Group’s leverage can have important consequences for the Group’s business and operations, including:

 • making it more difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Additional Notes and the Group’s other debt and liabilities;

 • requiring the Group to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on the Group’s debt, thus reducing the availability of the Group’s cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

 • increasing the Group’s vulnerability to a downturn in the Group’s business or economic or industry conditions;

 • placing the Group at a competitive disadvantage compared to the Group’s competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow;

 • limiting the Group’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Group’s business and its industry;

 • negatively impacting credit terms with the Group’s creditors;

 • restricting the Group from exploiting certain business opportunities; and

 • limiting the Group’s ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

 Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations, including under the Additional Notes and otherwise on its business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.

 35


-----

###### The Group may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Additional Notes Issue Date, which indebtedness could further increase the Group’s leverage and may have terms that are more or less favourable than the terms of the Additional Notes and the Group’s other existing indebtedness.

 The Group may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of the Group’s existing debt, to fund any future acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In connection with the Group’s financial strategy, the Group continually evaluates different financing alternatives, and the Group may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation of the Offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Additional Notes Issue Date. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at the Group’s election, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering document. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Additional Notes and the Group’s other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Additional Notes and the Group’s other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favourable than the terms of the Additional Notes or the Group’s other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Group will elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If the Group incurs new debt in addition to the Group’s current debt and the Additional Notes, the related risks that the Group now faces, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, could intensify.

 The Group is subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit its ability to finance the Group’s future operations and capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities.

 Among other things, the Trust Deed limits the Group’s ability to:

 • incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

 • make restricted payments;

 • create or permit to exist certain liens;

 • transfer or sell assets; and

 • consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Group’s assets.

 In addition, the Group’s other financing documents (see “Description of Other Indebtedness”), including the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants that limit the Group’s ability to incur and assume debt and/or require the Group to maintain certain ratios.

 All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of Additional Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness”. These covenants could limit the Group’s ability to finance the Group’s future operations and capital needs and the Group’s ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in the Group’s interest.

 If the Group fails to comply with any of these covenants, the Group could be in default under the Trust Deed and/or the Group’s other financing documents and/or the relevant debt instruments, as the case may be, and the Trustee, the holders of the Additional Notes or the applicable creditors could declare the principal and accrued interest on the Additional Notes or any applicable amounts under such other financing documents due and payable, after any applicable cure period. In addition, any such default could lead to an event of default and acceleration under the Group’s other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Trust Deed. These restrictions could materially adversely affect the Group’s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Group’s best interest. See “Description of Additional Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

###### The Issuer is a holding company and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to meet its obligations under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

 The Issuer is a holding company. The Issuer has no material assets or liabilities other than the Original Notes and its holdings in, and intercompany loans to, its subsidiaries and it has not engaged in any operating activities other than the issuance of the Original Notes. Repayment of indebtedness of the Issuer, including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (when drawn), is dependent on the ability of the Group’s operating companies to make cash available to the Issuer, by dividend distributions, debt repayment, loans or otherwise. The Group’s operating companies may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their ability to, make distributions or advance upstream or downstream loans to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of the Group’s operating companies is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from these companies. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions or other payments from the operating companies of the Group, the Issuer may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the Additional Notes, if there is insufficient liquidity at Issuer level to make the relevant payments.

 The Notes are subordinated to liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.

 The Issuer’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to any debt incurred by the Issuer or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. Any right of the Issuer to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganisation, assignment for the benefit of creditors, marshalling of assets and liabilities or any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of the Issuer’s indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realise proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary). Accordingly, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries. The terms and conditions of the Notes do not prohibit the Issuer’s subsidiaries from incurring such liabilities.

 The Group requires a significant amount of cash to service its debt and sustain its operations. The Group’s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control, and the Group may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt.

 The Group’s ability to make payments on, and to refinance, the Group’s indebtedness, to fund working capital and to make capital expenditures, will depend on the Group’s future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on the success of the Group’s business strategy and on economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the factors discussed, or referenced, in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond the Group’s control.

 The Issuer can provide no assurance that the Group’s business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to the Group to pay its debt, including payments due under the Notes, when due or to fund the Group’s other capital requirements or any operating losses. If the Group’s future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay the Group’s obligations as they mature or to fund the Group’s liquidity needs, the Group may be forced to:

 • reduce or delay the Group’s business activities or capital expenditures;

 • sell assets;

 • obtain additional debt or equity capital;

 • restructure or refinance all or part of the Group’s debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity; or

 • forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.

 The Issuer can provide no assurance that the Group will be able to accomplish these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of the Issuer’s credit rating, which could also harm the Issuer’s ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of the Group’s debt, including the Notes, limit, and any future debt may limit, the Group’s ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of the Group’s indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require the Group to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict the Group’s business and adversely affect the Group’s financial condition or operating results. There can be no assurance that any assets, which the Group

###### could be required to dispose of can be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realised from such sale will be acceptable.

 The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Security.

 Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the Group will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Security securing the Notes.

 As a result of the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, certain amendments and waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement and in relation to the Security will have to be consented to by the required majority of creditors under the relevant indebtedness, including the Notes, the Credit Facilities, other pari passu and subordinated creditors and any outstanding hedging obligations. The required majority will vary with the type of amendment or waiver being sought and there may in certain circumstances be a requirement for unanimity. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security trustee will serve as the Security Trustee for all the secured parties with respect to the Security. The Security Trustee will act with respect to enforcement of the Security only at the direction of those super senior secured creditors whose unpaid amounts and undrawn commitments under the super senior secured liabilities at that time aggregate to more than 66.67% of the total aggregate amount of all of the super senior secured liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) or the pari passu creditors whose outstanding principal amounts (or unpaid amounts and undrawn commitments) at that time aggregate to more than 50% of the total amount of all the pari passu liabilities at that time (the “Majority Pari Passu Creditors”). The Security Trustee will generally act in accordance with the enforcement instructions of the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, but there are situations where it will act in accordance with instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors. It may prove difficult for the holders of any public debt sharing in the Security to give instructions to the Security Trustee in a timely manner or at all, which may lead to the inability of the Security Trustee to obtain instructions from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors and prevent it from taking enforcement or other actions in a timely manner or at all or require the Security Trustee to act in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors instead.

 The Majority Super Senior Creditors or lenders of any other future class of debt that ranks pari passu with the Additional Notes may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Additional Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Additional Notes to do so.

 These arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Security in a manner that results in lower recoveries by the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence an enforcement action against the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Security could otherwise be impaired or reduced.

 Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, if the Security Trustee sells Security comprising the shares of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action, claims under the Additional Notes and the liens over any other assets of such subsidiaries securing the Additional Notes may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness— Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Additional Notes—Security—Release of Security”.

 Creditors under certain Credit Facilities and certain priority hedging liabilities will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Security sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes.

 The obligations under the Original Notes are, and the obligations under the Additional Notes will be, secured on a first priority basis. The Trust Deed also permits the Security to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under certain future Credit Facilities and certain priority hedging obligations will be permitted to have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Security pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Security. As such, in the event of a relevant enforcement action, holders of Notes may not be able to recover on the Security if the outstanding claims under such future Credit Facilities and such hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realised. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Security by any creditor will, after all obligations under such Credit Facilities and such hedging obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes, certain other hedging obligations and any other obligations secured by the Security.

###### The proceeds from the enforcement of the Security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.

 The value of the Security and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Security will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Security in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the economies of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates its business and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Security should not be relied on as a measure of realisable value for such Security. All or a portion of the Security may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, the Issuer cannot assure Noteholders that there will be a market for the sale of the Security, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation.

 Part of the Security comprises pledges of share of Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Limited, which are subsidiaries of the Issuer. Such pledges, shares and ownership interests may be of no value if the relevant subsidiary is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, because all obligations of that entity must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity.

 ElecLink’s exemption under the European Union Electricity Regulation and certifications under Article 9 of Directive 2009/72/CE could be revoked or amended following enforcement by the Security Trustee of the pledge of shares in GET Elec Limited.

 ElecLink currently benefits from a 25-year exemption under the European Union Electricity Regulation (the “ElecLink Exemption”) which is key to the implementation of the business; see “Summary—Business Structure— ElecLink segment—The project”. Once the interconnector is commissioned (which is currently expected to occur in 2022), that exemption will enable the Group to retain the economic value generated by ElecLink, subject to the profit-sharing mechanisms agreed thereunder. Under the terms of the ElecLink Exemption, any change of control (whether direct or indirect) over the ElecLink project needs to be promptly notified to Ofgem in the United Kingdom and CRE in France. Such notification requirement would be triggered if the pledge of shares in GET Elec Limited, which forms part of the Security, is enforced by the Security Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Additional Notes in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Once notified, Ofgem and CRE (in each case, in cooperation with the relevant anti-trust authorities, if necessary) will consider whether such enforcement constitutes a material change in the circumstances, under which the ElecLink Exemption was originally granted.

 In addition, Ofgem and CRE certified ElecLink under the full ownership unbundling model under Article 9 of Directive 2009/72/CE on 11 February 2019 and 31 January 2019, respectively (the “ElecLink Certifications”) which are also necessary to enable ElecLink to operate its business. Pursuant to Article L. 111-4 of the French Energy Code: (i) ElecLink is required to notify CRE of any development that is likely to justify a re-examination of CRE’s ElecLink Certification; and (ii) CRE may, on its own initiative or at the request from the European Commission, carry out a new examination of ElecLink if it considers that any event affecting ElecLink or its shareholders are likely to significantly undermine the independence obligations in Article L. 111-3 of the French Energy Code. Ofgem has similar powers in respect of its ElecLink Certification.

 If enforcement of the GET Elec Limited share pledge by the Security Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Additional Notes in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement is considered a material change for the purposes of the ElecLink Exemption, such exemption could be revoked or amended. In addition, if Ofgem or CRE carry out a re-examination of their respective ElecLink Certifications (or review of relevant independence obligations), it could lead to revocation of, or amendments to, such certifications. Should any of those events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the value of the ElecLink project, which the holders of the Additional Notes could realise on liquidation thereof.

 The Security Trustee may require the approval of the French regulatory authorities in order to enforce the share pledges over the shares of Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Limited.

 Under French foreign investment regulations, investments made in France by non-French investors are subject to the prior authorisation of the French Minister of Economy if two criteria are met:

 • the investment is either (i) an acquisition of control, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code (which covers indirect control), of a entity governed by French law or (ii) an acquisition of all or part of a branch of activity of an entity governed by French law or (iii), for non-EU investors (i.e. individuals from outside European Union (“EU”) or EEA or entities having their registered office outside EU or EEA), the acquisition, directly or indirectly, whether acting alone or in concert, of more than 25% of the voting rights of an entity governed by French law (the 25% threshold is lowered until 31 December 2021 to 10% of voting rights for non-EU investors acquiring shares in French listed companies);

 39


-----

###### • the investment is made in strategic sectors, which are listed in art. R. 151-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code. Among these sectors are activities relating to equipment, products or services, which are critical to the French public order, public safety or national security (such as energy and water supply, public health, the operation of transport networks and services and electronic communication). Given the industries in which Eurotunnel Holding SAS operates, Eurotunnel Holding SAS might be regarded as operating in a said strategic sector.

 When a foreign investment is subject to clearance by the Minister for the Economy, the transaction cannot be completed without such authorisation. As from the date on which the filing is considered as being complete, the Minister for the Economy has thirty business days to complete an initial review during a Phase I. At the end of this Phase I, the Minister for the Economy may either clear the foreign investment, or commence a forty-five-business-day investigation phase (or Phase II). If no answer is received by the end of any of these phases, the authorisation is deemed to have been refused.

 This requirement may affect enforcement of Security insofar as it comprises the pledge of shares in Eurotunnel Holding SAS. The Issuer can provide no assurance that the approval of the French Minister of Economy would not be required in order to allow the Security Trustee to enforce Security constituting shares of Eurotunnel Holding SAS or that such approval, if required, will be granted.

 The security interests in the Security will be granted to the Security Trustee rather than directly to the holders of the Additional Notes.

 The security interests in the Security were not granted directly to the holders of the Original Notes and will not be granted directly to the holders of the Additional Notes, but were granted (in respect of the Original Notes) and will be granted (in respect of the Additional Notes) only in favour of the Security Trustee. The Trustee for the Notes, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, entered into the Intercreditor Agreement with among others, the Security Trustee. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security Documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Security by the Security Trustee. As a consequence, holders of the Additional Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Security, except through the Security Trustee, who will follow instructions as set forth under the caption “—The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Security”. In addition, in certain circumstances, lenders under certain Credit Facilities will have the right to direct the Security Trustee in enforcement actions with respect to the Security.

 Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the secured parties have appointed the Security Trustee to act as security trustee for the purpose of taking, registering (or causing to register), managing and enforcing any Security granted under the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim under the Security Documents governed by French law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt obligations in favour of the Security Trustee (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer (as principal obligor) towards the holders of the Notes under, or in connection with, the Trust Deed (the “Principal Obligations”).

 Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognised, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 no 10 25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

 To the extent that the security interests in the Security created for the benefit of the Security Trustee as the Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Security. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Trustee as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

 The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Trust Deed that become particularly important following defaults or events of default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee receives written notice, and subsequently acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

 The concept of “trust” has been recognised by the French tax code (Code géneral des impôts) (“French Tax Code”) and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to

 40


-----

###### above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 no 10 25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the New York law could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard (sauvegarde) proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of 1 July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognised under French law.

 Secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event they decide to enforce a pledge over securities of the French subsidiary of the Issuer by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Security consisting of such securities rather than by a sale of such Security in a public auction.

 Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) in connection with a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors); or (y) by way of the judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of non-judicial private attribution (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Additional Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method.

 If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of attribution (whether judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) or private attribution (pacte commissoire)), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) or by an expert pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge in the context of a private attribution (pacte commissoire). In any event, if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the pledged assets as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Security.

 Consequently, in the event that the lenders or investors under certain Credit Facilities and the holders of the Additional Notes are entitled to, and decide to, enforce the Security, which includes a pledge over the securities of Eurotunnel Holding SAS, through judicial or private attribution, and the value of such securities exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the lenders or investors under certain Credit Facilities and the holders of the Additional Notes may be required to pay immediately to the relevant pledgors a “soulte” equal to the amount, by which the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt.

 If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

 Alternatively, the lenders under certain Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes could decide to undertake the sale of the pledged securities by public auction. As public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of Eurotunnel Holding SAS as a going concern.

 The rights of Noteholders in the Security may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Security.

 Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets may not be enforceable or its priority retained, if certain actions are not undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security (including the registration of such security). The security interests securing the Notes may not be enforceable or priority retained if actions required to perfect any of these security interests are not taken.

 The insolvency laws of France may not be as favourable as insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which you are familiar and may limit or preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.

 The Issuer is organised under the laws of France. Main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer could be required to proceed under the laws of the jurisdiction in which its “centre of main interests” (as defined in Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is situated at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced. Although there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interests” will be in the EU member state jurisdiction where its registered office is situated, this presumption is not conclusive. Accordingly, main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer may proceed under, and be governed by French insolvency laws or potentially by the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction if the “centre of main interests” of the Issuer is determined to be in such other

 41


-----

###### jurisdiction at the relevant time. The insolvency laws of such jurisdictions may not be as favourable to your interests as those of the United Kingdom or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar. See “Certain Insolvency And Enforceability Considerations” for a description of the insolvency laws in France, which could limit the enforceability of the Security.

 In the event that the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it would not be possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the security interests in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

 Applicable law and other limitations on the enforceability of the Security may adversely affect its validity and enforceability.

 The obligations of the Issuer under the Original Notes are, and under the Additional Notes will be, subject to the restrictions and limitations detailed herein, secured by the Security. The Security may be subject to claims that it should be limited or subordinated in favour of the Group’s existing and future creditors under any applicable law. In addition, enforcement of the Security will be limited to the extent of the amount that can be secured by the Issuer without rendering the Security voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. Enforcement of the Security against the Issuer will be subject to certain defences available to security providers generally. These laws and defences include those that relate to insolvency, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalisation and defences affecting the rights of creditors generally.

 Events of default may occur without the knowledge of the Trustee if the Issuer fails to notify the Trustee of such event.

 The Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that the Trustee and the Security Trustee are entitled to assume, unless it is otherwise disclosed to it in its capacity as the Trustee or the Security Trustee, respectively, or it is expressly informed otherwise, that no Default or Event of Default (as defined in “Description of Additional Notes”) has occurred and is continuing. The Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, respectively, are not required to monitor whether any such event has occurred. The Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, respectively, are not obliged to make any such determinations and shall be able to conclusively rely on any document provided to it without being obliged to enquire as to the accuracy or validity of any such document. If the Issuer fails to notify the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, respectively, of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, it is likely that neither the Trustee nor any secured creditor including the holders of the Notes would know that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred, the occurrence of which may indicate that the Issuer or the Group as a whole is experiencing financial or other difficulties. The absence of such notice may result in the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, and any secured creditor being unable to enforce their rights in a timely manner, potentially resulting in greater losses on their investment that would have been the case had such notice of default been given by the Issuer when such notice might have first been delivered.

 Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments.

 The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisors to determine whether, and to what extent, the Additional Notes are legal investments for it. The Additional Notes can be used as security for indebtedness and other restrictions apply to the purchase or pledge of any of the Additional Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Additional Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

 Many of the covenants in the Trust Deed will cease to apply if the Notes are rated investment grade.

 Many of the covenants contained in the Trust Deed governing the Notes will cease to apply to the Notes and will be terminated and permanently cease to have effect beginning on the day that the Notes are rated investment grade, provided that at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants will include restrictions on, among other things, the Group’s ability to make certain distributions, incur indebtedness and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade or that if the Notes ever are rated investment grade they will maintain these ratings. However, termination of these covenants would allow the Group to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force. See “Description of Additional Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenants Fall Away”.

-----

###### Early redemption of the Notes may reduce the yield expected by the holders of the Notes.

 The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer as described in “Description of Additional Notes—Optional Redemption”. In the event that the Issuer exercises its option to redeem the Notes, the holders of the Notes may suffer a lower than expected yield and may not be able to reinvest the funds on the same terms.

 The Group may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.

 The Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” in relation to the Issuer. Upon the occurrence of a “change of control triggering event”, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. If a change of control triggering event were to occur, the Issuer can provide no assurance that the it will have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes and any other indebtedness with similar provisions.

 In addition, the Group’s other indebtedness (including the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to certain events or transactions that could constitute a change of control under the terms of the Trust Deed or other indebtedness. The inability to purchase the Notes or repay such other indebtedness upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event would constitute an event of default under the terms and conditions governing the Notes and such other indebtedness, which would trigger a cross-acceleration under the Notes and vice versa. See “Description of Additional Notes—Change Of Control”.

 Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.

 One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, the market, other risk factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of the Group’s financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

 Credit rating agencies other than the Rating Agencies could seek to rate the Notes without having been requested to do so by the Issuer. If such unsolicited ratings are lower than the comparable ratings assigned to the Notes by the Rating Agencies, those unsolicited ratings could have an adverse effect on the value of the Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, any references to ratings or rating in this Offering Memorandum are to ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies only.

 Transfers of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions.

 The Issuer has not agreed to register and does not intend to register the Notes under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The holders of the Notes may not offer to sell the Notes, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The Issuer has not undertaken to register the Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered and does not intend to register the Notes under any other country’s securities laws. Prospective investors in the Notes should read the discussion in the section entitled “Notice to Investors” for further information about these transfer restrictions. It is the obligation of the investors in the Notes to ensure that their subscription for or subsequent offers, sales or transfers of the Notes comply with any applicable securities laws.

 The market value of the Notes could decrease if the Group’s creditworthiness worsens.

 The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives the Group to be less likely to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due. This could occur, for example, because of the materialisation of any of the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section. Even if the Group’s ability to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different perception. In addition, market participants’ estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the same business as the Group could adversely change, causing the market value of the Notes to fall. If any of these events occurs,

 43


-----

###### third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than before the materialisation of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes could decrease.

 There is no assurance that the holders of the Additional Notes will be able to sell them.

 Although an application has been made to list the Additional Notes on the Global Exchange Market, there can be no guarantee of the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Additional Notes, the ability of the holders of the Additional Notes to sell such Additional Notes or the price at which they may be able to sell such Additional Notes. Liquidity and future trading prices of the Additional Notes depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, operating results, the market for similar securities and general economic conditions. The Initial Purchasers have informed the Group that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes after completing the Offering. They are not, however, obligated to do so. Any market-making that is commenced may be halted at any time. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in the Group’s financial performance in the markets in which the Group operates may adversely affect the liquidity of any trading market in the Additional Notes that does develop and any market price quoted for the Additional Notes. As a result, the Group cannot ensure that an active trading market will actually develop for the Additional Notes.

 Historically, markets for non-investment grade debt, such as the Notes, have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such debt. Any market for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes independent of the Group’s financial performance and prospects and may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes.

 The Notes may not remain listed on the Global Exchange Market.

 Although the Issuer intends to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Global Exchange Market as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure prospective investors that the Additional Notes will become or that the Notes will remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing of the Notes on the Global Exchange Market or it becomes unduly onerous to maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to maintain such listing on the Global Exchange Market, provided that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognised listing exchange for high yield issuers, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Global Exchange Market or another recognised listing exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with the Trust Deed, the delisting of the Notes from the Global Exchange Market or another stock exchange in accordance with the Trust Deed may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

 Prospective investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Additional Notes.

 The Additional Notes are denominated and payable in Euros. If prospective investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than Euros, an investment in the Additional Notes entails foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the Euros, relative to the currency by reference to which such prospective investors measure their returns because of economic, political or other factors over which the Group has no control. Depreciation of the Euros, against the currency by reference to which prospective investors measure their respective investment returns could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Additional Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return of the Additional Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure their investment returns. There may be tax consequences for prospective investors as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses for any investment in the Additional Notes. Please see “Tax Considerations”.

 The Additional Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore prospective investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.

 Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form, represented by Individual Note Certificates, are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests in the Global Note will not be considered owners or the holders of the Additional Notes. The common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream or their respective nominees will be the registered holders of the Global Note. After payment to Euroclear or Clearstream, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.

 Accordingly, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if it is not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, on the procedures of the participant through which it owns its interest, to exercise any rights and obligations as a holder of the Additional Notes. See

 44


-----

###### “Book-Entry; Delivery And Form”. Unlike the holders of the Additional Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from the holders of the Additional Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, or if applicable, from a participant in these systems. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable investors to vote on any matters or otherwise exercise their rights with respect to the Additional Notes on a timely basis.

 Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default, unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if an investor owns a book-entry interest it will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer can provide no assurance that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of the investors’ rights under the Additional Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery And Form”.

 The Additional Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors.

 Each potential investor in the Additional Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

 • have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the merits and risks of investing in the Notes;

 • have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Additional Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;

 • have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Additional Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor’s currency;

 • understand thoroughly the terms of the Additional Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and

 • be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect their investment and their ability to bear the applicable risks.

 Potential investors should not invest in the Additional Notes unless they have the expertise (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Additional Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Additional Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall investment portfolio.

 The Additional Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets.

 On 15 October 2020, DNV provided an opinion (the “DNV GL Second Party Opinion”) assessing the alignment of the Notes with the 2018 Green Bond Principles. The DNV GL Second Party Opinion is not incorporated into, and does not form part of, this Offering Memorandum. Neither the Issuer, nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to (i) the suitability of any opinion or certification of any third party (whether or not solicited by the Issuer) or the Notes to fulfil any environmental and sustainability criteria; (ii) whether the Notes will meet investor criteria and expectations with regard to environmental impact and sustainability performance; (iii) whether the net proceeds will be used to finance Eligible Green Assets; or (iv) the characteristics of the Eligible Green Assets, including their environmental and sustainability criteria. The DNV GL Second Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. The DNV GL Second Party Opinion is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is only current as at the date that the DNV GL Second Party Opinion was initially issued. Each potential investor in the Notes must make its own determination with respect to the relevance of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum regarding the use of proceeds, and its purchase of Notes should be based upon such investigation as it deems necessary. A withdrawal of the DNV GL Second Party Opinion may affect the value of the Notes and/or may have consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in “green” assets.

###### RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION

 Changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof could negatively affect the Group’s business.

 The Group is subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect the Group’s tax position, including its effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, tax laws and regulations in France, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions where the Group operates are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. The Group often relies on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Group cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with the Group’s interpretation of these laws. If the Group’s tax positions are challenged by the relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require the Group to increase the costs of its products or services to track and collect such additional taxes, which could increase the Group’s costs of operations and negatively affect its business, prospects, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. The Group is subject to tax audits by various local tax authorities. Such tax audits may result in additional tax, interest and penalty payments, which would negatively affect the financial condition and operating results of the Group.

 The proposals of the OECD/ G20 inclusive framework (“IF”) on “base erosion and profit shifting” (“BEPS”) to reform the international corporate tax framework could impact the Group’s tax position in the future. The IF gathers 140 countries and jurisdictions, collaborating to tackle BEPS practices, 136 of which have agreed to join the Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy published by the OECD on 8 October 2021. Pillar 1 aims at aligning taxing rights more closely with local market engagement, through the introduction of new profit allocation mechanisms and nexus rules, while Pillar 2 aims at establishing a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprises.

 The European Union continues to harmonise the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the European Commission published on 18 May 2021 a communication on “business taxation for the 21st century”, which sets out in particular a tax agenda for the next two years. In order to ensure a consistent implementation of Pillars 1 and 2 (as mentioned above) at European Union level, the Commission intends to propose new directives. The Commission also expressed its intention to go beyond the OECD/ G20 agreement. Among the corporate tax reforms proposed in the communication, the Commission announced its plan to propose in 2023 a new framework for business taxation in the European Union, the “Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” (referred to as “BEFIT”), with the aim to move towards a common tax rulebook and provide for new principles on allocations of taxing rights among Member States. BEFIT would be a single corporate tax rulebook for the European Union, based on the key features of a common tax base and the allocation of profits between Member States based in a formulary apportionment. This new proposal will replace the currently pending proposal of a “Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base” (“CCCTB”), which will be withdrawn. If adopted, these new rules at European Union level could impact the Group’s tax position in the future.. In relation to Brexit: following the end of the Transition Period on 31 December 2020, Brexit may have tax implications for the Group, including by reason of European Union tax laws (or other tax laws referencing European Union membership) ceasing to apply in the United Kingdom.

 Finally, political responses to the economic consequences of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic may still include increases in taxes or implementation of new taxes in various jurisdictions.

 The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where the Group operates may impact the financial results of the Group.

 The Council of the European Union adopted on 5 December 2017 its conclusions on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the “Council Conclusions”), which is composed of two sub lists (so called respectively the “Black List” and the “Grey List”, together referred to hereinafter as the “EU List”). The EU List was established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the Council (the “EU Code of Conduct Group”) during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions. The Black List, which shall be updated twice a year from 2020, and was last revised on 5 October 2021, is currently composed of the following nine jurisdictions: American Samoa, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the US Virgin Islands and Vanuatu. The next revision of the Black List is due in February 2022. Furthermore, the Council published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order to comply with the European Union screening criteria. 

 EU Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions. On 5 December 2019, the Council of the European Union endorsed guidance for further coordination which called on EU Member States to apply at least one of the following four legislative defensive measures by 1 January 2021: (i) non-deductibility of costs incurred in a listed jurisdiction; (ii) controlled foreign company rules to limit artificial deferral of tax to offshore, low-taxed entities; (iii) withholding tax measures to tackle

 46

###### improper exemptions or refunds; and (iv) limitation of the participation exemption on shareholder dividends. An overview of defensive measures applied by EU Member States is due to take place by the end of 2021.

 A French law that aims at fighting against tax fraud published on 24 October 2018 (Law # 2018-898 of 23 October 2018) has expanded under certain conditions the French tax regime regarding non-cooperative States or territories (Etats et territoires non coopératifs) (“Non-Cooperative States”) as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code to States and jurisdictions included in the Black List which are now susceptible to qualifying as Non-Cooperative States. As a result, certain punitive measures provided under the French Tax Code may apply to transactions carried out by French tax residents in jurisdictions featuring on the Black List or with parties established in a jurisdiction featuring on the Black List. Notably, interest paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in certain States or jurisdictions included in the Black List or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such States or jurisdictions, may be subject to withholding tax in France and not be deductible for the purposes of the computation of the debtor’s corporate income tax liability. A jurisdiction is not treated as a Non-Cooperative State for French tax purposes just because such jurisdiction features on the Black List—a French administrative order (arrêté) adding such jurisdiction to the French Non-Cooperative States list is required. Then, as from the first day of the third month following the issuance of the administrative order, such jurisdiction is treated as a Non-Cooperative State for French tax purposes. Symmetrically, where a jurisdiction ceases to meet the criteria provided under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, it remains a Non-Cooperative State for French tax purposes until an administrative order removing that jurisdiction from the French Non-Cooperative States list is published. In this case, the removal has immediate effect—i.e., the jurisdiction ceases to be a Non-Cooperative State from the date the administrative order is issued. The French Non-Cooperative States list, which may be updated annually by way of administrative order, was last updated by an administrative order of 26 February 2021 and includes: American Samoa, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, the US Virgin Islands and Vanuatu.

 The Group’s ability to use deferred tax assets may be restricted.

 The Group may record deferred tax assets on its balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from discrepancies between the tax valuation and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss carry-forwards from its entities. The actual realisation of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities. Any reduction in the Group’s ability to use these assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax reassessment, or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on its business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.

 The services that the Group provides are subject to value added taxes that may increase.

 The services that the Group provides to its clients are subject to value added taxes, sales taxes or other similar taxes. Tax rates may increase at any time, and any such increase could affect the Group’s business and the demand for its services, and thus reduce the Group’s operating profit, thereby negatively affecting its business, prospects, operating results or financial condition and cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.

 French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.

 The French Finance Act for 2019 implemented an in-depth reform of the financial expenses deduction rules, transposing into French law the provisions of the ATAD in respect of fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The former 25% general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses (“rabot fiscal”) and Article 209, IX of the French Tax Code (the Amendement Carrez limitation) have been repealed and replaced by a new general limitation mechanism provided under Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code (the “EBITDA Limitation Rule”). In addition, the provisions of Article 212, II of the French Tax Code (i.e., existing thin-capitalisation rules) have been amended, as summarised below.

 The other rules limiting interest deductibility generally remained unchanged, in particular the rules applying to direct shareholder loans and related party loans (Articles 39,1-3° and 212, I-a of the French Tax Code).

 Under Article 39,1-3° of the French Tax Code, where the lender is a direct shareholder of the borrower but does not qualify as a “related party” (within the meaning of Article 39,12 of the French Tax Code) vis-à-vis the borrower, the maximum rate of interest allowed as a deduction (the “Maximum Statutory Rate”) is the annual average market interest rate applied by banking institutions under floating-rate corporate loans having an initial maturity exceeding two years, as published from time to time by the French tax authorities (1.18% for fiscal years ending on 31 December 2020). Interest paid or accrued in excess of this rate is disallowed permanently and reclassified as constructive dividend (and, as such, may be subject to French dividend withholding tax). It is a legal requirement that the borrower’s share capital be fully paid up in order to be able to deduct interest paid to direct shareholders. Pursuant to Article 212, I-a of the French Tax Code,

 47


-----

###### the maximum rate of interest allowed on related party debts is the higher of: (i) the Maximum Statutory Rate; and, (ii) the rate that the borrower could have negotiated with an unrelated bank for a similar borrowing. The deduction of interest paid or accrued in excess of the applicable reference rate is disallowed permanently and reclassified as constructive dividend.

 Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, deductible net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year are capped at the higher of: (i) €3 million; or, (ii) 30% of the company’s EBITDA as adjusted for tax purposes (corresponding to the company’s taxable income for corporate income tax purposes, before the offset of tax losses carried forward and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to a specified extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related party and third-party financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. If a company belongs to a French tax consolidated group, the limitation is applicable at the level of the tax consolidated group (it does not apply to interest expenses between companies belonging to the same tax consolidated group – Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code).

 A safe harbour is provided, which enables the company to further deduct 75% of the net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation, where the company proves that its equity-to-assets ratio equals or is above the equity-to-assets ratio of the accounting consolidation group to which it belongs (the “Accounting Group”).

 Net financial expenses not deducted in any given fiscal year pursuant to the 30% Limitation are carried forward, without time limitation nor erosion (it being specified however that they cannot benefit from the safe harbour in any subsequent fiscal year). The unemployed deduction capacity (unused portion of the EBITDA as adjusted for tax purposes) is carried forward over five years. However, such deduction capacity cannot be used to deduct financial expenses carried forward.

 A lower limitation applies in principle where the company is considered as thinly-capitalised, that is to say where the ratio between (i) the company’s debts vis-à-vis related companies and (ii) the company’s equity (either at the opening or the closing date of the relevant fiscal year) exceeds 1.5 (the “10% Limitation”). In such case, net financial expenses are divided into two baskets, which are subject to different limitations on deduction:

 • the first basket corresponds to a ratio between: (i) at the numerator, the average amount of non-related party debt plus 1.5 times the company’s equity (either at the opening or the closing date of the relevant fiscal year), and (ii) at the denominator, the average amount of the aggregated (related and unrelated party) debts of the company (the “First Ratio”). The deductibility of such portion is capped at the higher of: (1) €3m multiplied by the First Ratio; and, (2) 30% of the adjusted EBITDA of the company, multiplied by the First Ratio;

 • the second basket corresponds to a ratio between: (i) at the numerator, the average amount of related party debts exceeding 1.5 times the company’s equity (either at the opening or the closing date of the relevant fiscal year), and (ii) at the denominator, the average amount of the aggregated (related and unrelated party) debts of the company (the “Second Ratio”). The deductibility of the second basket is capped at the higher of: (1) €1m multiplied by the Second Ratio; and, (ii) 10% of the adjusted EBITDA of the company, multiplied by the Second Ratio.

 The 10% Limitation is not applicable where the company proves that its debt-to-equity ratio is lower than, or equal to, the debt-to-equity ratio of the Accounting Group to which it belongs.

 Where the 10% Limitation applies: (i) the 75% safe harbour does not apply; (ii) the portion of financial expenses not deducted pursuant to the 10% Limitation may be carried forward without time limitation, but only up to [1]/3 of its amount; and, (iii) the unemployed deduction capacity cannot be carried forward.

 This new EBITDA Limitation Rule does not apply (among other exceptions) to financial expenses incurred by concessionaire companies in relation to infrastructure assets acquired or built by them in the frame of the concession, provided that the concession agreement was entered into prior to 29 December 2012.

 Finally, the French Finance Act for 2020 implemented into French law the provisions of the “ATAD 2” directive as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries, for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2020, by introducing Articles 205 B to D in the French Tax Code. The provisions of Article 212,1-b of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former French “anti-hybrid” provisions) have been repealed correspondingly.

 The provisions of Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code aim at combatting the use of hybrid mismatches to avoid taxation (e.g., double deductions in two different jurisdictions, or deduction in a jurisdiction without inclusion in another jurisdiction, resulting from conflicts in the characterisation of financial instruments, payments and entities, and from the allocation of payments) by neutralising such hybrid mismatches, mainly by denying the deduction at the level of

 48


-----

###### the debtor or by imputing taxable income to the recipient. Such limitations almost exclusively apply in situations where payments are made between “associated parties” (as defined for these purposes). However, the rules also recapture payments made between “unassociated parties” where: (i) such payments are made by a French payor and compensate a payment relating to a “hybrid arrangement”; and (ii) the tax advantage allowed by the hybrid mismatch is reflected in the pricing of the arrangement giving rise to the said payments.

 If the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on its indebtedness were to be limited by the aforementioned tax rules provided for by Article 212 bis and/or Article 223 B bis and/or Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code, the Group’s tax burden could increase and therefore negatively impact its financial condition or operating results. In addition, the Group’s cash flows might be negatively impacted should the Issuer have to pay additional amounts under the Notes as a result of the levying of withholding taxes which may be required by applicable law. See also “Description of Additional Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes”.

 The Issuer may redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law.

 All payments made under the Notes can be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any French income tax, provided that they are, and continue to be, officially listed in Ireland in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA States and are admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market.

 In the event that any withholding or deduction is required to be made for, or on account of, tax imposed by a relevant jurisdiction from payments due under the Notes, the Issuer will, subject to certain exceptions, pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Notes after such withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts, which would have been receivable in respect of the Notes in the absence of the withholding or deduction.

 If, as a result of certain changes in tax law in any relevant tax jurisdiction, the Issuer would become obligated to pay additional amounts in respect of the Notes, the Issuer will have the option (but not the obligation) of redeeming all (but not some) of the outstanding Notes in full at 100% of their principal amount together with accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to redeem the Notes in these circumstances. See “Description of Additional Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes”.

###### DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS

 The following descriptions are summaries of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of the Group’s debt and does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents.

 Term Loan

 See Sections 8.2.4 and 8.2.6 of Annex A entitled “The Term Loan and Ancillary Agreements” and “Master Intra-Group Debt Agreement”, respectively.

 Original Notes

 See Sections 8.2.5 and 8.2.6 of Annex A, entitled “Senior Secured Notes Issued as Green Bonds” and “Master Intra-Group Debt Agreement”, respectively.

 Revolving Credit Facility

 The Issuer is a borrower (“Borrower”) under a Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) dated 30 October 2020 (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”).

 Overview and structure

 The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are intending to make available to the Issuer as Borrower a euro revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to €75.0 million. The Borrower shall apply all amounts borrowed by it under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance or refinance, directly or indirectly, the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Restricted Group, including the payment of any interest, fees and other amounts payable in respect of any Pari Passu Liabilities (including the Notes) or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities (as described in “— Intercreditor Agreement” below).

 In addition, the Borrower may request, by delivery of an additional commitments notice to the agent under (and as defined in) the Revolving Credit Facility (the “Agent”), that the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility be increased. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the additional commitments and the Total Commitments may not at any time exceed €100.0 million. Establishment of any additional commitments shall be subject to certain conditions and other requirements set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

 The Revolving Credit Facility will be available for utilisation until the date falling one month prior to the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility (which will be 31 March 2024) (the “Termination Date”) (the period from the date of the Revolving Credit Facility to the date falling one month before the Termination Date being the “Availability Period” of the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility may also be utilised by way of Letters of Credit on the terms set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

 Interest and Fees

 Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a zero per cent. floor) plus margin. The margin under the Revolving Credit Facility is 2.50 per cent. per annum.

 Default interest shall accrue on any overdue interest from the due date up to the date of actual payment at a rate which is 1 per cent. per annum higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Agent. Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount only if, in accordance with article 1342-2 of the French Code civil, that interest is due for a period of at least one year but will remain immediately due and payable.

 A commitment fee is payable to the Agent (for the account of each lender pro rata to their available commitment) at a rate per annum of 40% of the margin applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility on that lender’s available commitment for the Availability Period of the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is payable on the last day of each successive period of three (3) months which ends during the Availability Period, on the last day of the Availability Period and if the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full, on the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time such cancellation is effective.

 53


-----

###### The Borrower is also required to pay an arrangement fee to BNP Paribas as the Arranger in the amount and at the times as separately agreed.

 The Borrower shall pay customary agency fees to the Agent and the Security Trustee in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Repayments

 Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to a rollover mechanism whereby new loans under the Revolving Credit Facility to be drawn on such date are netted against the loans which are required to be repaid, subject to certain conditions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and provided that no event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the making of the new loan.

 All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are required to be repaid on the Termination Date.

 Prepayment

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum amount of €1.0 million). The Borrower may re-borrow amounts repaid or prepaid in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon:

 (a) “change of control” (which comprises, generally, the scenarios set out under the definition of “Change of Control” under the section entitled “Description of Additional Notes—Brief description of Additional Notes—Change of Control”); or

 (b) upon the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions.

 If the Note Purchase Condition applies (see “—Covenants” below), the Borrower must ensure that the amount stipulated under the Note Purchase Condition is applied in prepayment of the Loans in the order of application set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

 Security and guarantees

 The Borrower’s liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a common security package (the “Transaction Security”) on a first priority basis, subject to customary agreed security principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

 Under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any member of the Group which provides a guarantee or security in respect of the Notes or any other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities must provide an equivalent guarantee and Transaction Security in relation to the Revolving Credit Facility.

 Representations and warranties

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being repeated), including status, binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, authorisations and validity and admissibility in evidence.

 Covenants

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related definitions (with certain adjustments) that are discussed in the section entitled “Description of Additional Notes—Certain Covenants.” In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a financial covenant (see “—Financial covenant” below).

 54


-----

###### The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a covenant requiring that the Borrower ensure that the Debt Service Reserve Account is maintained with the Agent and subject to valid security. The Borrower is required to ensure that withdrawals from the Debt Service Reserve Account are only used for the purpose of paying fees and interest on the Secured Obligations after using all other amounts available to the Borrower. The Borrower shall not be entitled, without the consent of the Security Trustee, to withdraw or transfer any credit balance from the Debt Service Reserve Account, provided that the Security Trustee shall consent to any receipts, withdrawals or transfers to the extent that Minimum DSRA Amount (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) is maintained.

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a “notes purchase condition” covenant (the “Note Purchase Condition”). Subject to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Borrower may not, and shall procure that no other member of the Restricted Group will, acquire, repay, prepay, purchase, redeem, defease (or otherwise retire for value), any Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (including the Notes) (or offer to do so). The exceptions to such covenant include, inter alia, that either (A) immediately following such prepayment, purchase, defeasance or redemption (or other retirement for value), the aggregate of the principal amount of Pari Passu Debt Liabilities repaid, prepaid, purchased, defeased or redeemed (or otherwise retired for value) since the date of first utilisation under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (other than from the proceeds of Pari Passu Debt Liabilities) is 50% or less of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes; or (B) to the extent that the aggregate principal amount of such prepayments, purchases, defeasances or redemptions (or other retirements for value) exceeds 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes, the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are cancelled (and, if applicable, utilisations are prepaid) pro rata.

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains certain information undertakings under which the Borrower is required to deliver to the Agent compliance certificates and information regarding the financial condition of the Group and comply with the information undertakings as apply with respect to the Notes.

 Financial covenant

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires the Borrower to comply with a “total net leverage ratio” covenant under which the total net leverage ratio for the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect each 12-month period ending on a “Test Date” (being 30 June and 31 December of each year) (the “Relevant Period”) shall not exceed the ratio set out in column 2 below opposite the Relevant Period.

**Column 2**

**Column 1 Relevant Period** **Ratio**

###### Relevant Period expiring 30 June 2021 ............................................................................................................  15.00:1 Relevant Period expiring 31 December 2021 ...................................................................................................  12.00:1 Relevant Period expiring 30 June 2022 ............................................................................................................  12.00:1 Relevant Period expiring 31 December 2022 and onwards ..............................................................................  10.50:1

 The ratio shall only be tested if on the last day of the Relevant Period, the “Relevant Test Condition” is satisfied (which requires that the aggregate of all utilisations under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of cash and cash equivalent investments held by the Borrower exceeds 35 per cent. of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

 Failure to satisfy the financial covenant shall not constitute a default or event of default but is required to be satisfied as a condition to making drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 Events of default

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains the events of default applicable to the Notes, as set forth in the section entitled “Description of Additional Notes—Events of Defaults and Remedies”.

 In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains the following events of default (subject to customary qualifications and grace periods): non-payment, breach of other obligations, misrepresentation, unlawfulness and invalidity, breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, expropriation, and repudiation or rescission of the “finance documents” entered into in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

 Governing law

 The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law.

###### Intercreditor Agreement

 On 30 October 2020, the Issuer entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with, amongst others, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited as Initial High Yield Note Trustee, BNP Paribas as Revolving Agent and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited as Security Trustee.

 The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

 • the relative ranking of certain debt (including debt incurred under certain Credit Facilities of the debtors);

 • when payments can be made in respect of the subordinated debt of the debtors;

 • when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the subordinated debt;

 • the terms pursuant to which the subordinated debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events; and

 • turnover provisions.

 The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions related to future indebtedness permitted by the Trust Deed that may be incurred by the Issuer and its subsidiaries which may be secured by the collateral securing the Notes, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any finance documentation then existing (including the Trust Deed). Such indebtedness will (i) have equivalent rights to (A) on or prior to the date on which all liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility have been fully and finally discharged, the holders of the Revolving Credit Facility and, following such discharge, any new credit facility (the “Credit Facilities”) and (B) hedge counterparties holding hedging liabilities that have been designated as being a priority hedging liability for the purposes of, and in accordance with the terms of, the Intercreditor Agreement (such hedge counterparties being “Super Senior Hedge Counterparties”), under the Intercreditor Agreement and will vote in the same class of creditors as the holders of the Credit Facilities and the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and certain indebtedness owed to the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties, being the “Super Senior Liabilities”), (ii) have equivalent rights to the holders of the Notes and the hedge counterparties which are not Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in respect of non-priority hedging liabilities (such hedge counterparties being the “Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties”) under the Intercreditor Agreement and will vote in the same class of creditors as the holders of Notes and the Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties in respect of enforcement (such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Notes and certain indebtedness owed to the Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties, being the “Pari Passu Liabilities” and, together with the Super Senior Liabilities, the “Priority Creditor Liabilities”) or (iii) have rights in respect of such indebtedness that will be limited as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the “Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities”) including in respect of (A) when payments in respect of such indebtedness are permitted to be made, including the circumstances when payments in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities can be suspended (including through the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions in respect thereof)), (B) restrictions on when the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities can take enforcement action (including standstill provisions in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities) and (C) the ability of the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities to purchase Priority Creditor Liabilities in certain circumstances.

 By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

 The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

 Ranking and Priority

 The Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) the liabilities owing to the holders of Super Senior Liabilities (as defined therein) and certain agent liabilities rank pari passu in right and priority of payment between themselves and in priority to (A) the liabilities owing to the holders of Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined therein) and certain agent liabilities which rank pari passu in right and priority of payment between themselves and, in turn, in priority to (B) the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities (as defined therein) and (C) all intra-group liabilities owed to intra-group creditors (the “Intra-Group Creditors”), (2) the liabilities owing to the holders of Pari Passu Liabilities rank behind the holders of the Super Senior Liabilities, (3) the liabilities owing to the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities rank behind the holders of the Priority Creditor Liabilities and certain agent liabilities but in priority to the Intra-Group

 56


-----

###### Creditors and (4) the liabilities of the Intra-Group Creditors are postponed and subordinated to the Priority Creditor Liabilities, certain agent liabilities and Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities and the Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank such liabilities as between themselves.

 The holders of the Priority Creditor Liabilities, the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities and the Intra-Group Creditors are referred to as the “Creditors”.

 Guarantees and Security

 The creditors under the Credit Facilities, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Notes and the holders of the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities will benefit from a common guarantee and security package (the “Transaction Security”). The liabilities owing to the Credit Facilities creditors, the hedge counterparties, the holders of the Notes and the holders of the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities would, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be guaranteed by the same debtors to the extent any such guarantee is offered and are secured by the same Transaction Security. To the extent permitted by the Trust Deed, holders of other Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities are entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to receive the benefit of Transaction Security on the basis set forth in “—Priority of Security” below.

 The Intercreditor Agreement contains covenants restricting holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities from taking any additional guarantees or security from the group unless offered to the benefit of all holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities. Unless there is a legal restriction on doing so, the Security Trustee holds the Transaction Security for the benefit of the holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities to the extent each has the benefit of Transaction Security.

 No Transaction Security will become enforceable until the occurrence of an applicable acceleration event.

 Priority of Security

 The Transaction Security ranks and secures the liabilities in respect of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities (to the extent such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities and irrespective of the date on which such Transaction Security was created and/or perfected) in the following order, first the liabilities in respect of Super Senior Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them; secondly the liabilities in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them; and thirdly the liabilities in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them, with the proceeds of the Transaction Security to be applied as described under “—Application of Recoveries” below.

 Entitlement to Enforce Transaction Security

 There are no restrictions on enforcement of Transaction Security by holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities (other than (i) certain restrictions in the case of Super Senior Hedge Counterparties and Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties as described under “—Additional Restrictions” below and (ii) in the case of liabilities owed to any ancillary lenders or issuing banks, enforcement action by these parties is restricted until the final discharge of all other Super Senior Liabilities), provided that no such creditor may enforce Transaction Security other than in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Prior to the final discharge date of all Priority Creditor Liabilities, the holders of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities may only take certain enforcement action against the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries in respect of liabilities in relation to Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities or any Transaction Security (i) if (A) an event of default under any agreement or instrument in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities is continuing (the occurrence of which has been notified to the relevant representative, agents and/or trustees of any Priority Creditor Liabilities by the relevant trustee of the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities) and (B) a period of 179 days has elapsed since the date of such notice referred to in (A) (or such earlier time contemplated in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the applicable event of default referred to in (A) is continuing, or, (ii) in respect of enforcement action in relation to a particular debtor of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities that is the subject of an insolvency event.

 Additional Restrictions

 The Intercreditor Agreement restricts (among other things) with respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries:

 • the ability of the hedge counterparties to take any enforcement action except for certain specified permitted enforcement actions;

 57


-----

###### • the ability of intra-group debtors to pay, prepay, repay, redeem, defease or discharge or acquire intra -group liabilities except for certain specified permitted payments;

 • the ability of the intra-group lenders to take any enforcement action except for certain specified permitted enforcement actions; and

 • the ability of the intra-group lenders to take the benefit of any guarantees or security.

 In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security and guarantees relating to Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities will be released in certain circumstances described further below in “—Release of Security and Guarantees—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals.” Moreover, certain proceeds received by holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities must be turned over to the Security Trustee pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. See further below in “—Turnover.”

 Effect of an Insolvency Event

 After the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the group, any party to the Intercreditor Agreement entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the group in respect of liabilities owed to it shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the group to pay that distribution to the Security Trustee until the liabilities owing to the secured parties have been paid in full. After the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the group, each secured party irrevocably authorises the Security Trustee (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) to:

 (a) exercise any right it may otherwise have in respect of that member of the group with respect to that member of the group’s liabilities to, amongst other things, accelerate any of that member of the group’s liabilities or declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

 (b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member of the group in respect of any liabilities;

 (c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any liabilities of that member of the group; or

 (d) claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the group for such liabilities owing to it.

 Each Creditor shall (a) do all things the Security Trustee (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) requests in order to give effect to the above actions and (b) if the Security Trustee is not entitled to take any of the above actions or requests that a Creditor takes that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Trustee (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) or grant a power of attorney to the Security Trustee to enable it to take such actions.

 Release of Security and Guarantees—Non-Distressed Disposals

 The Security Trustee is permitted to release Transaction Security over any asset if, in respect of a disposal of an asset by a debtor or an asset which is subject to the Transaction Security or a merger, reorganisation or other transaction whereby a release of an asset which is subject to the Transaction Security is required:

 (a) such disposal is not prohibited under the terms of any Credit Facility Agreement;

 (b) the Issuer has certified to the Security Trustee in writing that such disposal and release is not prohibited under the terms of any agreement or instrument in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities or the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities and a director of or the relevant holder of the Pari Passu Liabilities or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities have authorised the release; and

 (c) such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined and set out more fully in “—Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals” below).

 58

###### Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals

 In relation to the disposal of an asset of a member of the group which is (i) being effected at the request of the instructing group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable, (ii) being effected by the enforcement of the Transaction Security or (iii) (in the case of a disposal by a Debtor to a person which is not a member of the group) following an acceleration of Priority Creditor Liabilities (other than under any hedging agreement) and/or Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities or the enforcement of any Transaction Security (a “Distressed Disposal”), the Security Trustee is irrevocably authorised (at the cost of the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, other secured party or debtor) to:

 (a) release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallisation of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Trustee, be considered necessary or desirable;

 (A) the intra-group liabilities; or

 (B) the debtor intra-group receivables,

 1. pursuant to a competitive sales process; or

 2. a fairness opinion in respect of such sale or disposal is obtained and delivered to, amongst others, the Security Trustee.

 If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the requisite majority of holders of the Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities are entitled to give, and have given, enforcement instructions, the Security Trustee is not authorised to release any debtor or any subsidiary or holding company of a debtor from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities owed to any holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other liabilities owing to the holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit or an ancillary facility, made subject to cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant holders of Priority Creditor Liabilities), upon that release.

###### DESCRIPTION OF ADDITIONAL NOTES

 Getlink SE (formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE), a European company with a registered office at 3 rue La Boétie, Paris, France, registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Registry under registration number 483 385 142 (the “Issuer”) will issue €150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Additional Notes”) under a supplemental trust deed dated as of the Additional Notes Issue Date (as defined below) (the “Supplemental Trust Deed”), which supplements the trust deed, originally dated 30 October 2020 (as supplemented, the “Trust Deed”), between the Issuer and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), pursuant to which the Issuer issued €700.0 million in aggregate principal amount 3.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Original Notes”). On the Additional Notes Issue Date (as defined below), the Issuer will enter into a supplemental agency agreement (the “Supplemental Agency Agreement”), which supplements the agency agreement, originally dated 30 October 2020 (as supplemented, the “Agency Agreement”) with The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent, and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch, as registrar and transfer agent. The Additional Notes will be consolidated and treated as a single class with the Original Notes for all purposes under the Trust Deed, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments and redemptions.

 The Security Documents referred to below under the caption “—Security” define the terms of the security interests that will secure the Additional Notes. This “Description of Additional Notes” summarises certain provisions of the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, but does not restate the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents in their entirety. Investors are therefore urged to read the Trust Deed and the Security Documents because they, and not this description, will define their rights as Holders of the Notes. Unless specifically stated otherwise, capitalised terms used, but not defined in this “Description of Additional Notes”, have the meanings given to them in “—Certain Definitions”. Copies of the Trust Deed (which includes the Conditions and the form of Notes) and the Security Documents may be obtained, when available, upon written request, from the Issuer.

 When this “Description of Additional Notes” refers to the “Notes,” its means the Original Notes, the Additional Notes and any Subsequent Additional Notes, as described below under “Subsequent Additional Notes”. The terms and conditions of the Additional Notes are summarised below and are set out in full in the Trust Deed.

 The registered holder of an Additional Note (a “Holder”) will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights in respect of the Additional Notes under the Trust Deed, the Additional Notes and the Security Documents. As described in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”, the Additional Notes will initially be issued in global form deposited with or on behalf of a common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear (each as defined in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) and registered in the name of the nominee of such common depositary. The common depositary will initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch (the “Common Depositary”). Holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights, and the Additional Notes will be subject to transfer restrictions. See “Notice to Investors” and “—Transfer and Exchange”. Each Global Note will contain provisions, which modify the Conditions as they apply to Global Notes. The Additional Notes share the same ISIN numbers and Common Codes as the Original Notes and will be fully fungible with the Original Notes on the Additional Notes Issue Date.

 Brief Description of Notes

 The Additional Notes will:

 • be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

 • rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

 • be secured on an equal and ratable basis with all obligations of the Issuer constituting Pari Passu Liabilities by a first priority Lien on Security; provided, however, that pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of any collection, sale, disposition or other realisation of Security received in connection with the exercise of remedies will be applied first to repay any Super Senior Liabilities (including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any other permitted super senior revolving credit facilities and certain hedging arrangements) prior to the Notes and any other Pari Passu Liabilities;

 • rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer, if any;

 • be effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the Security;

-----

###### • be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by Liens on property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property or assets so securing such Indebtedness;

 • be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including interest payables, trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries;

 • mature on 30 October 2025; and

 • be initially represented by one or more Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances can be represented by Individual Note Certificates.

 General

 The Issuer is a holding company without operations, and, therefore, the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including interest payables, trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer to receive assets of a Subsidiary upon such Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganisation (and the consequent right of the Holders of the Additional Notes to participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognised as a creditor of the relevant Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinate in right of payment to any security in the assets of the Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Group’s Debt Profile, Structure and the Notes—The Notes are Subordinated to liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries”.

 As of 30 June 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Additional Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom as discussed in “Use of Proceeds”: (i) the Issuer would have had €841 million of total borrowings (including the Notes) and (ii) the Issuer’s Subsidiaries would have had €5,828 million of total liabilities (including interest payables, trade payables, hedging and retirement obligations, but excluding intercompany liabilities), all of which would have been structurally senior to the Notes.

 As at the Additional Notes Issue Date, no Issuer’s Subsidiary will be an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries”, the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Conditions.

 Subsequent Additional Notes

 Subject to the limitations set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer may incur additional Indebtedness. At the Issuer’s option, this additional Indebtedness may consist of subsequent additional Notes (“Subsequent Additional Notes”) issued in one or more transactions, which have substantially identical terms as the Original Notes issued on the Original Notes Issue Date and the Additional Notes issued on the Additional Notes Issue Date; provided that Subsequent Additional Notes may not bear the same common code or other security identification number as the Original Notes issued on the Original Notes Issue Date, unless such Subsequent Additional Notes are fungible with the outstanding Original Notes issued on the Original Notes Issue Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Holders of Subsequent Additional Notes would have the right to vote together with holders of the Original Notes and the Holders of the Additional Notes as one class under the Conditions.

 Principal, Maturity and Interest

 The Issuer will initially issue €150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes, but may issue an unlimited principal amount of Subsequent Additional Notes under the Trust Deed, subject to the conditions to the issuance of Additional Notes set forth in the Trust Deed.

 The Issuer will issue the Additional Notes in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on 30 October 2025. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.500% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and 30 December of each year, commencing on 30 December 2021. Payments will be made to the persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on 30 June and 30 December, respectively, immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Additional Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid on the Additional

 66


-----

###### Notes, from and including 30 June 2021. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

 Payments on the Additional Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent

 The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) in the City of London. The initial sole Paying Agent is The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and transfer agents (each, a “Transfer Agent”). The current Registrar and the current Transfer Agent are The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch. The Issuer may, however, change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent without consent of, and prior notice to, the Holders. For so long as the Notes are listed, and admitted for trading, on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in accordance with the requirements of such rules.

 The Issuer will pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on, Additional Notes in global form deposited with or on behalf of the Common Depositary and registered in the name of the nominee for the Common Depositary in immediately available funds to the Paying Agent for further payment to Holders. Investors in the Additional Notes will receive payments of such amounts subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”. Interest on Additional Notes held as Individual Note Certificates, if any, will be payable to a Holder by wire transfer in immediately available funds to that Holder’s account. All other payments on Additional Notes held as Individual Note Certificates will be made at the office or agency of a Paying Agent and Registrar unless the Issuer elects to make payments.

 Investors in the Additional Notes will be subject to foreign exchange risks as to payments of any such amounts that may have important economic and tax consequences to them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Group’s Debt Profile, Structure and the Additional Notes—Prospective investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Additional Notes”.

 Transfer and Exchange

 The Additional Notes will initially be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons (the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will, on the Additional Notes Issue Date, be deposited with, and registered in the name of, the nominee of the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

 Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors” and the Agency Agreement. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

 If Individual Note Certificates are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or the Conditions. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Individual Note Certificates issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Trust Deed or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to the restrictions on transfer summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.

 Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Additional Notes issued as Individual Note Certificates may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Conditions will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things,

 (a) furnish (i) appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, (ii) information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, and (iii) certain certificates and opinions, and

 (b) pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange.

 67


-----

###### Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to Holders, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Individual Note Certificates:

 (i) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Individual Note Certificates;

 (ii) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Individual Note Certificates to be redeemed in part;

 (iii) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to such Individual Note Certificates; or

 (iv) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

 The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of an Additional Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

 Security

 General

 The obligations of the Issuer under the Additional Notes will be, secured by the first and/or second ranking (a) pledges over all of the shares of Capital Stock of each Pledged Subsidiary and (b) charge over the Debt Service Reserve Account (collectively, the “Security”), in each case, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. As at the Additional Notes Issue Date, the Pledged Subsidiaries are Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Limited.

 On or about (i) the Original Notes Issue Date, the Issuer and the Security Trustee entered into an English law security agreement and (ii) the Additional Notes Issue Date, the Issuer and the Security Trustee will enter into a French law second ranking security agreement on the Additional Notes Issue Date (together, the “Pledge Agreements”) evidencing the liens referred to in (a) and (b) above.

 The Security also secures (or will secure, as applicable) on a first-priority basis obligations outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of the Issuer’s future Indebtedness (including certain Hedging Obligations) and other obligations permitted under the Conditions to be so secured, provided that an authorised representative of the holders of such Indebtedness shall have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement. However, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of any collection, sale, disposition or other realisation of Security received in connection with the exercise of remedies (including distributions of cash, securities or other property on account of the value of the Security in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganisation or similar proceedings) will be applied first to repay the Indebtedness and other obligations (including any post-petition interest with respect thereto) permitted to be incurred under clauses (a) and (e) of paragraph 2 of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness”, including any obligations incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other permitted super senior revolving credit facilities and certain Hedging Obligations (the “Super Senior Liabilities” and, together with the Pari Passu Liabilities, the “Priority Creditor Liabilities”), before any Holder receives any proceeds.

 So long as no Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and conditions, the Issuer will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Security and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Security.

 Administration of Security

 The Security Documents and the Security will be administered by the Security Trustee for the benefit of, among others, the Security Trustee, the Trustee, Holders of the Additional Notes and other secured creditors who have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting an Additional Note, each Holder of the Additional Notes will be deemed to have:

 • irrevocably appointed the Security Trustee to act as security trustee under the Security Documents; and

 68


-----

###### • irrevocably authorised the Security Trustee to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Security Documents or other documents to which it is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Trustee on its behalf.

 Application of Proceeds from the Security

 Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds realised by the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the trustees or agents for any other series of Pari Passu Liabilities or Super Senior Liabilities (including obligations outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations) from realisation or enforcement of the Security will be applied:

 • first, to the payment of all sums owed to the Security Trustee, the Trustee and any other creditor representative (in their respective capacities as such);

 • second, to the payment in full of all costs and expenses incurred by creditors for the Priority Creditor Liabilities in connection with such realisation or enforcement;

 • third, to the payment in full of all remaining Super Senior Liabilities (including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations), the amounts so applied to be distributed on a pari passu basis to each series of Super Senior Liabilities for distribution in accordance with the applicable agreements or documents governing the Super Senior Liabilities;

 • fourth, to the payment in full of all remaining Pari Passu Liabilities, the amounts so applied to be distributed on a pari passu basis to each series of Pari Passu Liabilities for distribution in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements or documents governing the Pari Passu Liabilities;

 • fifth, to the payment of any holder and their creditor representative in respect of Subordinated High Yield Note Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

 • sixth, to the payment of any other creditor to whom the Security Trustee is obliged to pay in priority to the Issuer; and

 • seventh, to the Issuer.

 If the net proceeds of any of the Security were not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Additional Notes, the Holders of the Additional Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Security) would have only an unsecured claim against the remaining assets of the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Debt Profile Structure and the Additional Notes—The Proceeds from the enforcement of the Security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Additional Notes”.

 Release of Security

 The Liens on the Security will be released with respect to the Notes:

 (1) in whole, upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Trust Deed and the Notes (other than contingent obligations that may arise in the future for indemnities or otherwise);

 (2) in part, as to any property constituting Security that is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Issuer in a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” (to the extent of the interest sold or disposed of); provided that if required to effect a transaction resulting in any such release, it may occur contemporaneously with or prior to such transaction if the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee setting forth in reasonable detail such requirement;

 (3) in whole or in part, with the consent of Holders of the requisite percentage of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions;

 (4) in whole, upon satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as provided under “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

 (5) if, at any time the Security Trustee enforces or otherwise exercises remedies against any Security in accordance with paragraph 12 of the Intercreditor Agreement;

 69


-----

###### (6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the Conditions, the release of the property and assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;

 (7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation; or

 (8) otherwise as permitted in accordance with the Conditions, the Trust Deed, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents.

 Upon release of the Security, but subject to the rights of any holder of Priority Creditor Liabilities or other Pari Passu Liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement, Priority Debt Document (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or Security Document, the Security Trustee shall (at the Issuer’s expense) take such actions as reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to reconvey to the Issuer the released Security.

 Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Trustee without the consent of the Holders of the Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by the Trustee to effect such release).

 Sufficiency of Security

 The fair market value of the Security is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of the Issuer’s Group industry, the ability to sell the Security in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Security would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Security at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Security may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Security can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, the ability of the Holders to realise upon any of the Security may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations, as described below.

 In addition, distribution of the proceeds from the Security may be subject to the rights of any holder of Pari Passu Liabilities or Super Senior Liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Additional Amounts

 All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any successor thereto (each, a “Payor”) under, or with respect to, the Notes will be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including penalties, interest and other liabilities related thereto) (collectively, “Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or the interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed, levied, collected or assessed by or on behalf of (1) France or the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein, respectively, having power to tax, (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes is made on behalf of the Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax or (3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organised, resident or deemed to be doing business, or any political or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes, including payments of principal, premium, if any, redemption price or interest, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts paid by the Payor or its agent in respect of such payments to each Holder or beneficial owner, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been paid to each Holder or beneficial owner in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

 (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being or having been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein, but excluding any connection arising merely from the receipt of such payment or the acquisition or ownership of the Notes or enforcement of rights thereunder);

 (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property or similar tax, including excise taxes imposed on subsequent transfers of the Notes;

 70


-----

###### (3) any Taxes which are imposed, payable or due because the Notes are held in the form of Individual Note Certificates and are presented (where presentation is required) for payment more than 30 days after the date such payment was due and payable or was first provided for, whichever is later, except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been imposed had the Holder presented its Individual Note Certificates for payment on the last day of such 30-day period;

 (4) any Taxes which are imposed on, or with respect to, or withheld or deducted from, a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner of Notes, which would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

 (5) any Taxes which are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner of a Note to comply, at the Issuer’s written request, with certification, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection of the Holder or such beneficial owner with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or to make, at the Issuer’s written request, any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled if (a) such compliance, making a claim or filing for exemption is required or imposed by a statute, treaty or regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes, and (b) the Payor has given the Holder at least 30 days’ notice that the Holder or beneficial owner will be required to comply with such certification, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement, or make such claim or filing for exemption;

 (6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Notes;

 (7) any withholding or deduction that is imposed in connection with Sections 1471-1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”), any intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction implementing, or relating to, FATCA or any law, regulation or official guidance enacted or issued in any jurisdiction with respect thereto;

 (8) any payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest on such Note to any Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such a partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Note directly;

 (9) any payment made to an account opened in the name of, or for the benefit of, any Holder in a financial institution situated in a non-cooperative state or territory (Etat ou territoire non-coopératif) as set out in the list referred to in article 238-0 A of the French Code général des impôts, as such list may be amended from time to time; or

 (10) any combination of the above.

 The Payor will (1) make any required withholding or deduction and (2) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the applicable taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts or other available documentation evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and upon request will provide any such certified copies or other documentation obtained to the Paying Agent.

 If the Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes, the Payor will deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the relevant payment date, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders of the Notes on the payment date. Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon by the Paying Agent without further enquiry until receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters.

 The foregoing obligations will survive any termination or discharge of the Trust Deed and will apply mutatis mutandis to any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction with respect to any successor Person to a Payor.

 Whenever in the Trust Deed, the Conditions or in this section entitled “Description of Additional Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, (1) the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, (2) redemption prices in connection with the redemption of the Notes or (3) any other amount payable under or with respect to the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

###### Optional Redemption

 Optional Redemption

 Prior to 30 October 2022, the Issuer will have the right, at its option, to redeem Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as at, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

 At any time, or from time to time, after 30 October 2022, the Issuer may redeem Notes, at its option, in whole or in part, at the following redemption prices, expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on 30 October of any year set forth below:

**Year** **Percentage**
###### 2022 ..................................................................................................................................................................... 101.750% 2023 ..................................................................................................................................................................... 100.875% 2024 and thereafter .............................................................................................................................................. 100.000%

 Optional Redemption upon Equity Event

 At any time, or from time to time, on or prior to 30 October 2022, the Issuer may, at its option, use the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Events to redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Subsequent Additional Notes) at a redemption price in cash equal to 103.500% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that (i) at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Subsequent Additional Notes) must remain outstanding immediately after giving effect to each such redemption (excluding the Notes held by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries) and (ii) such redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the closing of the relevant Equity Event.

 Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes

 If, as a result of any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or any rulings, rules or regulations thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or any amendment to or change in an official interpretation or application of such laws, rulings, rules or regulations (including by virtue of a judgment, order by a court or change in published administrative practice), which amendment or change becomes announced and effective on or after the date of the Offering Memorandum (or in the case where a jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Offering Memorandum, such later date), the relevant Payor would be obligated, after taking all reasonable measures to avoid this requirement, to pay Additional Amounts (provided that the relevant Payor shall not be required to take any measures that, in its reasonable determination, would result in the imposition on it of any material legal or regulatory burden or the incurrence by it of any material costs, or would otherwise result in any material adverse consequences), then, at the Issuer’s option, all, but not less than all, of the Notes may be redeemed at any time on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Amounts due thereon up to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that (1) no notice of redemption for tax reasons may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the relevant Payor would be obligated to pay these Additional Amounts if a payment on the Notes were then due, and (2) at the time such notice of redemption is given such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect.

 This notice, once delivered by the Issuer to the Holders, will be irrevocable subject to any conditions precedent set forth in such notice.

 Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this provision, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

 • an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect the redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to redeem have occurred; and

 72


-----

###### • an Opinion of Counsel from counsel in the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (which may be the Issuer’s counsel) stating that no later than the next succeeding date on which any amount is to be paid, the relevant Payor has or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of such amendment or change.

 The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on any Officer’s Certificate and/or Opinion of Counsel delivered to it pursuant to the provisions of the above paragraph without further enquiry or liability, following which such documents, shall become binding on the Trustee and the Holders.

 Optional Redemption Procedures

 If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Registrar will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, subject to the following sentence (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”, in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements. No Notes of a principal amount of €100,000 or less may be redeemed in part and Notes of a principal amount in excess of €100,000 may be redeemed in part in multiples of €1,000 only.

 Notice of any optional redemption will be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid or otherwise given in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, at least ten, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed (with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent). For so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will also cause notices of redemption to be published as described under “—Notices” below. If the Notes are to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof (if any) will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note (or appropriate adjustments to the amount and beneficial interests in the Global Note will be made, as appropriate).

 The Issuer will pay the redemption price for the Notes together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption as long as the Issuer has deposited with the Paying Agent funds in satisfaction of the applicable redemption price pursuant to the Conditions.

 In connection with any redemption of the Notes (including with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Event), any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s sole and absolute discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including any related Equity Event. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s sole and absolute discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. If any such redemption is delayed or terminated, the Issuer will provide prompt written notice of such delay or termination to the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and the Holders.

 In the event that Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw their Notes in a Change of Control Offer, Asset Sale Offer or other tender offer and the Issuer (or a third party making the offer as described above) purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and, accordingly, the Issuer or third party offeror, as applicable, will have the right, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice with delivery electronically or by first class mail, postage prepaid, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the registered address of such Holder (or otherwise given in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream), to redeem (in the case of the Issuer) or purchase (in the case of a third party offeror) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price or purchase price, as the case may be, equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such offer (which may be less than par) plus, to the extent not included in such price, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

 Mandatory Redemption; Open Market Purchases

 Mandatory Redemption upon the Fixed Link Sale

 If a Fixed Link Sale is consummated in accordance with the covenant under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Fixed Link Sale”, then the Issuer shall, upon the receipt of the cash proceeds of such Fixed Link Sale, redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and

 73


-----

###### unpaid interest and any Additional Amounts due thereon up to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), provided that any Net Cash Proceeds of such Fixed Link Sale shall be first applied by the Group to repay any principal outstanding, pay any interest accrued but unpaid and pay any additional amounts due under the Fixed Link Debt in accordance with its terms.

 Mandatory Redemption Procedures

 Notice of any mandatory redemption will be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid or otherwise given in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, at least ten, but not more than 60 days (or longer than 60 days in the case of a discharge), before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes (with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent).

 For so long as the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will also cause such notice of mandatory redemption to be published as described under “—Notices” below. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes as long as the Issuer has deposited with the Paying Agent funds in satisfaction of the applicable redemption price pursuant to the Conditions.

 Other than as discussed in this “—Mandatory Redemption; Open Market Purchases”, the Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”.

 Open Market Purchases

 The Issuer and/or any of its Subsidiaries may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offers, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Conditions.

 Change of Control

 Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder will have the right to require that the Issuer purchase all or a portion (in integral multiples of €1,000; provided that the remaining principal amount of such Holder’s Note will not be less than €100,000) of the Holder’s Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”).

 Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurred, the Issuer must send, electronically or by first-class mail or otherwise in accordance with the Conditions and applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent, offering to purchase the Notes as described above (a “Change of Control Offer”). The Change of Control Offer shall state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than ten days nor later than 60 days from the date the notice is mailed, except as may be required by law, and in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below (the “Change of Control Payment Date”). If and for so long as the Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date, on the official website of such exchange.

 On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

 (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

 (2) deposit with the Paying Agent funds in an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not withdrawn; and

 (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Registrar the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer.

 74


-----

###### If only a portion of a Note is purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, a new Note in a principal amount equal to the portion thereof not purchased will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note (or appropriate adjustments to the amount and beneficial interests in the Global Note will be made, as appropriate); provided that the remaining principal amount of such Holder’s Note will not be less than €100,000 and will be in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

 The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in a manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Conditions applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption for all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Conditions as described under the captions “—Optional Redemption” and “— Mandatory Redemption; Open Market Purchases”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, or conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. If a Change of Control Offer is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event, such Change of Control Offer shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s sole and absolute discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any such condition shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any such condition shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, provided that the purchase date shall be no earlier than 15 days from the date notice is mailed.

 The agreements governing the Issuer’s other Indebtedness contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event, and such agreements contain or may contain provisions prohibiting repurchases of, or other prepayments in respect of, other Indebtedness, including the Notes, following a Change of Control Triggering Event. The exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. In the event a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Conditions which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Group’s Debt Profile, Structure and the Notes—The Group may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control”.

 If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, the Issuer may not have available funds sufficient to make the Change of Control Payment for all Notes that might be delivered by Holders seeking to accept a Change of Control Offer. In the event the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer expects that it would seek third-party financing to the extent it does not have available funds to meet its purchase obligations. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain necessary financing.

 The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Conditions or the Trust Deed are applicable. Holders will not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation, leveraged buyout or similar transaction which is not a Change of Control.

 The Issuer will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the “Change of Control” provisions of the Conditions, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Notes or the Trust Deed by doing so. If it would be unlawful in any jurisdiction to make a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will not be obligated to make such offer in such jurisdiction and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Notes or the Trust Deed by doing so.

 The obligation of the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified at any time prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event with the written consent of Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

 (iii) if the Issuer is the obligee under any such intercompany Indebtedness, then such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the Notes;

 (h) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of bankers’ acceptances, workers’ compensation claims, bid, surety or appeal bonds, payment obligations in connection with insurance premiums or similar obligations, security deposits and bank overdrafts (and letters of credit in connection with, in lieu of or in respect of each of the foregoing);

 3. The Issuer will not Incur any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior Lien basis.

 4. For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of, any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with this covenant:

 (a) the outstanding principal amount of any item of Indebtedness will be counted only once (without duplication for guarantees or otherwise);

 (b) in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Indebtedness described in clauses (a) through (s) of paragraph 2 of this covenant or is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph 1 of this covenant, the Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, divide and classify (or at any time reclassify) such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant; and

 (c) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS. Accrual of interest, the accretion or amortisation of original issue discount, the payment of regularly scheduled interest in the form of additional Indebtedness of the same instrument or the payment of regularly scheduled dividends on Disqualified Capital Stock in the form of additional Disqualified Capital Stock with the same terms will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant; provided that any such outstanding additional Indebtedness or Disqualified Capital Stock paid in respect of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any provision of paragraph 2 of this covenant will be counted as Indebtedness outstanding thereunder for purposes of any future Incurrence under such provision.

 Limitation on Restricted Payments

 The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions (each, a “Restricted Payment”):

 (a) declare, make or pay any dividend, charge, fee or other distribution (or interest on any unpaid dividend, charge fee or other distribution) (whether in cash or in kind) on or in respect of its share capital (or any class of its share capital), other than:

 • dividends or distributions payable in Qualified Capital Stock of the Issuer;

 • dividends, distributions, returns of capital or other payments payable to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

 • dividends, distributions or returns of capital made on at least a pro rata basis to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other holders of Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary, on the other hand (or on a less than pro rata basis to any minority holder);

 (b) repay or distribute any share premium reserve, in each case, with respect to the Issuer;

 (c) redeem, repurchase, defease, retire or repay any of the Issuer’s share capital or resolve to do so, other that in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Capital Stock); or

 78


-----

###### Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, this covenant shall not prohibit:

 1. any Restricted Payment, provided that:

 (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of, and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing after giving effect to such Restricted Payment;

 (ii) as at the Testing Date immediately preceding the date on which the Restricted Payment is proposed to be made, the Debt Service Cover Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a look back rolling last twelve month basis was equal to, or in excess of, 1.25 to 1.0; and

 (iii) on the date on which the Restricted Payment is proposed to be made, the Debt Service Reserve Account contains at least the Minimum DSRA Amount;

 3. any distribution in any form whatsoever of the proceeds of any Europorte Sale.

 The amount of any Restricted Payments not in cash will be the Fair Market Value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the property, assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment.

 Limitation on Asset Sales

 The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

 (a) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (measured as at the date of the definitive agreement with respect to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of, and

 (b) at least 75% of the consideration received for the assets sold by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the Asset Sale shall be in the form of (1) cash or Cash Equivalents, (2) assets (other than current assets as determined in accordance with IFRS or Capital Stock) to be used by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Business, (3) Capital Stock in a Person engaged primarily in a Permitted Business that will become a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale or (4) a combination of cash, Cash Equivalents and such assets.

 The Issuer and one or more Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, may apply within 365 days of any Asset Sale an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from any such Asset Sale to:

 (a) repay any Priority Credit Liabilities of the Issuer or any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary for borrowed money (including any such Indebtedness represented by bonds, notes, debentures or other similar instruments) or constituting a Capitalised Lease Obligation (in each case, including any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof); or

 (b) purchase:

 (i) assets (other than current assets as determined in accordance with IFRS or Capital Stock) to be used by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Business; or

 (ii) Capital Stock of a Person engaged in a Permitted Business that will become, upon purchase, a Restricted Subsidiary; from a Person other than the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

 (c) make Capital Expenditures; or

 (d) repurchase, prepay, redeem or repay (1) Pari Passu Liabilities; provided that a pro rata portion of such amount of cash is at the Issuer’s option (i) applied to redeem Notes as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption” or purchase the Notes through open market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or (ii) offered to purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase, which offer will constitute an application of Net Cash Proceeds

 79


-----

###### pursuant to this paragraph to the extent of the amount of the offer, whether or not any Notes are tendered; or (2) any CLEF Financing,

 provided that if during such 365-day period the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into a definitive binding agreement committing it to apply such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with the requirements of clauses (b) or (c) after such 365-day period, such 365-day period will be extended with respect to the amount of Net Cash Proceeds so committed, for a period not to exceed 180 days until such Net Cash Proceeds are required to be applied in accordance with such agreement (or, if earlier, until termination of such agreement).

 Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Conditions and the Trust Deed.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Asset Sale is the result of an involuntary expropriation, nationalisation, taking or similar action by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority, such Asset Sale need not comply with clauses (a) and (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant. In addition, the proceeds of any such Asset Sale shall not be deemed to have been received (and the 365-day period in which to apply any Net Cash Proceeds shall not begin to run) until the proceeds to be paid by or on behalf of the Governmental Authority have been paid in cash to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary making such Asset Sale and if any litigation, arbitration or other action is brought contesting the validity of or any other matter relating to any such expropriation, nationalisation, taking or other similar action, including the amount of the compensation to be paid in respect thereof, until such litigation, arbitration or other action is finally settled or a final judgment or award has been entered and any such judgment or award has been collected in full.

 For the purpose of this covenant and for no other purpose, the following are deemed to be Cash Equivalents:

 (a) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee to the extent, and in the amount, that they are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days of the closing of the Asset Sale;

 (b) the amount (without duplication) of liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s, or such Restricted Subsidiary’s, most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the notes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are expressly assumed by the transferee (or a third party on behalf of the transferee) of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) and for which the Issuer and all Subsidiaries have been released by all creditors;

 (c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries), to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;

 (d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Original Notes Issue Date from persons that are not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

 (e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (e) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) €90.0 million and (y) 16.8% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

 To the extent there are any remaining Net Cash Proceeds (“Excess Proceeds”) that have not been applied as described in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the second paragraph of this covenant within 365 days after the Asset Sale (or such longer period as permitted under the second paragraph of this covenant), the Issuer will make an offer to purchase Notes (an “Asset Sale Offer”), at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Asset Sale Offer Amount”). The Issuer will purchase pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer from all tendering Holders on a pro rata basis (subject to maintaining the authorised denominations for the Notes), and, at the Issuer’s option, on a pro rata basis with the Holders of any other Senior Indebtedness with similar provisions requiring the Issuer to offer to purchase the other Senior Indebtedness with the

 80


-----

###### proceeds of Asset Sales, that principal amount (or accreted value in the case of Indebtedness issued with original issue discount) of Notes and the other Senior Indebtedness to be purchased equal to such Excess Proceeds. The Issuer may satisfy its obligations under this covenant with respect to the Excess Proceeds of an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 365-day (or longer, if applicable) period.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may defer an Asset Sale Offer until there is an aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds from one or more Asset Sales in excess of €50.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies). At that time, the amount of Excess Proceeds in excess of €50.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies) will be applied as required pursuant to this covenant.

 Each notice of an Asset Sale Offer will be provided to the Holders within 30 days following such 365[th] day (or such later date as permitted under this covenant), with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent offering to purchase Notes as described above. Each notice of an Asset Sale Offer will state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date the notice is mailed or otherwise given in accordance with the Conditions, other than as may be required by law (the “Asset Sale Offer Payment Date”). Upon receiving notice of an Asset Sale Offer, Holders may elect to tender their Notes in whole or in part in integral multiples of €1,000 in exchange for cash; provided that the principal amount of such tendering Holder’s Note shall not be less than €100,000.

 On the Asset Sale Offer Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

 (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer;

 (2) deposit with the Paying Agent funds in an amount equal to the Asset Sale Offer Amount in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not withdrawn; and

 (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Registrar Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer.

 To the extent Holders of Notes and holders of other Senior Indebtedness, if any, which are the subject of an Asset Sale Offer properly tender and do not withdraw Notes or the other Senior Indebtedness in an aggregate amount exceeding the amount of the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer will purchase Notes and the other Senior Indebtedness on a pro rata basis (based on amounts tendered and subject to maintaining the authorised denominations for the Notes) as set forth above. If only a portion of a Note is purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer, a new Note in a principal amount equal to the portion thereof not purchased will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note (or appropriate adjustments to the amount and beneficial interests in the Global Note will be made, as appropriate).

 The Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the “Asset Sale” provisions in the Conditions, the Issuer will comply with these laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the “Asset Sale” provisions in the Conditions by doing so. If it would be unlawful in any jurisdiction to make an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer will not be obligated to make such offer in such jurisdiction and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Notes and the Trust Deed by doing so.

 The agreements governing the Issuer’s other Indebtedness contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute an Asset Sale and including repurchases of, or other prepayments in respect of, the Notes. The exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Conditions which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources.

 To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Senior Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is lower than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Conditions. Upon completion of an Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. Accordingly, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other Indebtedness

 81


-----

###### tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any Excess Proceeds in any manner not otherwise prohibited by the Conditions or the Trust Deed.

 Limitation on Fixed Link Sale

 The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate any Fixed Link Sale, unless required by law or any Governmental Authority.

 If a Fixed Link Sale is consummated in accordance with the requirements of law or any Governmental Authority, the Net Cash Proceeds of such Fixed Link Sale shall be applied by the Issuer to first, repay any principal, and any other amounts, outstanding under any Fixed Link Debt in accordance with its terms and, second, in accordance with “Mandatory Redemption; Open Market Purchases Mandatory—Redemption upon the Fixed Link Sale”.

 Limitation on Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries

 The Issuer may designate after the Original Notes Issue Date any Subsidiary of the Issuer as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” under the Conditions (a “Designation”) only if:

 (1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of, and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing after giving effect to, such Designation;

 (2) immediately after giving effect to such Designation, the Issuer will be able to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph 1 of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness”; and

 (3) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of Designation (assuming the effectiveness of such Designation and treating such Designation as an Investment at the time of Designation) as a Restricted Payment pursuant to “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in an amount equal to the amount of the Issuer’s Investment in such Subsidiary on such date (as determined in accordance with the second paragraph of the definition of “Investment”).

 The Issuer may revoke any Designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (a “Revocation”) only if:

 (1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of, and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, after giving effect to such Revocation;

 (2) all Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary outstanding immediately following such Revocation would, if Incurred at such time, be permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Conditions; and

 (3) all Liens upon the property or assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary existing immediately following such Revocation would, if Incurred at such time, be permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Conditions.

 In addition, if an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that Designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness owed to such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such Designation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness”, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such Designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period.

 The Designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to include the Designation of all of the Subsidiaries of such Subsidiary. The Designation of any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary may be revoked at any time. All Designations and Revocations must be evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, delivered to the Trustee (who shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate without further enquiry or liability) certifying compliance with the preceding provisions.

 Limitation on Liens

 The Issuer will not Incur any Liens of any kind against or upon any of its properties or assets whether owned on the Original Notes Issue Date or acquired after the Original Notes Issue Date, or any proceeds therefrom, to secure any Indebtedness, unless (a) in the case of a Lien on assets other than the Security, (i) such Lien is a Permitted Lien or (ii) contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Notes and all other amounts due under the Conditions, in each case, equally and ratably with such Indebtedness or other obligation (or, in the event that such Indebtedness is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, as the case may be, senior in priority to such Indebtedness

 82


-----

###### or other obligation) with a Lien on the same properties and assets securing such Indebtedness or other obligation for so long as such Indebtedness or other obligation is secured by such Lien; or (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Security, such Lien is a Permitted Security Lien.

 Limitation on Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets

 The Issuer will not, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving or continuing Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer (determined on a consolidated basis for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), to any Person unless:

 (a) either:

 (i) the Issuer shall be the surviving or continuing corporation; or

 (ii) the Person (if other than the Issuer) formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition the properties and assets of the Issuer and of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries substantially as an entirety (the “Surviving Entity”):

 (A) shall be an entity organised or incorporated, as applicable, and validly existing under the laws of (i) France; (ii) England and Wales or (iii) any other country which is a member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, and, if such entity is not a corporation, there shall be a co-obligor of the Notes that is a corporation organised or existing under any such laws; and

 (B) shall expressly assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Trust Deed and the Security Documents, pursuant to a supplemental trust deed and any other required security documents;

 (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the assumption contemplated by item (ii)(B) of clause (a) above (including giving effect on a pro forma basis to any Indebtedness, including any Acquired Indebtedness, Incurred or anticipated to be Incurred in connection with or in respect of such transaction), either (x) the Issuer or such Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will be able to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph 1 of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” or (y) the Total Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be equal to or less and the Debt Service Cover Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be equal to or greater than immediately prior to such transaction;

 (c) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the assumption contemplated by item (ii)(B) of clause (a) above (including, without limitation, giving effect on a pro forma basis to any Indebtedness, including any Acquired Indebtedness, Incurred or anticipated to be Incurred and any Lien granted in connection with or in respect of the transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing; and

 (d) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such transaction and such supplemental trust deed, if any, comply with the Trust Deed.

 The Trust Deed contains provisions permitting the Trustee (if it is satisfied that to do so would not be materially prejudicial to the interests of Holders) to agree, if requested by the Issuer and subject to such amendment of the Trust Deed, but without the consent of Holders, to the substitution of any other company in place of the Issuer, or of any previous substituted company, as principal debtor under the Trust Deed and the Additional Notes, subject to the Additional Notes remaining subject to security that is equivalent or substantially equivalent to the Security, as provided in this “Description of Additional Notes”.

 Upon any consolidation, combination or merger or any transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer in accordance with this covenant, in which the Issuer is not the continuing Person, the Surviving Entity formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer is merged or to which such conveyance, lease or transfer is made will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Trust Deed and the Notes, with the same effect as if such Surviving Entity had been named as such. For the avoidance of doubt, compliance with this covenant will not affect the obligations of the Issuer (including a Surviving Entity, if applicable) under “—Change of Control”, if applicable.

 83


-----

###### Conduct of Business

 The Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not engage in any business other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 Maintenance of Listing

 The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, for so long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of the Notes on another recognised listing exchange for high yield issuers.

 Debt Service Reserve Account

 The Issuer has opened an account (the “Debt Service Reserve Account”) with BNP Paribas in London and, on or before the Original Notes Issue Date, has procured:

 (a) an amount of cash is transferred to the Debt Service Reserve Account, which is an amount not less than the Minimum DSRA Amount;

 (b) withdrawals from the Debt Service Reserve Account are only used for the purpose of paying fees and interest on the Secured Obligations as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (including any Secured Obligations denominated in a currency other than euro), after using all other amounts available to the Issuer; and

 (c) first ranking security is granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the Notes over the Debt Service Reserve Account in a form acceptable to the Security Trustee, acting reasonably in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Further Assurances

 Subject to the limitations set forth in the Security Documents, the Conditions provide that the Issuer will execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further action that may be required under applicable law, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests and Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Security.

 Impairment of Security Interest in Security

 The Issuer shall not take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action that would have the result of materially impairing any security interest with respect to the Security (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Liens as described under “—Limitation on Liens” shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair any security interest with respect to the Security) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not grant to any Person other than the Security Trustee, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Security, except that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any of the Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring Liens permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”, (ii) the Issuer may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Document for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganisation, (iii) the Security may be discharged and released in accordance with the Conditions, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv)(a) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (b) the security interests in the Security may be amended in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect, in each case, in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (iv)(b) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iv)(b) above, as applicable, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Security Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Security Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any relevant action with respect to Security Documents to which the Issuer is party as a security grantor, confirming the solvency of the Issuer), after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) an Officer’s Certificate, in a form satisfactory to the Security Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such security interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,

 84


-----

###### extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Security Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the applicable Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall, subject to the terms of the Trust Deed and the Security Document, consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions from any Holder.

 Reports to Holders

 So long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders of the Notes and to the Trustee:

 1. within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year (beginning, for Holders of the Additional Notes, with the fiscal year ending 31 December 2021), annual reports, which shall contain the following information with a level of detail that is substantially comparable to Annex A of the Offering Memorandum:

 (i) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as at the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;

 (ii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies;

 (iii) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material new contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments (unless such contractual arrangements were described in a previous annual or semi-annual report, in which case the Issuer need to describe only any material changes); and

 (iv) material risk factors relating to the business of the Issuer and material recent developments;

 2. within 90 days following the end of each semi-annual period in each fiscal year of the Issuer (beginning, for Holders of the Additional Notes, with the semi-annual period ending on 30 June 2022), semi-annual reports, which shall contain the following information with a level of detail that is substantially comparable to Annex B of the Offering Memorandum:

 (i) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of such period and unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flow of the Issuer for the semi-annual period ending on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet date and the comparable prior year period, together with condensed footnote disclosure;

 (ii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of changes in material commitments and contingencies and changes in critical accounting policies; and

 (iii) material recent developments; and

 3. promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition, restructuring of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, any change in the Chief Executive Officer or Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer or change in auditors or any other material event that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

 The Issuer will provide to the Trustee such other information that it is required to make publicly available under the requirements of the Relevant Exchange as a result of having its ordinary shares admitted for trading on any such exchange. Notwithstanding clauses (1) through (3) of the preceding paragraph of this “Reports to Holders” covenant, upon the Issuer complying with the public reporting requirements (including applicable timing requirements) of the Relevant Exchange (regardless of whether the Issuer’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on such exchange), provided that

 85


-----

###### such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the Relevant Exchange, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in clauses (1) through (3) of the preceding paragraph of this “Reports to Holders” covenant.

 If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted Subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, would otherwise have been a Significant Subsidiary, then the annual and semi-annual financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports to Holders” covenant shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, as determined in good faith by senior management of the Issuer of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

 All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the Conditions) shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect, including, to the extent adopted at such time, the application of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor standard thereto, on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in the first, second and third paragraphs above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum.

 So long as any Notes remain outstanding, no later than 20 Business Days after the delivery of the annual and semi-annual reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports to Holders” covenant, the Issuer shall hold a live conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period for the benefit of Holders or prospective holders of Notes (or provide Holders of the Notes with access to any public conference call, investor presentation, webcast or other event, the primary purpose of which is to discuss such reports and the results of operations); provided that no more than one conference call will be required in relation to any annual and semi-annual period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such call or presentation shall be required if the Group does not conduct such a call or presentation in connection with the listing of its Capital Stock on any Relevant Exchange.

 Covenant Fall Away

 If (i) a Rating Release Event has occurred and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then, beginning on that day, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be released from their respective obligations under the provisions of this “Description of Additional Notes” described under the following covenants “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness”, “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, “—Limitation on Asset Sales”, “— Limitation on Liens”, “—Limitation on Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets”, and “—Conduct of Business” and such provisions shall be terminated and permanently cease to have effect with respect to the Notes. The Issuer shall promptly give notice to the Trustee and provide the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate stating that the conditions set forth in this paragraph have been satisfied; provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the termination of the covenants described under this “Covenants Fall Away” caption to be effective.

 Events of Default

 The following are “Events of Default”:

 1. default in the payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes, including the failure to make a required payment to purchase the Notes tendered pursuant to an optional redemption, Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer;

 2. default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts on the Notes;

 3. the failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any other covenant or agreement contained in the Conditions or the Trust Deed for 60 days or more after written notice to the Issuer from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes (in the case of a notice by the Holders, with a copy to the Trustee);

 4. default by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which shall not have been cured or waived under any Indebtedness (including Indebtedness under any Credit Facility) which:

 86


-----

###### (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default; or

 (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity;

 provided that (i) the principal or accreted amount of Indebtedness covered by clauses (a) or (b) above at the relevant time, exceeds (x) in the case of the Issuer, €50.0 million individually or in the aggregate (or the equivalent in other currencies) or (x) in the case of Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, €100.0 million individually or in the aggregate (or the equivalent in other currencies) or (ii) such Indebtedness is the Fixed Link Debt, and provided further that nothing in clauses (a) or (b) above shall constitute an Event of Default in respect of any Indebtedness during such time as a “conciliation process” is in progress in relation to the relevant member of Issuer’s Group under applicable French law;

 5. failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay one or more final judgments against any of them, aggregating (i) in the case of the Issuer, €50.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies) or more or (ii) in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, € 100.0 million (or the equivalent in other currencies) or more, which judgment(s), in each case, are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days or more;

 6. (i) any security interest created by the Security Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (except as permitted by the terms of the Conditions or the Security Documents) with respect to Security having a Fair Market Value in excess of (i) €50.0 million, in the case of Security held by the Issuer or (ii) €100.0 million, in the case of Security held by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, or an assertion by the Issuer that any Security having a Fair Market Value in excess of (i) €50.0 million, in the case of Security held by the Issuer or (ii) €100.0 million, in the case of Security held by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer is not subject to a valid, perfected security interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Conditions or the Security Documents); (ii) the repudiation by the Issuer of any of its material obligations under the Security Documents; or (iii) any material representation or warranty made by the Issuer in any Security Document proves to have been false or misleading in any material respect as at the time made, and the fact, event or circumstance that gave rise to the misrepresentation has resulted, or is reasonably likely to result in, a material adverse effect and such misrepresentation or material adverse effect continues uncured for 30 or more days from the date a responsible officer of the Issuer obtains knowledge thereof; and

 7. certain events of bankruptcy described in the Conditions affecting the Issuer, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are Significant Subsidiaries or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

 It shall not be an Event of Default in the case of any default by a Restricted Subsidiary described under clauses 4, 5, 6 or 7 of the first paragraph above if at the time of such default the Debt Service Cover Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, after excluding Debt Service and Net Cash Flow for any such defaulting Restricted Subsidiary, is at least 1.25 to 1.0. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause 7 of the first paragraph above) shall occur and be continuing and has not been cured or waived, the Trustee may or, if instructed by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding Notes, shall (subject in all cases to the Trustee being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) declare the unpaid principal of (and premium, if any) and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable by notice in writing to the Issuer, specifying the Event of Default and that it is a “notice of acceleration”. If an Event of Default specified in clause 7 of the first paragraph above occurs, then the unpaid principal of (and premium, if any) and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

 In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause 4 of the first paragraph above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default that triggered such Event of Default pursuant to clause 4 of the first paragraph above shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of declaration of acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes as described in the preceding paragraph, the Trustee (if so instructed by, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes) may rescind and cancel such declaration and its consequences by written notice to the Issuer:

 1. if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree;

 87


-----

###### 2. if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived, except non-payment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration; and

 3. to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue instalments of interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid.

 No rescission will affect any subsequent Default or impair any rights relating thereto.

 The Trustee (acting on the directions of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Notes) may waive any existing Default or Event of Default under this “Description of Additional Notes”, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.

 Subject to all provisions of the Trust Deed, the Conditions and applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or directing the Trustee to exercise its rights or powers conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Trust Deed at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee.

 The Trustee may at its discretion and without further notice, institute such proceedings as it thinks fit to enforce its rights under the Trust Deed in respect of the Notes and the Trust Deed, but it shall not be bound to do so, unless so requested in writing by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and in any such case, only if it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all liabilities to which it may thereby become liable, or which it may incur by so doing.

 No Holder of Notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Trust Deed or for any remedy thereunder, unless:

 1. such Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

 2. Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee;

 3. such Holders of Notes provide to the Trustee satisfactory indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding; and

 4. the Trustee fails to comply within a reasonable period after receipt of such notice and offer of indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding (as applicable) and such failure is continuing.

 Notwithstanding any other term of this “Description of Additional Notes” or the Conditions, no Permitted Reorganisation shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any undertaking or other term in this “Description of Additional Notes” or a Default or an Event of Default, and shall be expressly permitted under the terms of this “Description of Additional Notes” or the Conditions.

 The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Trust Deed. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

 The Trust Deed provides that (i) if a Default for failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at that time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action; and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time period prescribed in the covenant entitled “Reports to Holders” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Trust Deed shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the preserved period specified in the Trust Deed.

 Limited Condition Acquisition

 When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under this “Description of Additional Notes”, in each case in connection with any merger, acquisition, disposition, joint venture, Investment or other similar transaction, in each case where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness or Restricted Payments, any calculation of the Debt Service, Net Cash Flow, Debt Service Cover Ratio, Total

 88

 Satisfaction and Discharge

 The Trust Deed (other than those provisions which by their express terms survive) and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding Notes when:

 1. either:

 (a) all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Registrar for cancellation; or

 (b) (i) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Registrar for cancellation have become due and payable or will become due and payable at the stated date for payment thereof within one year or will be called for redemption within one year or (ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Registrar for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise, and, in each case, the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) funds which shall be held on deposit in euros sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on Notes not theretofore delivered to the Registrar for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Notes to the date of deposit, together with an irrevocable request from the Issuer to the Trustee (or the other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) to apply such funds to the payment;

 2. no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of the deposit pursuant to paragraph 1 above (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings), and the deposit shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Trust Deed) to which the Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound;

###### 4. the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel (upon which the Trustee shall be entitled to rely without further enquiry or liability) stating that all conditions precedent under the Trust Deed relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Trust Deed have been complied with.

 All funds deposited with the Trustee (or the other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) pursuant to the above provisions shall be held on trust and the Trustee shall apply such funds or cause the payment to be effected (subject as set out below), in accordance with the Conditions and Notes, toward payment (either directly or through any Paying Agent as the Trustee may determine) to the persons entitled thereto, of the principal, premium (if any) and interest in respect of the applicable Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, for whose payment such funds have been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), however such funds need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

 If the Trustee or a Paying Agent (or any other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) is unable to apply any amounts with respect to certain Notes in accordance with the above by reason of any (i) legal proceeding or any order or judgement of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application or (ii) bankruptcy, insolvency or analogous proceedings affecting any entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee pursuant to these “Satisfaction and Discharge” provisions, the Issuer’s obligations under the Trust Deed and such Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to these “Satisfaction and Discharge” provisions, provided that if the Issuer had made any payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest and Additional Amounts on such Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the relevant Holders to receive such payment.

 Any such modification, authorisation or waiver shall be binding on the Holders and shall be notified to the Holders as soon as practicable.

 From time to time and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this “Description of Additional Notes”, the Trustee shall (provided that no such amendment and/or modification does, in the sole opinion of the Trustee, impose additional liabilities or obligations on it, and/or reduce its rights or protections, under the Trust Deed or the Notes): (i) concur with the Issuer in, and/or (ii) provide instructions to the Security Trustee (as applicable), without the consent of the Holders, to make any amendments or modification the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Security Documents (as the case may be) to:

 1. enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents;

 2. (i) release Security in accordance with the Conditions and/or the Security Documents, or (ii) temporarily release Security to the extent necessary (the details of such temporary release as set forth in reasonable detail in the requisite Officer’s Certificate, in a form satisfactory, and delivered to, the Security Trustee) to secure permitted Pari Passu Liabilities or Super Senior Liabilities by such Security, provided that the temporarily released Security shall be released only for so long as necessary to secure permitted Pari Passu Liabilities or Super Senior Liabilities by such Security and shall thereafter be reinstated and secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes; or

###### or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, the Additional Notes and any Subsequent Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes).

 Unless consented to by Holders holding at least 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes, no amendment, supplement or waiver may:

 1. reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

 2. reduce the rate of, or change or have the effect of changing, the time for payment of interest on the Notes;

 3. reduce the principal of, or change or have the effect of changing, the fixed maturity of the Notes, alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes, or alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to the covenants described under “—Change of Control” and “— Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” after the obligation to repurchase the Notes has arisen;

 4. waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

 5. make the Notes payable in a currency other than that stated in the Notes;

 6. make any change in the Conditions relating to waivers of past Defaults; and

 In connection with executing any amendment or supplement, the Trustee shall receive, and be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s Certificate and such other documents as prescribed by the Trust Deed.

 The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Trust Deed to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under the Trust Deed becomes effective, the Issuer will be required to give notice to the Holders as provided under “—Notices” briefly describing such amendment, supplement or waiver, and, for so long as the Notes are listed and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer shall notify such exchange thereof. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

 From time to time and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this “Description of Additional Notes” the Security Trustee may concur with the Issuer in making any amendments or modification to the Security Documents in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

 Notices

 Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made, and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Trust Deed or the Notes, where the Trust Deed or the Notes provides for notice of any event (including any notice of redemption) to any Holder of an interest in the Global Note (whether by mail or otherwise), such notice shall be sufficiently given if given to the Common Depositary for such Global Note (or its designee) according to the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream. As from the date on which the Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin, and for so long as the Notes are listed on such exchange and the rules of such exchange require, each notice or communication provided to the Holders of the Notes shall be published by the Issuer on the official website of such exchange.

 Governing Law; Jurisdiction

 Each of the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement is or will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of England and Wales. The Pledge Agreements will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the jurisdiction in which the relevant Pledged Subsidiary is organised. The Issuer consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts and has appointed an agent for service of process with respect to any actions brought in these courts arising out of, or based on, the Trust Deed or the Notes.

 Concerning the Trustee

 Subject to the provisions of the Trust Deed relating to the duties of the Trustee, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Trust Deed at the request of any Holder of Notes, unless such Holder will have offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

 With respect to any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens (including, in each case, any such restriction set forth in a defined term) or for purposes of any other determination under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”, all amounts Incurred, outstanding or proposed to be Incurred or outstanding in currencies other than euro shall be calculated by the Issuer based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such Incurrence (or, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness, the date on which such Indebtedness was first committed) or on the date such applicable action was taken; provided that (i) in the cases of Indebtedness and Liens, (a) if Indebtedness is Incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such Refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being Refinanced, plus an amount equal to premiums, defeasance costs and fees and expenses in connection therewith and (b) the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being Refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such Refinancing and (ii) if the amount of any basket described under “—Certain Covenants” is exceeded as a result of fluctuations in the applicable currency exchange rates after the last time such basket was utilised, such basket will be deemed not to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

 In addition, if any basket set forth under “—Certain Covenants” (or in any defined term used therein) is exceeded as a result of fluctuations to Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets after the last time such basket was calculated for any purpose under “—Certain Covenants” (or in any defined term used therein), such basket will be deemed not to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations.

###### BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM

 General

 The Additional Notes will be represented on issue by a global note certificate in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Global Note”).

 The Additional Notes will share the same ISIN and Common Code as the Original Notes and will be fully fungible therewith.

 The Global Note will be deposited with and registered in the name of a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Additional Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

 While the Additional Notes are in global form, holders of beneficial interests in the Global Note (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will not be considered the owners or “Holders” of Notes for any purpose. So long as the Additional Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the Holders of Additional Notes for all purposes under the Trust Deed. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of Holders under the Trust Deed. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

 Beneficial interests in the Global Note will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants. Investors may hold notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organisations that are participants in such systems.

 The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. Except as set forth below, the Global Note may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream as applicable, or to a successor of Euroclear or Clearstream as applicable, or their nominees. Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note may not be exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Individual Notes Certificates”) except in the limited circumstances described below. Please see “—Exchange of the Global Note for Individual Notes Certificates”. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.

 Payments on the Global Note

 Payment of amounts owing in respect of the Global Note (including principal, interest and premium, if any) will be made by the Issuer in Euros to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

 Under the terms of the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement, the Issuer, the Paying Agents, Registrar and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Note (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Paying Agents, Registrar and Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

 • any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participants, or for maintaining supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

###### • any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant. Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name”.

 Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests

 Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Additional Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Note. However, if there is an event of default under the Additional Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Note for Individual Notes Certificates, and to distribute such Individual Notes Certificates to their respective participants.

 Exchange of the Global Note for Individual Notes Certificates

 The Global Note is exchangeable for Individual Notes Certificates if:

 (1) either Euroclear or Clearstream is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease business and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer; or

 (2) the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following the occurrence of any of the circumstances described in Condition 11 (Events of Default) of the terms and conditions of the Additional Notes as appended to the Trust Deed and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Trust Deed.

 Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

 All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

 Euroclear and Clearstream

 Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

 Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System

 The notes represented by the Global Note are expected to be listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market.

 The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

 Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Note among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation

###### to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

###### TAX CONSIDERATIONS

 The following is a summary of certain tax consequences of the Offering and is intended as general information only. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Additional Notes. In particular, this description does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This description is based on the laws of France currently in force and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

 PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF ADDITIONAL NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES, UNDER THE TAX LAWS OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE RESIDENT FOR TAX PURPOSES AND UNDER THE TAX LAWS OF FRANCE OF ACQUIRING, HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF ADDITIONAL NOTES AND RECEIVING PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS UNDER THE ADDITIONAL NOTES. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THIS SECTION IS LIMITED TO TAXATION ISSUES, AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD NOT APPLY ANY INFORMATION SET OUT BELOW TO OTHER AREAS, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) THE LEGALITY OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE ADDITIONAL NOTES.

 European Union: the proposed Financial Transaction Tax (“FTT”)

 On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “Participating Member States”) and Estonia. However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

 The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Additional Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Additional Notes should, however, be exempt.

 Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Additional Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

 The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate or to withdraw.

 Prospective holders of the Additional Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

 France

 The following is a summary of certain material French tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposal of the Additional Notes, realised by a holder of the Additional Notes that: (i) is not a shareholder of the Issuer; (ii) is not related to the Issuer within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code; and (iii) does not hold the Additional Notes in connection with a business or profession conducted in France, or a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in France. Furthermore, this summary does not address any French estate or gift tax considerations.

 This is a general summary and the tax consequences as described here may not apply to a holder of Additional Notes. Any potential investors should consult their own tax advisers for more information about the tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Additional Notes in their particular circumstances.

 PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS AS TO FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL OF THE ADDITIONAL NOTES IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

 In addition, Article 1649 AC of the French Tax Code imposes on financial institutions within the meaning of Article 1 of Decree n°2016-1683 to review and collect information on their clients and investors, in order to identify their tax residence, as well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign tax authorities (via the French tax authorities) on an annual basis.

###### Payments of interest and other revenue in respect of the Additional Notes made outside France

 Payments of interest and assimilated revenue made by the Issuer with respect to the Additional Notes will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”), irrespective of the holder’s residence for tax purposes or registered headquarters. Pursuant to Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, if such payments under the Additional Notes are made in a Non-Cooperative State other than those referred to in Article 238-0 A, 2 bis-2° of the French Tax Code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable (subject to certain exceptions, certain of which are set forth below and to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté), and may be updated annually. This list was last updated by a ministerial executive order of 26 February 2021 (see “Risk Factors—Risks relating to taxation—The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where the Group operates may impact the financial results of the Group”). 

 Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and other assimilated revenue on the Additional Notes may not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable income, if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and other revenue may be re-characterised as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case such non-deductible interest and other assimilated revenue may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code at a rate of (i) 75% if they are paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in a Non-Cooperative State other than those referred to in Article 238-0 A, 2bis-2°of the French Tax Code; (ii) 26.5% (for fiscal years beginning as from 1 January 2021 - to be reduced to match the planned reduction of the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219 I of the French Tax Code, to 25% for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2022) if they are paid to corporate or other legal entities who are not French tax residents; or (iii) 12.8% for payments made to individuals who are not French tax residents, (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty).

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code nor, to the extent the relevant interest relate to genuine transactions and is not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion (and therefore the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of the Deductibility Exclusion), will apply in respect of a particular issue of Additional Notes, if the Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of such issue of the Additional Notes were not to enable payments of interest or other similar revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

 However, pursuant to the French administrative guidelines in Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20-24/02/2021 n° 290 and BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30-24/02/2021 n° 150 (the “Administrative Guidelines”), an issue of Additional Notes will benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any proof of the main purpose and effect of such issue of Additional Notes, and accordingly will be able to benefit from the Exception (the “Safe Harbour”), if such Notes are:

 i. offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State which is not a Non-Cooperative State. For this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or

 ii. admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

 iii. admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

 The Additional Notes issued under this Offering Memorandum qualify as debt securities under French commercial law. Considering that: (i) as at the date of their admission to trading, the Additional Notes will be admitted to trading on the Official List of Euronext Dublin which does not qualify as a Non-Cooperative State and that such market is operated

 118


-----

###### by a market operator which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and/or (ii) the Additional Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments of interest and other assimilated revenue in respect of the Additional Notes made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Additional Notes will fall under the Safe Harbour. 

 Accordingly, such payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Additional Notes will benefit from the Exception. Moreover, under the same conditions since the relevant interest and other assimilated revenue should be considered as relating to genuine transactions and not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and other assimilated revenue in respect of the Additional Notes paid by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Additional Notes will be subject, pursuant to the Administrative Guidelines, neither to the Deductibility Exclusion nor to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid or accrued to a person domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State.

 Withholding tax applicable to payments made to individuals fiscally domiciled in France

 Pursuant to Article 125 A of the French Tax Code, where the paying agent (établissement payeur) is established in France and subject to certain limited exceptions, interest and other similar income received by individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France are subject to a 12.8% mandatory withholding tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied by way of withholding tax at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on interest and similar income paid to individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France. Practical steps to be taken for the purposes of levying this withholding tax and social contributions will depend on the place where the paying agent is located.

 Prospective purchasers of Additional Notes who are French resident for tax purposes or who would hold such Notes through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France should be aware that transactions involving the Additional Notes, including any purchase or disposal of, or other dealings in, the Additional Notes, may have French tax consequences. The tax consequences regarding interest, premium on redemption and capital gains may depend, amongst other things, upon the status of the prospective purchaser (i.e. legal entities or individuals). Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes should consult their own tax advisers about the French tax implications of purchasing, holding, disposing the Additional Notes and more generally of any transactions involving Additional Notes.

 Sale, disposal or redemption of the Additional Notes

 Pursuant to Article 244 bis C of the French Tax Code, a holder of Additional Notes who is not a resident of France for French tax purposes and who does not hold his Additional Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in France, will not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains realised on the sale, exchange or other disposal of Additional Notes.

 Pursuant to Article 150-0 A of the French Tax Code, an individual holding Additional Notes and fiscally domiciled in France will be subject to a 12.8% mandatory withholding tax in respect of the gains realised on the sale, exchange or other disposal of Additional Notes, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on gains realised on the sale, exchange or other disposal of Additional Notes to individuals fiscally domiciled in France.

 In addition, no stamp or registration fee or duty or similar transfer taxes will be payable in France in connection with the sale, disposal or redemption of Additional Notes, except in the case of filing with the French tax authorities on a voluntary basis, or to the extent that the FTT would become applicable. See “Tax Considerations—European Union: the Proposed Financial Transaction Tax (“FTT”)”.

###### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

 The following is a summary of certain insolvency and other legal considerations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer is incorporated. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the Notes. In addition, the laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect of certain matters and laws in multiple jurisdictions could result in disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, which could adversely affect your rights and your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Notes. Prospective investors in the Additional Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to all such limitations and considerations.

 European Union

 The Issuer and certain other Group companies are currently organised under the laws of a Member State or Member States of the European Union (in this section references to Member States exclude Denmark).

 Main Insolvency proceedings

 Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 20 May 2015 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which replaced the Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings, the court which has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State in which that company has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”). The forms of insolvency proceedings which can comprise main proceedings are listed in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation and include, in respect of the UK, administration, compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation with confirmation by the court (see further “Administration” and “Liquidation” below).

 Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place where its registered office is located. This rebuttable presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of main insolvency proceedings. The Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 remains applicable to insolvency proceedings opened before the EU Insolvency Regulation came into effect.

 The European Court of Justice has held that the presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place of its registered office can only be rebutted if factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties (meaning that they are already in the public domain and what a typical third party would learn as a result of dealing with the company, without making specific enquiries) indicate that the company’s COMI is elsewhere (Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/2004). Factors which may be taken into account include the location of any regulatory authorities and the places where the company’s business is managed and operated, board meetings held and the accounts prepared and audited.

 The EU Insolvency Regulation specifically states in the Recitals (Recital 30) that the presumption of the centre of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in a member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other member state. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a company conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the centre of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

 Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the presumption cannot be rebutted (Interedil Srl (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil Srl and another C-396/09).

 The point at which a company’s COMI falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened—although note that there is the three month look back period as regards the presumption of the company’s COMI.

 Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognised in other Member States, although secondary proceedings may additionally be opened in any Member State where the company has an “establishment”. An establishment is defined in Article 2(10) as a place of operations where a company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic

 120


-----

###### activity with human means and assets. This means a fixed place of business and dealings with third parties (as opposed to purely internal administration). The effect of secondary proceedings is limited to the assets located in that Member State.

 The EU Insolvency Regulation contains provisions dealing with the co-ordination of main and secondary proceedings, as well as provisions dealing with insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies.

 The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union took effect on 31 January 2020 (exit day). The UK is no longer an EU Member State. However, in accordance with the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (the “Withdrawal Agreement”), which was implemented by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, the UK has entered an implementation period, during which it continues to be subject to EU law. The implementation period will cease on 31 December 2020 at 11pm (implementation period completion day). Following implementation period completion day, most of the EU Insolvency Regulation is repealed and will no longer apply to the UK. Article 67(3) of the Withdrawal Agreement, provides that the EU Insolvency Regulation will continue to apply provided that the main proceedings were opened before the implementation period completion day.

 In some circumstances, recognition of UK judgments, proceedings and procedures would be facilitated by the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency as adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 30 May 1997 (the Model Law) where it has been adopted by a particular EU member state. However, to date, only Greece, Slovenia, Poland and Romania have adopted the Model Law. Where the Model Law has not been adopted, recognition would depend on private international rules in local EU Member States and, in some circumstances, parallel proceedings may need to be opened. This would increase risk when implementing and giving effect to cross-border restructuring and/or insolvency proceedings. At worst, this would involve a competing insolvency proceeding taking place outside of the UK. In cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the EU accepted COMI rules approach, it is less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.

 France

 Insolvency

 The provisions of French law relating to insolvency and bankruptcy have been significantly amended by ordinance 2021-1193 dated 15 September 2021 which shall enter into force on 1 October 2021 which was completed by decree n°2021-1218 dated 23 September 2021 (together, the 2021 Ordinance). The descriptions of French insolvency and bankruptcy laws contained in this section are based on literal interpretations of the 2021 Ordinance which could differ from the interpretation which will be given to the terms of the 2021 Ordinance by scholars, pre-insolvency and insolvency practitioners and by case law. 

 To the extent that the registered office of the Issuer (and other companies of the Group as the case may be) is in France, they could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation). In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main centre of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, or they have an establishment in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings or accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde or sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganisation proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

 In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above, and to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group.

 In general, French insolvency legislation favours the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Additional Notes and corresponding security interests in the Security.

 Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard (accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been suppressed by the 2021 Ordinance), judicial reorganisation and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France would be subject to French main insolvency proceedings and any

 121


-----

###### company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings.

 The following is a general discussion of preventative and insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Additional Notes. 

 Temporary Measures in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic

 Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government implemented ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, ordinance n° 2020-596, ordinance n° 2020-1443 and law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020. Such ordinances and law provide for specific provisions applicable for a limited period of time to pre-insolvency and insolvency situation under French law (the COVID-19 Temporary Framework).

 In particular, until December 31, 2021, pursuant to Article 1 of ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020, in force as from November 26, 2020, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation proceedings may be extended one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a maximum of ten months (see “— Conciliation Proceedings” below).

 In addition, Article 124 of law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020 extends until December 31, 2021 the following measures that were initially adopted by ordinance n°2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, in force as from May 21, 2020 that were due to expire on December 31, 2020:

 • additional specific measures aimed at protecting debtors and an adaptation of the provisions governing grace periods in the context of conciliation proceedings (see “—Conciliation Proceedings” and “—Grace Periods” below);

 • the right of the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire), at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’ representative, to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement proposal the deadline during which creditors can respond to a debt settlement proposal in the context of a standard consultation for the approval of a safeguard or reorganisation plan; and

 • the possible up to two-year extension of the duration of the safeguard or reorganisation plan, as a result of which such a plan can now last up to 12 years.

 Some of the measures initially adopted by the COVID-19 Temporary Framework have been included in the 2021 Ordinance. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may be put in place within the following weeks or months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law.

 Grace periods

 In addition to and independently from the specific provisions of insolvency laws discussed below, the holders of the Additional Notes as our creditors could also be subject to Articles 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

 Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the prevailing legal rate as published twice a year by administrative decree of the Ministry of Economy) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant court. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “Conciliation Proceedings” below).

 Insolvency (Cessation des Paiements) Under French Law

 Under French law, a company is insolvent (in a state of cessation des paiements) when it is not able to pay its debts which are due and payable with its available assets taking into account available credit lines and moratoria.

 122


-----

###### The court order may set the date of insolvency up to 18 months before the date of the court order commencing judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte) (see below).

 Court-assisted Pre-insolvency Proceedings

 Pre-insolvency proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion; provided that it experiences or anticipates legal, economic or financial difficulties:

 (i) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements in case of mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings, or

 (ii) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements for more than 45 days in case of conciliation proceedings only.

 Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are informal and confidential (subject to the below as regards conciliation proceedings) proceedings carried out under the supervision of the president of the court. The president of the competent court will appoint an officer (as the case may be, a mandataire ad hoc or a conciliator) in order to help the debtor company reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders, in particular by reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. Such proceedings are non-binding since the court-appointed intermediary has no power to force the parties to accept an agreement and the dissenting creditors will not be bound by the arrangement, if any. Except under specific circumstances or temporary provisions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they generally abstain from doing so, to try and negotiate a consensual restructuring.

 Contractual provisions modifying the conditions for the performance of an ongoing contract, by diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or the opening of conciliation proceedings or any request made to this end are deemed null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or the opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor’s counsel relating to such proceedings for the portion that would exceed three quarters of the total fee of the relevant counsel are null and void.

 Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

 Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings

 In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing difficulties of an economic or financial nature but are not insolvent (“en état de cessation des paiements”). There is no time limit for the duration of mandat ad hoc proceedings. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of the court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc, whose name can be suggested by the debtor and whose duties are determined by the court appointing him, usually to facilitate negotiations with the creditors) can be reported to the president of the court but, unlike in conciliation proceedings, French law does not provide for any approval by the court or recognition by the president of the court with the related specific consequences. This restructuring agreement between the company and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. The mandataire ad hoc is appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with creditors but cannot coerce the latter into accepting any proposal. Such proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure for statutory auditors, if any).

 In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the court for a grace period as set forth in Articles 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code.

 Conciliation Proceedings

 Conciliation proceedings are available to debtors that face current or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature but which have not been insolvent (in a state of cessation des paiements) for more than 45 days. The debtor petitions the president of the relevant court for the appointment of a “conciliator” (whose name the debtor can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners an agreement, that puts an end to its difficulties, providing e.g. for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings may last

 123


-----

###### up to four months (with the conciliator being able to request an extension up to five months). Such proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure for statutory auditors, if any). 

 Whilst no general stay is imposed on creditors, which may therefore continue to sue the debtor for payment of their claims, the following measures may affect creditors’ rights during conciliation proceedings:

 (i) if the debtor receives a formal notice from a creditor requesting payment or faces enforcement measures, or if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer payment of its claim, the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings to grant, after having heard the conciliator, a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace Periods” above);

 (ii) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer payment of its claim that are not yet due for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings may, after having heard the conciliator, defer or reschedule that creditor’s claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings; and

 (iii) creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor.

 Creditors usually in practice restrain themselves from taking any such enforcement action in order to negotiate a consensual restructuring.

 Some specific measures adopted as part of the COVID-19 Temporary Framework have modified conciliation proceedings to provide that, until December 31, 2021:

 1. the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator, thereby increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of 5 months previously);

 2. if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer payment of its claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the President of the court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:

 a) the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment default;
 or

 b) the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable
 property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor.

 3. the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace Periods” above) even before the creditor sends any formal notice requesting payment or initiates any suit for payment, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of its claim for the duration of the conciliation.

 The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

 Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works council, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above, except that in addition:

 • the decision of approval by the relevant court will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential (subject to certain exceptions);

 • creditors who, as part of the approved agreement or during the course of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the distressed company

 124


-----

###### (other than shareholders providing new equity) will benefit from a specific protection (the so-called “New Money Lien”) and as such enjoy priority of payment over all pre-petition and post-petition claims (other than certain pre-petition employment claims and post-petition procedural costs), in the event of subsequent court- administered proceedings;

 • in the event of subsequent court-administered proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not be rescheduled and these claims may not be written-off without their holders’ consent, and

 • in the event of subsequent judicial reorganisation proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of the cessation des paiements (and therefore the starting date of the “hardening period” as defined below) cannot be determined by the court to be at a date earlier than the date of the approval of the agreement by the court, except in case of fraud.

 Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution. 

 While the agreement is in force:

 • any legal action and suit for payment in respect of claims which were dealt with in the conciliation agreement is prohibited;

 • the court may impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement; and

 • interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded.

 If the debtor breaches the agreement, whether approved or acknowledged, any party thereto can petition the court for its rescission. The rescission of the agreement will not apply to the clauses of the agreement organizing the consequences of such rescission and such clauses shall continue to apply. The commencement of subsequent court-administered proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

 Court-administered Proceedings

 The following French proceedings may be initiated in France by or against a company:

 • safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée), upon petition by the debtor only if, while not being in a state of cessation des paiements (or for accelerated safeguard proceedings, if in cessation des paiements for less than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation proceedings), it is facing difficulties which it cannot overcome. Absent any difficulties it cannot overcome, the court will invite the debtor to file for conciliation proceedings. The conditions for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) are described below.

 • judicial reorganisation proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor if the debtor is in cessation des paiements. Judicial reorganisation proceedings are available to companies whose recovery prospects are possible while judicial liquidation proceedings are available to companies whose recovery is manifestly impossible.

 While a company may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing insurmountable difficulties, it is required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings within 45 days of becoming in a state of cessation des paiements. Alternatively, the debtor may request the opening of conciliation proceedings within the same timeframe. If it does not, de jure managers and, as the case may be, de facto managers of the company, may be subject to civil liability.

 A lien (the Post Commencement Lien) applies to certain claims arising after the commencement of the proceedings that are incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services

 125


-----

###### rendered/goods delivered to the debtor. The Post Commencement Lien may also apply to new cash contributions made in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor's business during such proceedings, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person (i) during the observation period in safeguard or judicial reorganisation proceedings or the temporary continuation of business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in which case such cash contributions must be authorised by the insolvency judge, or (ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganisation plan, including when such plan is being amended, it being specified that the judgment endorsing or modifying the plan must mention all new cash contributions benefiting from the Post Commencement Lien, as well as the relevant amounts.

 Claims benefiting from the Post Commencement Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement claims in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganisation proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, except with respect to claims secured by a retention right, employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and the New Money Lien, pre-petition claims secured by real estate security (in judicial liquidation proceedings only) and post-petition wages claims not advanced by the French wages guarantee fund. Claims benefitting from the Post Commencement Lien cannot be the subject of any rescheduling or waiver without the consent of their holders.

 Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard

 A debtor which experiences difficulties that is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “Insolvency”). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court- appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

 The court may convert such safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganisation proceedings in certain circumstances.

 Creditors whose rights are affected by the plan must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

 Standard consultation: this applies to debtors for which the class-based consultation is not mandatory or requested by the debtor with the consent of the bankruptcy judge (as described below).

 In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who informs each creditor who filed a claim. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

 The duration of the plan is determined by the court and may not exceed ten years, or 15 years in relation to agricultural or maritime fishing businesses.

 Pursuant to Article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until December 31, 2021 the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses.

 Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

 Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than write-off or debt-for-equity-swap proposals) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as a controller (contrôleur).

 Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until December 31, 2021 the abovementioned 30-day delay

 126


-----

###### may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the court-appointed creditors’ representative.

 Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the Post Commencement Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

 Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had it been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. In the third, fourth and fifth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim, and at least 10% of the amount of each debt claim as from the sixth year, except for agricultural businesses (subject to a maximum duration of the plan of ten years, except for agricultural businesses and as a result of temporary COVID-19 measures).

 Class-based consultation: this applies mandatorily in case of accelerated safeguard proceedings (see below) and, in case of safeguard and judicial reorganisation proceedings, to (i) companies that either (x) employ at least 250 employees and have a net turnover of at least €20 million or (y) have a net turnover of at least €40 million, and (ii) companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds. This could also apply, in case these thresholds are not met, upon the debtor’s request (in safeguard proceedings) or upon the debtor's or the judicial administrator's request (in judicial reorganisation proceedings), in each case with the consent of the bankruptcy judge.

 Only affected parties (parties affectées) are entitled to vote on the draft restructuring plan. These affected parties being (i) creditors whose rights are directly affected by the proposed draft restructuring plan and (ii) equity holders (détenteurs de capital), if their equity interest in the debtor, the articles of association, or their rights are modified by the proposed restructuring plan.

 The constitution of classes of creditors is made under the responsibility of the judicial administrator, who will, on the basis of objective and verifiable criteria, group within the same class creditors sharing sufficient common economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante). Claims taken into account are those indicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, in the absence of an auditor, in a certificate from the debtor's certified public accountant.

 In determining the composition of each class the judicial administrator shall ensure that (i) creditors benefiting from “rights in rem” security (sûretés réelles) over the debtor's assets and other creditors are in separate classes, (ii) the determination of each class complies with the subordination arrangements entered into before the opening of the relevant proceedings (provided that these subordination arrangements have been provided to the judicial administrator within 10 days of receipt of the notice sent by the judicial administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the affected parties to notify the existence of such arrangements) and (iii) equity holders are grouped in one or several classes. The judicial administrator can also create “ad hoc” classes, for example for public creditors or strategic suppliers.

 At least 21 days prior to the date of the vote on the draft restructuring plan, the judicial administrator shall notify each affected party of the methods of class allocation and computation of voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights enabling them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into account for the computation of the voting rights is the one indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor or certified public accountant. The methods used are also notified to the court-appointed creditor’s representative. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be brought before the insolvency judge at the request of the affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the court-appointed creditor’s representative or the judicial administrator.

 The restructuring plan will be adopted once each class has voted on it by a two-third majority of the votes cast. The affected parties must vote within 20 to 30 days following receipt of the draft restructuring plan. This timeframe may be increased or decreased following a request by the debtor or the judicial administrator to the judge but cannot be less than 15 days. Within each class, the vote on the approval of the plan may be replaced by an agreement from the required majority.

 127


-----

###### If the draft restructuring plan is approved by all classes under the required conditions and majority rules, the court will nevertheless have to make sure that certain conditions are met before approving the draft restructuring plan:

 • the restructuring plan has been approved in accordance with the rules governing the constitution of classes of affected parties; 

 • creditors of the same class sharing sufficient common interests benefit from an equal treatment and are treated in proportion to their claims or rights;

 • the restructuring plan has been duly notified to all affected parties; 

 • in the presence of dissenting creditors, the restructuring plan does not put those dissenting creditor in a less favourable position than the position they would have been in (i) if the order of priority of the distribution of asset sale proceeds in judicial liquidation proceedings, or the sale price of the business as a going concern via an asset sale plan (plan de cession) pursuant to article L. 642-1 of the French Commercial Code were to apply or (ii) in the event of a better alternative solution if the restructuring plan were not to be approved; 

 • to the extent applicable any new financing provided for in the restructuring plan is necessary for its implementation and does not unduly affect (ne porte pas une atteinte excessive aux) the interests of the affected parties. 

 Even if these criteria are met, the court may refuse to approve a restructuring plan which does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the insolvency of the company (state of cessation des paiements) or ensures business continuity (viabilité de l’entreprise). The court must also ensure that the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected.

 When the restructuring plan is not approved by all classes of creditors but only by a majority of (or one of) them, it may nevertheless be adopted by the court upon request made by the debtor or the judicial administrator with the consent of the debtor and imposed on the dissenting classes by means of a “cross-class cram down” (application forcée interclasses), provided that the plan meets the above mentioned conditions along with several additional conditions, including that:

 • the restructuring plan has been approved in accordance with the rules governing the approval of plans;

 • at least one of the following two criteria is met:

 • a majority of the classes of affected parties voted in favour of the plan, provided that at least one of those classes is a secured creditors’ class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors’ class (créanciers chirographaires); 

 • or, if the above criteria cannot be satisfied, at least one of the classes of affected parties, other than an equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment or retain any interest in the context of a judicial liquidation or an asset sale plan (plan de cession), has voted favourably;

 • affected creditors of a dissenting class are fully repaid by the same or equivalent means where, under the plan, a lower ranking class is entitled to a payment or retains an interest (intéressement) under the restructuring plan (the “absolute priority” rule);

 • no class of affected creditors may receive or maintain more than the total amount of its claims and interests;

 • when one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the restructuring plan:

 • the debtor (x) either employs at least 250 employees and has a net turnover of at least €20 million or (y) has a net turnover of €40 million (such thresholds applying to companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds); 

 128


-----

###### • based on the value of the debtor as a going concern, one may reasonably assume that the equity holders of one or several dissenting classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest in the context of a judicial liquidation or an asset sale plan (plan de cession); 

 • the shares issued, if the plan provides for a capital increase subscribed by cash contribution (which should include a subscription by way of set off), are offered in priority to the shareholders, pro rata their existing shareholding ; and 

 • the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of dissenting class or classes of equity holders.

 The court may depart from the “absolute priority” rule, with the agreement of the debtor, where such derogations are necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the plan and if the plan does not unduly prejudice (ne porte pas une atteinte excessive aux) the rights or interests of the affected parties. In particular, suppliers essential to the debtor's business, equity holders or holders of claims arising from the debtor’s tort liability are eligible for special treatment.

 The court decisions will constitute approval of the changes to the shareholding or to the rights of the equity holders or to the constitutional documents provided for in the restructuring plan. The court may designate a judicial mandataire to register in the debtor’s books the changes to the share capital and to carry out all acts necessary for the implementation of such amendments.

 Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings

 The 2021 Ordinance redesigned accelerated safeguard proceedings, by merging the previously existing accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. 

 A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée).

 The accelerated safeguard proceedings has been designed to “fast-track” the treatment of difficulties faced by companies and corresponds to the proceeding in which the approval of a plan by classes of affected parties is mandatory, as imposed by Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019.

 The maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is four months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial two-month period).

 The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

 When the accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan will be adopted only by creditors having the status of finance companies, credit institutions and the like, as well as by all holders of claims acquired from them or from a supplier of goods or services and, if applicable, bondholders, the debtor may request the opening of an accelerated safeguard proceeding, the effects of which shall be limited to these creditors.

 If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require affected parties’ classes (classes de parties affectées) (see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorise such constitution in the opening decision and the class-based consultation shall apply (see "Safeguard Proceedings").

 To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

 • the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings;

 • the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings;

 • its accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant;

 • as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and

 129


-----

###### • the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is likely to be supported by enough of its affected parties (parties affectées) so as to make the approval of the plan probable during the proceedings.

 If a plan is not approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court will terminate the proceedings.

 Judicial Reorganisation or Liquidation Proceedings

 General

 Judicial reorganisation (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be initiated against (including at the request of a creditor) or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability.

 Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganisation proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganisation proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganisation proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

 As soon as judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

 Judicial Reorganisation

 The objectives of judicial reorganisation proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

 An administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals for the reorganisation of the debtor (by assisting the debtor in the preparation of a draft judicial reorganisation plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan or organizing the sale of the business by way of an asset sale plan (plan de cession)). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court- appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial cessation of the business (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganisation proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities, including the following:

 • the plan is prepared and presented by the judicial administrator (with the assistance of the company as regards its preparation);

 • any affected party may prepare an alternative plan which shall be reported on by the judicial administrator and presented to the vote simultaneously with the plan prepared by the company provided that such alternative plan has been provided to the debtor and the judicial administrator at least 15 days before the date of the vote on the draft plan presented by the company; 

 • in case the plan is not approved by all classes any affected party may request from the court that it approves the plan by way of a cross class cram-down; and

 130


-----

###### • where the class-based consultation applies and the court does not approve the plan, a new plan must be prepared and standard consultation shall apply (including the court-imposed rescheduling described in "Safeguard Proceedings").

 In judicial reorganisation proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity (capitaux propres) to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital (capital social) as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may request from the court the appointment of a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favour of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganisation plan.

 In judicial reorganisation proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls one or more companies having together at least 150 employees (within the meaning of the French Labor Code), (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the judicial administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganisation plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

 • appoint a trustee (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganisation plan; or

 • order, in favour of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganisation plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholders’ meetings; any consent clause being deemed unwritten, the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

 In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

 In either of the above cases, the reorganisation plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganisation plan.

 Law n° 2021-689 May 31, 2021 has introduced a new insolvency procedure available up until June 2, 2023, which is entitled “procédure de traitement de sortie de crise” and can be summarised as an accelerated and simplified judicial reorganisation proceedings for small undertakings (in terms of employees and turnover), whose purpose is the endorsement of a debt rescheduling (the eligibility criteria are yet to be detailed in an upcoming ministerial decree).

 Judicial Liquidation

 If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

 Disposal of the debtor's assets will take place as follows:

 • a sale of business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organise such sale of the business as a going concern via an asset sale, i.e. an asset sale plan (plan de cession), any third party (as construed under French law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business); or

 131


-----

###### • a piecemeal sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

 • launch auction sales (vente aux enchères and adjudication amiable for real estate assets only);

 • sell by private sale (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorisation of the insolvency judge being necessary to enter into the sale agreement with the bidder); or

 • in practice, request, under the supervision of the insolvency judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has varied.

 If the court adopts a reorganisation or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

 The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain and the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

 The court may also terminate the proceedings:

 • when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or

 • in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

 The Observation Period and Its Outcome

 The period from the date of the court decision commencing the safeguard or judicial reorganisation proceedings and until the court makes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings is called the observation period (période d’observation) and may last up to twelve months (with six additional months for judicial reorganisation proceedings under exceptional circumstances and upon request of the public prosecutor) . During the observation period, the court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the company.

 Under safeguard proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is limited to either supervising the debtor’s management or assisting it, and in any case helping it prepare a safeguard plan for the company. In judicial reorganisation proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the reorganisation of the company, which proposals may include a reorganisation or an asset sale plan. In judicial reorganisation proceedings, the court may also decide that the court-appointed administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor’s management.

 At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the court will adopt a safeguard or a reorganisation plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts which may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire business, to a third party (a sale of the entire business is not possible under safeguard proceedings). At the end of the observation period of judicial reorganisation proceedings and, alternatively to a reorganisation plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have submitted bids. In such a case, the court orders such a (partial or entire) sale in the framework of a so-called “asset sale plan” (plan de cession), which consists of transferring assets, contracts and employees cherry- picked by the purchaser thereto, for a lump sum, in accordance with the bid submitted by the purchaser during the observation period.

 Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor's management and there is no observation period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote of the creditors, may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor’s assets in order to discharge the debtor’s liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorise a temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once for a period of three months at the public prosecutor’s request) whose effects are similar to an observation period.

###### The sales that have been pre-packed in mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings and that are deemed satisfactory will be implemented in the framework of subsequent court-administered proceedings through an expeditious process. Such sale could only relate to part (but not all) of the business of the debtor in safeguard proceedings.

 The “Hardening Period” (Période Suspecte) in Judicial Reorganisation and Liquidation Proceedings

 The date when the debtor becomes in a state of “cessation des paiements” is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may not be earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening period” (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

 Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court.

 Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of the debts that are due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, any security interest agreement or right of retention agreement granted on the debtor’s assets or rights for debts previously contracted unless they replace a previous security with at least an equivalent nature and basis and with the exception of the assignments of receivables provided under Article L. 313-23 of the French Monetary and Financial Code made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency, any legal mortgage (hypothèque légale) resulting from a judgment against the debtor for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarised declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526- 1 of the French Commercial Code.

 Voidable transactions include, transactions for consideration, payments made on debts that are due, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case, if such actions are taken after the debtor was in cessation des paiements and the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no consideration and notarised declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

 There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, since the condition required to commence such proceedings is that the company is not insolvent within the meaning of French law.

 Extension of Insolvency Proceedings

 French law provides that, upon the petition of the debtor, the public prosecutor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers or the liquidator, the insolvency proceedings of a company may be extended to another one, so that their respective assets and liabilities will be treated as belonging to one single insolvency estate, if (i) the debtor is deemed “fictitious,” i.e. a sham, or (ii) the debtor “commingled its assets and liabilities” with another entity, i.e. either it proves impossible to determine which assets and liabilities belong to each of them or “abnormal financial relationships” existed between the two entities (such as transfers of assets or funds without consideration).

 Status of Creditors During Safeguard, Judicial Reorganisation or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings

 Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or

 133


-----

###### increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. This possibility is excluded in the case of an accelerated safeguard. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of an asset sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the asset sale plan (plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

 During the observation period (and some of these rules continue to apply during the execution of the approved plan):

 • accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans having a maturity of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded);

 • the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorised by the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business and post-petition debts, unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

 • debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a “New Money Lien”), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganisation plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

 • in the context of judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours) will be required; 

 • creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is:

 • to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due) in order to file a proof of claim, as described below)

 • to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor; or

 • to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable, is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation; and

 • any increase in the scope of a contractual security or a contractual right of retention, by any means whatsoever, by the inclusion of goods or rights, or by transfer of the debtor's assets or rights, is prohibited. Any contrary provision, in particular relating to a transfer of property or rights of the debtor which have not yet arisen on the date of decision commencing the proceedings, is unenforceable as from the date of the court decision

 134


-----

###### opening the relevant proceedings. However, the increase in the scope may validly result from an assignment of a claim under Article L. 313-23 of the Monetary and Financial Code when it is made pursuant to a master assignment agreement entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings, or from an express derogation from this prohibition provided for in the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code.

 A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan and of a judicial reorganisation plan adopted by the court.

 In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of those proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business.

 As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of court- administered proceedings must file a proof of claim (déclaration de créances) with the creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of a claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors’ representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors’ representative save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except with respect to very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law.

 Under accelerated safeguard proceedings the claims held by parties affected (parties affectées) that took part in the conciliation proceedings are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have been filed. This list should include among other information, the subordination agreements brought to the debtor’s attention by the creditors before the opening of the proceeding. Although such affected parties (parties affectées) can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the 2 or 4 month time limit). Those affected parties (parties affectées) who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the above-mentioned deadlines.

 If the court adopts a safeguard plan, an accelerated safeguard plan or a reorganisation plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

 If the court adopts an asset sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganisation or liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator in charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking.

 French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employee claims, post-commencement legal costs (essentially court-officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a Post Commencement Lien (see above)and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to creditors who benefit from a Post Commencement Lien. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over certain assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

 Creditors’ Liability

 Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where insolvency proceedings, judicial reorganisation or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor on the following grounds: (i) fraud; (ii) clear interference with the management (immixtion caractérisée dans la gestion) of the debtor; or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. Case law has recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be deemed wrongful.

 If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company (dirigeant de fait). In such case, Article L.651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation

 135


-----

###### proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.

 However, a manager (whether de jure or de facto) cannot be held liable on the basis of Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code in cases of “simple negligence” (simple négligence) in the management of the company.

 England and Wales

 Certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries have registered offices located in England and Wales. Therefore any insolvency proceedings in respect of such entities would likely be commenced in England and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. The scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency (and restructuring) proceedings available in England and Wales, further detail is set out below. To the extent that such entities have any assets and/or creditors in any overseas jurisdictions and enters into insolvency proceedings in England, recognition of those proceedings in such other jurisdictions is likely to be a relevant consideration. Such recognition would be a matter for the private international law of the relevant jurisdictions. 

 However, insolvency proceedings in relation to certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries could also be opened in a country other than England and Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the jurisdiction in which those insolvency proceedings were to be commenced. By way of example, where a debtor has its centre of main interest for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation in a member state of the EU, then (and subject to certain exceptions), insolvency proceedings in relation to that debtor could be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. 

 If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales such proceedings could be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such foreign proceedings would not benefit from automatic recognition in England, although the foreign officeholder could apply under the Model Law Regulations (see below), which provide that foreign insolvency proceedings may be recognised in England where a company has its centre of main interest (as that concept is used in the Model Law Regulations) or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non transitory economic activity with human means and assets) in such foreign jurisdiction (see – “Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006” below).

 It is therefore not possible to say with certainty where insolvency proceedings will be brought. 

 Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006

 The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the “Model Law Regulations”) provide that the Model Law has the force of law in the United Kingdom, subject to certain modifications. To the extent that the Company has non-UK assets and/or foreign creditors which may be subject to or initiate foreign proceedings, the application of the Model Law will be relevant.

 The Model Law Regulations apply where (i) assistance is sought the United Kingdom by a foreign court or a foreign representative in connection with a foreign proceeding, or (ii) assistance is sought in a foreign state in connection with a proceeding under British insolvency law, or (iii) a foreign proceeding and a proceeding under British insolvency law in respect of the same company are taking place concurrently or (iv) creditors or other interested parties in a foreign state have an interest in requesting the commencement of, or participating in, a proceeding under British insolvency law.

 The Model Law Regulations provide for the recognition of two types of foreign insolvency proceedings (defined to be collective judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation): (i) “foreign main proceedings”, which can be opened in the state in which the company has its “centre of main interests” (which is subject to a rebuttable presumption that the company’s registered office is the centre of the company’s main interests and it should be noted that the centre of main interests for the purposes of the Model Law Regulations may be different from the centre of main interests of an entity for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation); and (ii) “foreign non-main proceedings”, which can be opened in the state in which the company possesses an “establishment” (defined as any place of operations where the company carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services).

 136


-----

###### A foreign representative (defined to be a person or body, including one appointed on an interim basis, authorised in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganisation or the liquidation of the company’s assets or affairs or to act as a representative of the foreign proceeding) appointed in a foreign main proceeding or foreign non-main proceeding (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) is entitled to apply to commence a proceeding under British insolvency law if the conditions for commencing such a proceeding are otherwise met.

 A foreign representative may apply to the court for recognition of the foreign proceeding in which the foreign representative has been appointed. From the time of filing of such an application until the time the application is decided upon, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative and where relief is urgently needed to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors, grant relief of a provisional nature. Such relief may include staying execution against the company’s assets, entrusting the administration or realisation of all or part of the company’s assets located in the United Kingdom to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) under the law of the United Kingdom, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “IA86”).

 Upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities and execution against the company’s assets are stayed and the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company is suspended. Any such stay and suspension does not affect any right to take any steps to enforce security over the company’s property or of a creditor to set off its claim against a claim of the company, provided that such right would have been exercisable if the company had been made the subject of a winding-up order under the IA86.

 Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or non-main, where necessary to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation, staying the commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, staying execution against the company’s assets, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities entrusting the administration or realisation of all or part of the company’s assets located in the United Kingdom to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court, extending relief of a provisional nature previously granted and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder under the law of the United Kingdom, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the IA86.

 In addition, upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative has standing to make an application to the court for an order under or in connection with sections 238, 239, 244, 245 and 423 of the IA86 (see below at “—Antecedent Transaction Laws”). For such purpose, certain time periods and notice periods specified in such sections shall be determined by reference to the date of the opening of the foreign proceeding or the date on which a person has notice of the opening of the relevant foreign proceedings as provided in the Model Law Regulations. Where such an application is made, then those sections (together with ancillary sections of the IA86 relating thereto) shall apply whether or not the company is being wound-up or is in administration under British insolvency law.

 The Insolvency Test

 The IA86 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the IA86, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

 Administration

 A company can enter into administration if the company: (i) is registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) is incorporated in an EEA State; or (iii) is not incorporated in an EEA State but has its centre of main interests (as defined in the IA86) in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK. 

 137


-----

###### There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court followed by a court order for administration (the ‘in-court route’); or (ii) the filing of certain prescribed forms with the court following which the administration takes effect (the ‘out-of-court route’). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see further below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

 A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

 When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts (see “— The Insolvency test” above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need to consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective is not reasonably practicable and similarly for the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern (the “first objective”); (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration (the “second objective”); or (iii) to realise property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see “—Statutory order of priorities” below) (the “third objective”).

 An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration. The moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed, no resolution can be passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited circumstances, no order be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”) (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims). During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

 An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security. The permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed charge assets, such permission will only be granted if disposing of the property in question is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and the net proceeds of sale are applied towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “— Antecedent Transaction Laws” below in respect of the latter).

 An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have the power to disclaim contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt—see “—Statutory order of priorities” below). Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (including administration) will generally be suspended for the duration of the relevant insolvency procedure (see “—Supplier Contracts” below).

 QFC holder – appointing an administrator

 Section 72A(1) of the IA86 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s property may not appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections 72B to 72GA, none of which

 138


-----

###### are relevant in the context of the Transaction. The remedy for the holder of a QFC is instead to appoint an administrator (see “—Administration” above).

 Administrative receivership—where the capital market exception may be relevant

 Section 72A(1) of the IA86 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s property may not appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections 72B to 72GA.

 Pursuant to section 72B of the IA86, the first exception to this general prohibition is in the context of capital markets. There are three limbs that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for this exception: (i) the appointment is in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement; (ii) a party incurs, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50 million under the arrangement; and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment.

 Each of the above three limbs is considered further below.

 Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an arrangement is a capital market arrangement if: (i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds a capital market investment issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who issues a capital market investment; or (C) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement in connection with the issue of a capital market investment; or (D) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement who agrees to provide finance to another party; or (ii) at least one party guarantees the performance of obligations of another party; or (iii) at least one party provides security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another party; or (iv) it involves an investment of a kind described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contracts for differences (the “Regulated Activities Order”).

 Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the IA86 states that a party to an arrangement includes a party to an agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the arrangement, or is necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. We note that there is no statutory definition or case law on the meaning of the term “arrangement”, however it is clear that an arrangement can be more than just one agreement and in our view the term is apposite to describe a series of inter-related transactions.

 Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, the requirement to incur debt of at least £50 million may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be expressed wholly or partly in foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at the time when the arrangement is entered into).

 Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an investment is a capital market investment if it: (i) is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or traded or designed to be rated, listed or traded.

 To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a QFC must execute a document appointing an administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document pursuant to which the QFC was created. This appointment document must then be delivered to the proposed administrative receiver and the appointment takes effect upon receipt (provided that the administrative receiver formally accepts the appointment by the end of the next business day). There is no statutory moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the appointment of an administrative receiver.

 The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the principal and interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed (the “Secured Debt”). An administrative receiver generally has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets which derive from both the security document pursuant to which he or she was appointed and Schedule 1 of the IA86 (except insofar as this is inconsistent with the terms of that security document). In exercising such powers, an administrative receiver acts as agent of the company, unless and until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver can only dispose of assets which are subject to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is satisfied that the disposal (with or without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation of the company’s property than would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and any difference between those and the open market value are paid to the holder of that security. Further, unlike an administrator, an administrative receiver’s powers do not extend to bringing actions against the directors or former directors or (except in very limited circumstances) seeking to set aside certain transactions.

 139


-----

###### Assets coming into the hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (as to the meaning of which see “—Statutory order of priorities” below).

 If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office. 

 Fixed charge receivership

 A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges – see “Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute. 

 If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

 The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which he or she is appointed, meaning he or she owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). 

 To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the prescribed part and any preferential creditors.

 Liquidation/Winding-Up

 Liquidation proceedings may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) the debtor’s centre of main interest is in the UK, or (iii) the debtor’s centre of main interest is in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. The English courts can also open compulsory liquidation (see below) in respect of foreign companies as unregistered companies if such foreign company has a sufficient connection to England and Wales.

 Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realised by the liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see “—Statutory order of priorities” below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

 There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”).

 Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever is necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” below in respect of the latter).

 In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or contributory of the company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.

###### Compulsory liquidation

 Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor or one of the other parties set out in section 124 of the IA86 (including the company itself or the directors of the company collectively) petitions for the winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which entitle the court to make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the IA86. The most common grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts (see “—The Insolvency Test” above for the meaning of this term); and (ii) it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

 From 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 (the Relevant Period) a creditor may not present a petition under section 124 for the winding up of a registered company on the ground specified in section 122(1)(f), namely that the company is unable to pay its debts, unless certain conditions are met. These are the following:

 • Condition A: the creditor is owed a debt by the company whose amount is liquidated, which has fallen due for payment, and which is not an excluded debt. “Excluded debt” is defined as a debt in respect of rent, or any sum or other payment that a tenant is liable to pay, under a relevant business tenancy and which is unpaid by reason of a financial effect of coronavirus;

 • Condition B: the creditor has delivered written notice to the company containing certain prescribed information including a statement that the creditor is seeking the company’s proposals for the payment of the debt and a statement that if no proposal to the creditor’s satisfaction is made within the period of 21 days beginning with the date on which the notice is delivered, the creditor intends to present a petition to the court for the winding-up of the company;

 • Condition C: at end of the period of 21 days beginning with the day on which condition B was met the company has not made a proposal for the payment of the debt that is to the creditor’s satisfaction; and

 • Condition D: where the petition is presented by one creditor, the sum of the debts (or the debt, if there is only one) owed by the company to that creditor in respect of which conditions A to C are met is £10,000 or more, and where the petition is presented by more than one creditor, the sum of the debts owed by the company to the creditors in respect of which conditions A to C are met is £10,000 or more.

 A creditor may apply to court for an order to disapply Conditions B and C or to shorten the time period of 21 days.

 Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the ‘commencement of a winding up’ unless the court orders otherwise. Subject to certain exceptions, if a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced on the date on which the winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect, meaning that any of the specified transactions carried out after the presentation of a winding up petition will be void if a winding up order is subsequently made unless the company (or an interested party) has first obtained a validation order from the court. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms.

 Further, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the company or its property except with the permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. 

 Members’ voluntary liquidation

 A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

 Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the majority of the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

 141


-----

###### Creditors’ voluntary liquidation

 A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders passing a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to a MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent) and, after the shareholders’ meeting, the creditors’ must also resolve to place the company into liquidation. If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail unless any director, member or creditor of the company successfully applies to the court for an order otherwise.

 Restructuring procedures 

 As well as formal insolvency proceedings, there are various restructuring tools under the laws of England which an entity may be subject to. Some of these processes are under the Companies Act 2006 (e.g. a scheme of arrangement and a restructuring plan) and some under the IA86 (e.g. a company voluntary arrangement). Further details on these processes are set out below

 Schemes of arrangement

 Pursuant to Part 26 of the CA 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company is liable to be wound-up under the IA86; and in the context of a foreign company, all that is required is a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In practice, the sufficient connection test has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s centre of main interest is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

 Recognition of an English scheme (commenced after 31 December 2020) in an EU member state will, in part, be dependent on the relevant country’s private internal law rules. Where a contract is English law governed, Regulation (EC) 593/2008 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome I) continues to apply following the UK’s exit from the EU. 

 Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75% or more by value and over 50% in number of those creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) of each class vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

 Restructuring plan

 Pursuant to Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or arrangement (a “Restructuring Plan”) proposed between a company and its creditors (or any class of them) or its members (or any class of them) in circumstances where the company has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern. The purpose of the Restructuring Plan is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial difficulties. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, a sufficient connection to England and Wales is required.

 For a consensual plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favour) to be capable of being sanctioned by the court, the Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or shareholders in each class present in person or by proxy and voting at each meeting convened to consider the Restructuring Plan (there is no majority by number test as is the case with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also apply to the court to exclude a class from voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company. Unlike a scheme, if the Restructuring Plan is not approved by a number representing at least 75 per cent. in value of any class of creditors or members of the company present in person or by proxy and voting at the relevant plan meeting (the Dissenting Class), the Dissenting Class may be crammed down provided that: (i) the court is satisfied that no members of the Dissenting Class would be worse off under the Restructuring Plan than

 142


-----

###### they would be in the most likely alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned (the ‘relevant alternative’); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan is agreed by 75% by value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) members who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the relevant alternative. Even if the voting threshold is met, the court has discretion as to whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan if it is not ‘just and equitable’. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it will be binding on all affected parties, including those who did not participate in the vote on the Restructuring Plan and those who voted against the Restructuring Plan.

 Restructuring moratorium

 Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, a free-standing moratorium is available to protect certain companies, both UK and overseas if there is a sufficient connection with England, from creditor action for a specified period, granting a ‘payment holiday’ for ‘pre-moratorium debts’. Pre-moratorium debts are debts due prior to the moratorium coming into force or debts which become due during the moratorium if they relate to obligations incurred before the moratorium comes into force. The moratorium is similar in scope to that which applies in administration, preventing security enforcement and legal proceedings amongst other things. The moratorium is available for a limited initial period of 20 business days, subject to permitted extensions. Any extension beyond 40 business days will require the consent of the company’s pre-moratorium creditors (among other conditions) or the consent of the court. In order to be eligible for the moratorium a company must be or be likely to be unable to pay its debts and the moratorium must be likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. The moratorium will be overseen by a licensed insolvency practitioner who will act as a monitor. The monitor will scrutinise the company for the duration of the moratorium, assessing whether it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. However, there are broad exclusions including for companies which are party to a capital markets arrangement.

 Company voluntary arrangements

 Pursuant to Part I of the IA86, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

 A company is eligible to propose a company voluntary arrangement proposal if it is: (a) a company registered under the CA 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland; (b) a company incorporated in an EEA State, or (c) a company not incorporated in an EEA State but having its centre of main interests in a member state other than Denmark. 

 In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, a majority (by value) of the company’s members and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

 Supplier contracts

 One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is that it can trigger termination or other consequences under supplier contracts. This makes the company vulnerable to ransom creditors. New provisions have been introduced by Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 in order to supplement the existing essential supplier regime (see below) to help the continuation of supply of goods and services to companies in an insolvency process. 

 Essential suppliers

 The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the IA86 (i) prevents the suppliers from, where a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including administration, liquidation and CVA) and a request is made by or with the concurrence of the insolvency officerholder for the giving, after the date that insolvency procedure commenced or the CVA took effect (as applicable), of any essential supplies, making it a condition of the giving of the supply, or doing anything which has the effect of making it a condition of the giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in respect of a supply given to the company before the effective date are paid; and (ii) where a company enters administration or a CVA takes effect, subject to certain exceptions, compels continued supply by restricting the effect of existing insolvency-related terms in contracts for the supply of essential goods or services.

 143


-----

###### Essential goods and services include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi and chip-and-pin devices.

 Other suppliers

 Section 233B of the IA86 says that (subject to certain exceptions), if a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including the new moratorium, CVA, administration and liquidation or where a court order is made summoning a meeting relating to a restructuring plan), (i) any provision of a supply contract which provides that the contract or supply would terminate, or any other thing would take place, or that the supplier would be entitled to terminate the contract or the supply or do any other thing (for example, change payment or supply terms) because the company becomes subject to the relevant insolvency procedure, will cease to have effect; (ii) suppliers will be unable to exercise any entitlement arising before the start of the insolvency period to terminate the contract or the supply because of an event occurring before the start of the insolvency period, for the duration of the insolvency period (which in some cases could be measured in years) and (iii) suppliers will be unable to impose ransoms by demanding payment of outstanding amounts in respect of pre-commencement supply as a condition of continuing supply.

 The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts. Certain contracts involving financial services are excluded from the regime, including a capital market arrangement. In addition, certain types of entities (such as banks or insurance companies), whether such entities are the customer or the supplier, are excluded from this regime. Additionally, the regime does not apply to insolvency-related terms of a contract for the supply of essential goods or services which cease to have effect under section 233A of the IA86 (as described above).

 Suppliers may still terminate contracts if: (i) they receive consent from the company or insolvency officeholder (where in office); or (ii) the court is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship and grants permission for the termination of the contract. Supplier rights relating to events arising after the insolvency process begins are not affected. 

 Statutory order of priorities

 A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with a set statutory order of priority when he or she distributes the proceeds of realised assets to a company’s creditors and, with the exception of the prescribed part (as described below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. This statutory order of priority is broadly summarised as follows:

 (a) proceeds of realisations from assets subject to a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realisation); 

 (b) any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver and moratorium debts and certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” in circumstances where a company has entered into a restructuring moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation within 12 weeks beginning with the day after the end of the moratorium; 

 (c) expenses of the liquidation or the administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the administrator or liquidator, or any necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process;

 (d) ordinary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), which include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person, holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to the statutory limit; 

 (e) secondary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), including bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the statutory limit, deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would otherwise have been eligible for FSCS compensation and claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers; 

 (f) subject to certain exceptions, the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money that the administrator or liquidator must set aside from realisations from floating charge assets to distribute to unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realisations, and unless the

 144


-----

###### cost of making the prescribed part available to unsecured creditors would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors) – calculated as 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net realisations and 20 per cent. of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000); 

 (g) proceeds of floating charge asset realisations (less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part), according to the priority of the security; 

 (h) provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings (to pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the prescribed part unless the prescribed part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors);

 (i) statutory interest that arises on debts after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8 per cent. per annum); and

 (j) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

 Any surplus following the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There are no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

 Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.

 Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

 Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company).

 Foreign Currency Risk

 In administration or liquidation, any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling must be converted into pounds sterling at a single rate for each currency as determined by the administrator or liquidator by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the date that the company went into administration or liquidation. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. 

 Post-petition interest

 Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes or any Guarantee to which an English company is a party (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the English company’s insolvency proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the commencement of those proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries.

 145


-----

###### Trust Assets

 Assets held on trust by the company for a third party generally fall outside the insolvent estate that is available for distribution.

 Antecedent Transaction Laws

 There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

 These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which applies regardless of whether the company is in insolvency proceedings. The granting of security or guarantees by a company could be subject to challenge under these provisions.

 Transactions at an undervalue

 If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the “SBEEA”) introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any transaction under section 238 of the IA86. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the Model Law Regulations, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction at an undervalue.

 A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (2 years before the onset of insolvency, being broadly the commencement of its liquidation or administration); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86 (although there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the transaction is made to a person connected to the company such as a shareholder or a director (a “connected person”)).

 The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.

 If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the IA86, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such proceedings.

 Preferences

 If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the SBEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any preference claim under section 239 of the IA86. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the Model Law Regulations, he or she also has standing to bring a preference claim.

 A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than that person would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (6 months

 146


-----

###### before the onset of the insolvency or 2 years before the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86.

 If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given. However, for the court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

 The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC Bacon [1990] BCLC 324).

 Voidable floating charges

 A floating charge created by a company over its property may be invalid if it was created in the relevant time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of 2 years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset on insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

 This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. This means that a floating charge can be partly invalid to the extent that it is provided for past consideration. No court action is required save for where there is a foreign officeholder recognised under the Model Law Regulations who wishes to attack the floating charge under article 23 of the Model Law Regulations.

 In practical terms, a floating charge will therefore only be invalid to the extent that it is given in exchange for prior consideration (e.g. to secure loans previously made) and any floating charge provided to, amongst other matters, secure new debt provided at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, will not be invalid under section 245 of the IA86.

 Section 245 of the IA86 does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

 The requirement for the company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to above, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in reduction/discharge in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent.

 Transactions defrauding creditors

 A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside by the court if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing that person’s interests in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make.

 It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder and can be made by, subject to certain conditions, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The victim of the transaction can apply to court himself or herself to set aside a transaction. A foreign officeholder recognised under the Model Law

###### Regulations also has standing to apply to court. The IA86 also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods). The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

 If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

 Extortionate credit transactions

 If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder or a foreign officeholder recognised under the Model Law Regulations, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the SBEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any extortionate credit transaction claim under section 244 of the IA86.

 A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

 The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences).

 Orders

 In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into.

 Fixed and floating charges

 There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (i) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets into cash and use that cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder (see “— Statutory order of priorities” above); (ii) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the secured assets; (iii) general costs and expenses (including a liquidator’s or an administrator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding up or an administration (as applicable) are payable out of the charging company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of a floating charge) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder (see “—Statutory order of priorities” above); (iv) until the floating charge security crystallises, the charging company is entitled to deal with the assets that are subject to the floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that those assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge, and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over those assets in priority to the floating charge security; (v) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to a certain additional challenge under English insolvency law (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws—Voidable floating charges” above); and (vi) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors and also to ring-fencing (in respect of each of which see “—Statutory order of priorities” above). This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests.

 Under English law, there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document as floating charge security; the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests that are labelled as fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests, rather than held to be floating security interests, will depend on, among other things, whether the charge holder

 148


-----

###### has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the secured assets and their proceeds and, if so, whether that control is exercised by the charge holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the course of its business without the consent of the charge holder, a court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, whatever its other characteristics, notwithstanding that in the security document the security interest may be expressed in words that indicate an intention to create a fixed security interest.

 An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realisations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 where the first ranking floating charge was created on or after 6 April 2020 (£600,000 if created before then).

 There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail above) following the granting of the guarantee or security.

 Secondary Legislation

 UK secondary legislation, such as the Financial Collateral Regulations, may be invalid and ineffective if, among other things, it is not enacted within the scope of the relevant primary statute or within the powers of the relevant rule-making authorities.

 Filings

 The prescribed particulars in respect of a security document under which an English company purports to create security, together with a certified copy of the security document, should be delivered to the Registrar of Companies within 21 days after the date of the security document in accordance with Chapter A1 of Part 25 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “CA06”). Failing this, the security created by the security document will (subject as mentioned in the above Chapter) be void against a liquidator or administrator and any creditor of the charging company. The application of the above Chapter to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Regulations. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out in section 859A(6) of the CA06): (i) a charge in favour of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of the CA06 by or under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking Act 2009). Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities. In some cases, such as the registration regime under the CA06, the priority of security interests which are registrable and have been duly registered follows chronological order of creation (subject to certain exceptions— see, for example, and without limitation, the exceptions under “—Assignments” below). In other cases, priority in respect of security interests over certain types of asset depends on the time at which those security interests are registered in a particular asset register. Thus, for instance, the priority of security interests over ships and aircraft are governed by their respective dates of registration in the appropriate register, whether or not the relevant secured party had notice of an earlier unregistered security interest over the relevant asset. Similar rules apply in relation to security interests over registered land and certain intellectual property rights, such as patents.

 Corporate authorisations and maintenance of capital

 The legality, validity and enforceability of the obligations of Security Interests are subject to matters affecting companies generally, including that: (i) its entry into and performance of such obligations: (A) are not prohibited by its constitutional documents (or contracts to which it is party); and (B) have been duly authorised and do not breach or result in inconsistency with applicable laws or regulations; and (ii) the documents evidencing such obligations have been duly executed and delivered in accordance with all applicable procedures and laws. In addition, the granting of guarantees or security by an English company could be subject to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

 149


-----

###### Enforcement

 Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including guarantees and security).

 Wrongful Trading

 If, in the course of an insolvent winding up or insolvent administration of a company, it appears that a person who is, or was, a director of the company knew or ought to have concluded at some point before the commencement of the liquidation or administration that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation or insolvent administration, the liquidator or administrator of the company can seek a court declaration that the director make a contribution to the company’s assets pursuant to the IA86.

 Financial assistance

 A liability (an “Acquisition Liability”) incurred directly or indirectly for the purpose of an acquisition by any person of shares in an English company or in any holding company (within the meaning contained in section 1159 of the CA06) of that company, or the discharge or reduction of any Acquisition Liability or any liability incurred for the purpose of refinancing any liability that from time to time, directly or indirectly, refinances any such liability, could be subject to challenge if that incurrence, discharge or reduction is unlawful under section 678 or 679 of the CA06. These provisions apply to financial assistance (for example, guarantees or security) granted in connection with an acquisition of shares in an English company, if the English company providing the assistance is either a public company the shares in which are being acquired, a public or private company that is a subsidiary of the public company the shares in which are being acquired, or a public company that is a subsidiary of a private company the shares in which are being acquired.

 Assignments

 Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including, without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The first person to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest.

 Share mortgages

 A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if the relevant transfers of shares are registered, although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest.

 “People with significant control” regime

 Pursuant to Part 21A of the CA06 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the CA06), from 6 April 2016 certain UK incorporated companies, societates europaeae registered in the UK and limited liability partnerships formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a “relevant company”) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the CA06 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a “notifying party”) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to the CA06. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the CA06, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of the Security Interests and the ability of the relevant secured parties to enforce their rights under or in respect of the Security Interests.

-----

###### Application of proceeds

 The enforceability of a provision in a security document that relates to the application of proceeds will be subject to any obligations mandatorily preferred by applicable law.

 Turnover trust

 A turnover trust may be construed as creating a registrable charge under section 859A of the CA06, in which case it will be void in the circumstances set out in section 859H of the CA06, unless the prescribed statement of particulars, together with a certified copy of the agreement or instrument under which the turnover trust arises, are delivered to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with section 859A of the CA06 within 21 days after the date of creation of that charge (see “—Filings” above) (unless an order allowing an extended period is made under section 859F of the CA06).

 Ranking

 The description given by the parties to the ranking of security interests is not determinative of the ranking of those security interests.

 Foreign laws

 If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English law, the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

 Third party rights

 Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

 Amendments

 An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

 Fetters on exercise of powers

 A provision under which a company or other legal person agrees, or purports to agree, to fetter the exercise of its powers under its constitutional documents or any applicable law (or regulation) may not be enforceable against the company or other legal person.

 Account Bank’s right to set off

 With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by the Issuer, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with the Issuer. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.

 The Additional Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may only be sold outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors”.

 The Additional Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By accepting delivery of this Offering Memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or indirectly, any Additional Note to the public.

 EEA and United Kingdom

 The Additional Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU ("Insurance Distribution Directive"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

 The Additional Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK.

 France. The Additional Notes may only be offered or sold in France to qualified investors (“investisseurs qualifiés”), as defined in Article L. 411-2 1° of the French Code monétaire et financier and this Offering Memorandum, and any offering or marketing materials relating to the Additional Notes must also only be made available or distributed in France to qualified investors (“investisseurs qualifies”), as defined in Article L. 411-2 1° of the French Code monétaire et financier. Prospective investors are informed that this Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be submitted for clearance to the AMF.

 (d) in connection with offers or sales of Additional Notes, it has only issued or passed on, and will only issue or pass on, any document received by it in connection with the issue of the Additional Notes to persons who are persons to whom the documents may otherwise lawfully be issued or passed on.

 New Issue of Securities

 The Additional Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the Additional Notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for inclusion of the Additional Notes on any automated dealer quotation system.

 The Original Notes have been listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the the Global Exchange Market. The Issuer has applied, through its listing agent, to list the Additional Notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and trade the Additional Notes on the Global Exchange Market; however, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Additional Notes will be approved for listing or such listing will be maintained. The Issuer cannot assure you that the prices at which the Additional Notes will sell in the market after this Offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Additional Notes will continue after this Offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Additional Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Additional Notes at any time without notice. In addition, market- making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Additional Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favourable.

 No Sales of Similar Securities

 The Issuer has agreed that they will not during the period from the date of this Offering Memorandum and including the date that is 90 days after such date, without first obtaining the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer and having a tenor more than one year.

 Price Stabilisation and Short Positions

 In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) may engage in transactions that stabilise the market price of the Additional Notes. Such transactions consist of bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain the price of the Additional Notes. Purchases of a security to stabilise the price or to reduce a short position may cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases.

 In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Additional Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Additional Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing the Additional Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Additional Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering.

 Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Additional Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Additional Notes. As a result, the price of the Additional Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

 None of the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Additional Notes. In addition, none of the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

 Any stabilising action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Additional Notes Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

###### Other Relationships

 The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and/or may in the future engage in, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking and/or other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Issuer or its affiliates. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer’s affiliates (including the Notes). As an example, some or all of the Initial Purchasers (including each of BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE and Société Générale and their respective affiliates) hold certain securities in respect of debt financing of the Group (including debt securities issued by CLEF) and have entered into certain hedging transactions with members of the Group and/or CLEF in connection with such debt financing. Furthermore, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its subsidiaries may routinely hedge their credit exposure to these entities consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Accordingly, the Additional Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

 The term “United States” is used with the meaning given to it in Regulation S.

 By your acceptance thereof, you will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

**1.1** **THE GROUP’S PROFILE, STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE**

**1.1.1** **GETLINK TODAY**

Initially the promoter of the Tunnel, which is a historic and technological feat, the Group has transformed itself using
opportunities stemming from new demands for mobility.

The Group was created in 1986 with the signing of the Concession Agreement, which awarded the construction, financing
and operation of the Channel Tunnel to the Franco-British consortium of France Manche SA and The Channel Tunnel Group
Limited. The operation of the Tunnel started in 1994 and for more than 25 years it has fundamentally changed the way trade
takes place between the United Kingdom and continental Europe by enabling the development of new integrated crossborder logistics chains as well as access to new markets.

Since the Tunnel was brought into service, the Group has continually evolved. In 2018, the Group changed its name to
“Getlink”. This name evokes the dynamism of exchanges and marks the Group’s entry into a new era of mobility
infrastructures. Much more than merely a new page in its history, this name is a true commitment to the future with the
development and management of safe, modern and environmentally-friendly mobility infrastructures.

The Group operates an extremely long Concession (until 2086) which is built around an integrated rail system beneath the
sea enabling:

**The Eurotunnel segment’s cross-Channel services which in 2020 represented 85% of the Group’s revenue**

Eurotunnel firstly offers a transport service between Calais in France and Folkestone in the United Kingdom aboard Shuttles.
The Truck Shuttles transport heavy goods vehicles, while the Passenger Shuttles transport passengers in vehicles (cars,
coaches, motorbikes and motor homes). The Shuttle Services are in direct competition with ferry services and compete
indirectly with airlines, as set out in section 1.2.1.c of this Universal Registration Document. In 2020, the Group’s Shuttle
Services generated 64% of its total revenue.

Eurotunnel secondly makes its infrastructure available for rail operators to provide rail links between continental Europe and
the United Kingdom. Eurostar operates high-speed, end-to-end passenger services with no transfers needed between
London and Paris, Brussels and more recently Amsterdam. Rail freight companies operate their rail freight trains subject to
a regulated tariff framework. Eurotunnel does not operate these services but manages their passage through the Fixed Link
Railway Network in return for payment of a toll. In 2020, the Group earned 20% of its revenue from the use of the Tunnel
Railway Network by the Railway Companies’ High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services.

These services operate in the transport market between continental Europe and the United Kingdom and are described in
section 1.2 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Other types of services which in 2020 represented 15% of the Group’s revenue**

Since 2010, the Group has been diversifying its activities beyond its Eurotunnel segment:

with its Europorte segment which is involved in the entire rail freight transport logistics chain mostly in France as
described in section 1.3 of this Universal Registration Document; and

with its ElecLink segment project of the future 1GW electricity interconnector between the United Kingdom and France
as described in section 1.4 of this Universal Registration Document.

     - Restated at the rate of exchange used for the 2020 income statement (£1=€1.126).

**1.1.2** **RESILIENCE AND AGILITY IN AN UNPRECEDENTED YEAR**

The Covid-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on the transport sector in 2020. In addition, people and organisations
involved in cross-border trade and other exchanges have also been faced with the uncertainties surrounding the end of the
Brexit Transition Period on 31 December 2020. The Group put arrangements in place well in advance; however, it has had to
react fast and decisively to the ever-changing evolutions of the pandemic and to the measures put in place by governments.
The robustness of the Group’s business model and its strict operational and financial discipline have paid off and have
enabled Getlink to demonstrate its resilience despite the exceptionally difficult environment in 2020.

**Covid-19 pandemic**

In December 2019 the emergence of a new coronavirus strain (Covid-19) was reported in China that has subsequently spread
across the world, including Europe. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak as a
pandemic. To combat the Covid-19 pandemic, governments and companies around the world have imposed a succession
of lockdowns, travel restrictions, quarantines and other restrictive measures. These measures, as well as a dramatic reduction
in consumer spending, have had a material negative impact on the world’s economy.

Faced with the rapid spread of Covid-19 and this unprecedented situation, Getlink's priority has been to protect people and
adapt its activities to ensure the Group's sustainability. From February 2020, with the support of general management and
the whole Board of Directors, Getlink took steps to reconcile two priorities: in the first instance to reduce the health risk and
preserve the health of teams, customers and partners, but also to ensure the continuity of operations and the movement of
goods and people, while preserving the Group's liquidity and sustainability.

The Group, which remained resilient throughout the 2020 financial year, has demonstrated its agility and ability to alter its
level of activity, while controlling costs and managing its cash flow, thanks to the exceptional commitment of its teams.

Getlink did not seek financial support from the French government in terms of loans, public guarantees nor delayed tax
payments. Through concerted action, carried out with the support of employees who contributed through their efforts,
whether in terms of short-time working, furlough, or forgoing remuneration, the company has sought to preserve
employment.

In March, the Group implemented measures designed to maintain and strengthen its cash position and maintain compliance
with its financial covenant ratios:

cancellation in the first half of 2020 of the payment of the 2019 dividend; and

the Shield Plan aimed at achieving substantial savings in operating expenses compared with 2019 and at optimising
capital expenditure in order to reduce cash outflows, all while preserving safety and maintenance investments.

In October 2020, Getlink refinanced its 2023 Green Bonds by issuing new "green" Senior Secured Notes in the form of the
2025 Green Bonds, raising an additional €126 million in cash.


-----

The Group took care to ensure compliance with its financial covenants, especially those applicable to Eurotunnel's activities:

as a precautionary measure, entry into agreement for a waiver, to be used if necessary, on the main Eurotunnel covenant
(DSCR) as presented in notes A.1 and G.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in section 2.2.1 of this
Universal Registration Document;

heightened monitoring of cash outflows and intentionally prudent management of intra-group cash flows; and

strengthening of the Capex Reserve Account, the investment account provided for in the financing agreements for the
Eurotunnel Term Loan, of €35 million (with no impact at consolidated level for the Group), which allows the capital
expenditure required to maintain and operate the Fixed Link infrastructure during the first half of 2021 to be financed in
accordance with the applicable agreements.

These measures and the impact of the pandemic on the Group’s financial results and financial situation can be found in
section 1.2.2 and chapter 2, in particular in section 2.1 and notes A.1 and D.9 of section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration
Document.

**Brexit**

The United Kingdom’s referendum decision of 23 June 2016 to leave the European Union opened a period of uncertainty.
Initially scheduled for 29 March 2019, the United Kingdom’s exit was pushed back three times and finally occurred on
31 January 2020. A Withdrawal Agreement on a negotiated exit was entered into between the United Kingdom and the
European Union on 17 October 2019. The Withdrawal Agreement, designed to allow the future relationship with the United
Kingdom to be negotiated, provided for an 11-month transition period (“Transition Period”) which ended on 31 December
2020. Eurotunnel used this time to work in liaison with the authorities to set up a smart border, which aims to maintain a
smooth flow of traffic between the European Union and the United Kingdom by moving to online and automated
transmission of declarations.

On 24 December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union announced that they had reached a post-Brexit
agreement on trade and cooperation. Effective from 1 January 2021, this agreement sets out the rules applicable to the
relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in a number of areas. In particular, the trade agreement
provides for broad exemptions from customs duties and quotas by application of rules of origin that aim to simplify and
encourage trade in goods where these products have been for the most part (with certain exceptions) manufactured from
raw materials or components originating in the European Union and/or the United Kingdom. The agreement also defines a
privileged relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, not only in trade matters, but also for
cooperation in other areas such as police and judicial cooperation, social security coordination and transport. Customs
formalities, as well as health and phytosanitary controls have been reinstated for the transport of goods since 1 January
2021. However, to ease the transition, the UK government is applying the new requirements for imports from the European
Union in a phased manner[1]. The free movement of people is no longer applicable and immigration controls to and from the
United Kingdom have also been reinstated.

1 On 11 March 2021, the UK government announced a revised timetable for the introduction of additional controls which delays their
application to 1 October 2021, 1 January 2022 or March 2022 depending on the category.

**1.1.3** **BUSINESS MODEL**

Notwithstanding the current specific circumstances, Getlink remains a major player in mobility infrastructure, international
trade and a leader in eco-responsible transport. Getlink is committed on a daily basis to facilitating trade, supporting
economic activity between the United Kingdom and continental Europe and creating value for all its stakeholders, by bringing
people, business and cultures together. Capitalising on the Group’s expertise and rail infrastructure for more than 25 years,
Getlink groups together the activities of four complementary commercial brands.


-----

**Vital cross-Channel link**

Since its creation, the Group’s purpose has been to bring people, companies and cultures together. The Tunnel, the Group’s
historic core business, is a vital link between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. In 2019, the reference year, it
enabled 21 million passengers, 2.6 million cars and 1.6 million trucks to cross the Short Straits between France and the United
Kingdom. The Tunnel enables safe and speedy transportation 365 days a year and 24 hours a day. More than a quarter of
exports from the United Kingdom to the EU and more than a fifth of imports from the EU to the United Kingdom depend
on the speed and reliability of the Tunnel[2], supporting approximately 220,000 jobs in the United Kingdom[3].

Looking to the future, the Group is the market leader in the Short Straits transport market. The Group has constantly
transformed and diversified to meet the challenges of new forms of mobility.

**A resilient core and diversified complementary activities**

The Tunnel is unique in the world and represents the foundation stone of the Group’s business model. Alongside the
Eurotunnel segment (which manages the Tunnel infrastructure, holds a long-term concession and operates rail transport),
Getlink has successfully expanded its core business into several other areas: Europorte, the leading private rail freight
operator in France, a promising market given increasing environmental restrictions; ElecLink, the future electrical
interconnector between Great Britain and France and a future growth driver for the Group; and CIFFCO, the leading private
rail training centre in France.

**Assets that stand out in a changing market: safe, green, smart and premium**

Eurotunnel offers all its customers a smart, green, safe and premium service.

**Safe, since the Tunnel has always been the safest way to travel between the United Kingdom and continental Europe, both**
for passengers and freight. Moreover, in a context of disruption and a public health crisis, Eurotunnel Le Shuttle enables its
passenger customers to travel in their own vehicles and without any contact with the outside world, thanks to the
development of digital controls and proven health protocols. Eurotunnel and in particular its Shuttle Services were certified
on 23 February 2021 by AFNOR (the French standards authority) following verification of the Covid-19 health-protection
measures implemented with the maximum score of 100% as detailed in section 6.5.3 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Green, because Getlink manages some of the most environmentally-friendly mobility solutions and infrastructures. Carbon**
emissions generated by the rail freight transported by Truck Shuttles are 12 times lower than transport by sea (ferry) and 73
times lower than transport by sea for the transport of passengers in Eurotunnel’s Shuttles. With regard to Eurostar, one
passenger journey emits 70 times less than a journey by plane[4].

Fully invested in the digital revolution, the Group explores all the benefits of digital technology to offer its customers a nocontact service that is increasingly Smart and Premium commercial offers that are customised and adapted to consumer
expectations.

**Creating value for all stakeholders**

As the Concession operator until 2086, the Group benefits from the length of the Concession’s long-term revenue stream as
well as a creator of sustainable value for all its stakeholders: customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, local economic
players and inhabitants of the regions served. First and foremost, the Group stands out for its corporate culture founded on
ethics, collective commitment and the importance placed on the customer. Getlink also enjoys a firm foothold in the areas
of Calais (France) and Kent (England), two regions that it helps to promote, Eurotunnel having helped revitalise employment,
notably with the creation of an historic estimate of 8,000 direct and indirect jobs[5] since the Tunnel entered service. Through
its rail transport business, the Group participates in regional development, while rail freight offers a means to reduce road
congestion and decrease the environmental footprint of transport activities. Reliable and fast, the Channel Tunnel Fixed Link
plays a decisive role in the development of e-commerce and the new economy. In addition, by securing electricity supply for
households and the European power grid, ElecLink will serve the general interest with minimal impact on the environment.

**1.1.4** **GROUP STRATEGY**

Getlink is a high-performing company, with a business model that has demonstrated its resilience in 2020. The Group intends
to continue to focus on an increasingly connected, innovative, environmentally-friendly and collaborative model, serving
sustainable growth and value creation for all stakeholders.

Capitalising on a solid core business, the Group will continue its controlled diversification strategy towards high-potential
activities, spurred by growing needs that are essential to economic development: mobility of individuals, goods transport
and energy transition.

**Anticipation and adaptation of services to the Brexit context**

Eurotunnel has worked to develop and implement innovative solutions in order to maintain the fluidity of border crossings.
For its Truck Shuttle Service, Eurotunnel has designed, in collaboration with the French customs authorities, a smart border
system called the Eurotunnel Border Pass to maintain the fluidity of border crossings. This system allows the carrier to provide
the documents required by French Customs before boarding, namely at the point of registering the journey in the Eurotunnel
information system. When the driver arrives at the Eurotunnel terminal, the information already collected is transmitted in
real time to the French Customs information system, which can then decide on any exit checks that may be required on the
French side.

This new service, provided by Eurotunnel to meet the needs of Brexit, represents a major differentiating asset.

**Profitability and dynamics of transformation in the context of impact on demand and supply of mobility**

Despite the brutal impact of the Covid-19 crisis and the associated travel restrictions on mobility, the events of 2020 have
highlighted the essential nature and inestimable value of Getlink's businesses. The mission of public transport service has
never been more meaningful. In the face of the pandemic, the Truck Shuttle Service made it possible to maintain supplies to
the United Kingdom and, from March onwards, Europorte was able to contribute to the hydroalcoholic gel production chain
by transporting 250,000 tonnes of raw materials.

In addition, Getlink has sought to find the best balance between costs and profitability, while at the same time preserving
its ability to invest in its future.

Getlink has structured its performance plan in two parts:

The 2020-2021 Shield Plan: a cost-cutting plan to deal with the public health crisis, based essentially on short-term
measures to limit expenditure and cash outflows to the strict minimum, to freeze recruitment and make use of shorttime working and furlough schemes, whilst maintaining safety- and maintenance-related expenditure and investment.
This strict cost discipline will be maintained in 2021, with clear and targeted investment decisions.

The WAYforward business project: for the years 2021-2025, an ambitious plan to strengthen the Group's leadership over
its businesses. In 2020, executive management and the Board of Directors launched a major programme consisting of 16
structural transformation projects (including lean management and digital projects), with a clear objective: to change the
organisation of certain functions and the Group's working methods in order to improve performance and relevance. The
three pillars of this plan are customer knowledge and satisfaction, operational and commercial excellence and the quality
of the Group's teams.

General management and the Board of Directors have established the generation of long-term value for all stakeholders as
their founding principle. Getlink gives substance to this objective through its performance plan. The continuous improvement
of its practices, both to adapt them to the needs of its customers - evolving in the context of the public health crisis and
Brexit - and to improve their efficiency, aims to generate savings year on year and fuel the Group's investments and growth.

**Fundamentals and strategic levers**

In an environment that contains many challenges, Getlink continues to have strong assets to pursue sustainable and
profitable growth based on its strategic priorities

By its nature, Getlink, together with the Concession, is at the very heart of the changes facing passenger and goods transport.
It offers an alternative to other possible means of transport such as planes and ferries, which is both fast and more
environmentally-friendly. This also implies continuing to meet the challenge of several major emerging phenomena: the
evolution of mobility practices, the digitalisation of the economy and of the customer relationship, particularly in the specific
context of the public health crisis, Brexit and the evolution of the economy towards a low-carbon model.

All Getlink's initiatives to move towards a reinforced low carbon strategy, including targeted investments and continuous
reinforcement of team skills, will contribute to value creation in the coming years. This ambition has been at the heart of
Getlink's mission since 1987 and it is as relevant today as ever before.

High-Speed Passenger Train services have development potential, which is slowed down by barriers to development such
as difficulties implementing efficient border controls, interoperability and obtaining rolling stock authorisations, which can
delay, restrict or stop the development of services to new destinations. Getlink is actively working with various stakeholders
to align the technical rules relating to the Tunnel with the Technical Standards for Interoperability (TSI). In addition, the
development of the Eurostar London-Amsterdam link illustrates the capacity of stakeholders to address the issue of border
controls.

In this context, Getlink is specifically focused on delivering its dynamic pricing policy and on making constant improvements
to its railway system, taking account of the need to anticipate and accompany new market trends to incorporate them into
a sustainable value creation strategy.


-----

Europorte, which for several years now has achieved a profitable business model, demonstrated in 2020 its ability to ensure
the rail services that are essential to economic life during the public health crisis, while once again achieving its development
and profitability objectives.

ElecLink is Getlink’s response to the development of a low-carbon economy in that it will enable the Europe-wide electricity
flows that are essential for the growth of renewable sources of energy.

Investment policy

In the volatile 2020 economic context, Getlink has been working on optimising its investments and on strengthening safety
and maintenance. Getlink combines technology with business transformation and societal challenges to create sustainable
value for all stakeholders. Getlink continues to invest in the renewal of its rolling stock and the safety of its rail infrastructure,
the core business, to increase the Group's industrial efficiency.

Getlink’s investment policy, as set out in section 1.6 of this Universal Registration Document, aims to support and amplify
the Group’s growth potential in the markets that it serves. It focuses on investments that are complementary to existing
assets, aiming to develop synergies within the Group and leverage the expertise of its teams in managing complex
infrastructures and particularly the Tunnel.

A controlled diversification of revenue streams

Alongside operating the Concession, which will remain its core business, Getlink aims to continue the controlled
diversification of its revenues by operating Europorte, its rail freight business, and by operating the ElecLink electricity
interconnector. It may also make focused acquisitions, alone or in partnership, in transport infrastructure (or related) activities
that are capable of generating synergies with current businesses while strengthening the diversification of the Group's
business portfolio and contributing to a reduction in its risk profile. Thus, Getlink plans to respond to the needs of the regions
in France by offering tailor-made and innovative passenger rail services, within the framework of a partnership with the RATP,
called Régionéo.

Key resources

Getlink is able to offer Eurotunnel’s services thanks to the initial private investment of over €20 billion (at 2019 values). This
unique rail infrastructure beneath the sea is constantly maintained and improved, such as with the modernisation of its fleet
of Truck Shuttles and the Passenger Shuttle renovation programme as set out in section 1.6.1 of this Universal Registration
Document. Over the life of the Concession period, revenue from rail tolls (a regulated activity) and the Shuttle business is
sufficient to cover the repayment of bank borrowings and remunerate equity contributed by investors via the payment of
dividends. In addition, as a listed company, Getlink SE allows investors to trade in the shares based on their own expectations
of traffic levels and fluctuations in exchange rates and borrowing rates over the remaining Concession period.

In the 2019 reference year, Eurotunnel’s revenue was close to €1 billion, with EBITDA of approximately €550 million. This
covers the maintenance and improvement of assets, debt service and shareholder remuneration.

**Human resources: the Group’s performance is only possible thanks to the 3,500 Group team members who make Getlink**
the great company that it is and their sense of service, which is apparent both on a daily basis as well as in exceptional
situations. It is thanks to team members’ determination and exemplary engagement throughout this extraordinary year
that the organisation has been able to weather 2020 with agility. Getlink is strengthening its action to diversify the profile
of team members including the implementation of its action plan on gender equality. In addition to employees, Getlink
has been working to support the needs of all local communities as closely as possible.

**Regional foothold: due to Eurotunnel’s foothold in the Kent and Calais areas, for more than 25 years the organisation**
has contributed significantly to the development of the regional economy through local sub-contractors the use of whom
represents the equivalent of a thousand jobs.

**Concession Agreement: furthermore, among the Group’s resources that contribute to its smooth running, not counting**
the Concession Agreement that provides a secure legal framework and a long-term Concession period (see section 8.2.2
of this Universal Registration Document), the Group’s financing (with the most recent developments described notably
in section 8.2.4) and its rolling stock (as set out in sections 1.2.3 and 1.2.4), the Group’s internal culture is a key resource,
whether with regard to ethics, collective commitment or the importance placed on the customer relationship.


-----

Dynamic cash flow management

Getlink manages its debt dynamically and with a view to optimising costs and improving agility. This agility was further
enhanced in 2020. The Group's debt was put in place during the 2007 financial restructuring. The successful refinancing of
part of the debt in June 2017 enabled financial costs to be optimised and the recognition by the markets of the Group's
financial solidity. In 2018, Getlink completed a new stage in its financial reorganisation with the issuance of the 2023 Green
Bonds, enabling it to further refine its structure. In 2020, Getlink refinanced these bonds with a new issue of Green Bonds, a
category of bonds issued on the market to finance environmentally-friendly projects, often as part of energy transition such
as the development of renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements and development of transport infrastructures with
low greenhouse gas emissions.

Customer satisfaction

Getlink places the customer at the heart of its strategy and implements ways to enhance their satisfaction and loyalty. It
achieves this notably by strengthening communication of real-time information and adapting services to the specific needs
of customer segments, such as owners of electric vehicles, passengers travelling with pets and customers with reduced
mobility.

CSR ambition and environmental strategy

From the outset, Getlink has defined CSR as one of its founding pillars, with its implementation described in chapter 6 of this
Universal Registration Document. The Climate Plan project is currently underway. The analysis presented in the Non-Financial
Performance Statement in chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document constitutes the first step of the environmental
strategy and allows the definition of the action programme to be implemented and gives a new scope to its ambitions.
Getlink's investment policy is also in line with its environmental and societal approach by targeting in particular less emitting
rolling stock.

In an environment marked by numerous geopolitical uncertainties, the Group has demonstrated the relevance of its business
model. True to its entrepreneurial and responsible vision, Getlink will continue to promote long-term value creation and
share this value with all its stakeholders. Getlink is convinced that its ability to connect to its ecosystem is a source of
innovation, value creation and responsible growth; it therefore favours an equitable approach to sharing value that combines
economic, financial and non-financial performance, while investing to ensure the long-term success of the Group. It intends
to consolidate its strengths across all CSR fields and expand its actions in favour of the environment and the fight against
climate change and to combine services to customers with strong action in favour of the environment.

The Tunnel contributes to the organisation of regions, the mobility of individuals and to bringing people together. Rail freight
transport helps free-up the road networks. The Tunnel’s economic footprint is discussed in detail in chapter 6 of this Universal
Registration Document, both in terms of employment and as a driver of corporate growth for business partners.

Once completed, the ElecLink interconnector is also expected to play a key societal role by enhancing the European electricity
network, optimising capacity production and securing electricity supply to consumers. Once in service, ElecLink is expected
to make a significant contribution to opening up the UK electricity market. Building on its experience in the rail sector, Getlink
controls, through its subsidiary Europorte, the leading private rail freight operator in France. With over 800 team members,
it is well positioned to bring together European independent operators in a promising market and in a context of increasing
environmental restrictions. With its subsidiary CIFFCO, the leading training centre dedicated to rail industry professions,
Getlink possesses the technical expertise necessary to accompany growth in its Eurotunnel and Europorte businesses.

Ethics is a fundamental pillar of Getlink's commitment to responsible business conduct. Getlink's governing bodies have zero
tolerance for abusive practices, such as corruption or human rights violations.

By combining its growth potential and the diversity of its businesses, the Group’s long-term strategy is to generate recurring
cash flows enabling it to share value with its stakeholders, employees, shareholders and suppliers and ensure the Group’s
development. The Group’s business model has demonstrated its relevance over the years and, despite being faced with the
unprecedented challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the Group remains extremely robust and perfectly adapted to
the challenges of the future (fast, reliable and environmentally friendly transport). In order to develop, the Group will seek
to extend synergies between its businesses and strengthen the expertise of its teams in managing complex infrastructures.
Capitalising on a solid core business, the Group will continue its controlled diversification strategy towards high-potential
activities, spurred by growing needs that are essential to economic development: mobility of individuals, goods transport
and energy transition. The Group also plans to further enhance its regional foothold on both sides of the Channel as a key
player in the Anglo-European network.

The risk factors relating to the company's activities and its environment are presented in chapter 3 of this Universal
Registration Document.

**The Getlink segment**

Getlink SE is the Group’s listed parent company.

In 2007 a new holding company, Groupe Eurotunnel SA, was set up. It was proposed to all shareholders of the former
Eurotunnel structure that they exchange their twinned shares for ordinary shares of Groupe Eurotunnel SA. This offer was
accepted by more than 93% of shareholders. In late 2007, Eurotunnel PLC and Eurotunnel SA became TNU PLC and TNU SA
respectively and were then absorbed by Groupe Eurotunnel SA in May 2009 and October 2010 respectively.

The Centre International de Formation Ferroviaire de la Côte d’Opale (CIFFCO) supplies professional training services in the
rail sector as described in section 1.5 of this Universal Registration Document.

Euro-Immo GET SAS manages and develops property assets and performs associated activities, as set out in section 1.5 of
this Universal Registration Document.

London Carex Limited is involved in a potential project for the development of rail freight in the United Kingdom, as explained
in section 1.5 of this Universal Registration Document.

The Cheriton Resources companies are finance or investment companies and are mostly inactive.

Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited is the structure that holds the G2 notes as mentioned in note G.7 to the consolidated
financial statements contained in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

Eurotunnel Developments Limited and its subsidiary Orbital Park Limited were responsible for the development of property
in the United Kingdom which was not used in connection with the operation of the System. These companies are no longer
active.

Getlink owns 50% of a joint subsidiary, Kinesis SAS. As part of the opening up of the rail market in France to competition,
the Group has set up RDGL Rail SAS, a joint subsidiary with RATP (55% RATP Dev, 45% Getlink), to offer regional passenger
rail services under the trade name Régionéo as set out in section 1.5 of this Universal Registration Document.

**The Eurotunnel segment**

Eurotunnel Holding SAS is the parent company of the Eurotunnel sub-group of which the following are the key entities:

France Manche SA (FM) and The Channel Tunnel Group Limited (CTG) operate the Tunnel as Concessionaires in accordance
with the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement as described in chapter 8 of this Universal Registration
Document. FM and CTG, whose shares are twinned, are the borrowing entities under the Term Loan described in section
8.2.4 of this Universal Registration Document.

Eurotunnel Services GIE (ESGIE) and Eurotunnel Services Limited (ESL) employ and manage the Group’s personnel mainly for
the activities of the Concession.

Eurotunnel SE heads the distribution business in continental Europe (excluding France) of the Truck Shuttle Service activity.

Eurotunnel Financial Services Limited is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (registration no. 490713) to resell
insurance products offered to passengers when they make their reservations. CTG acts as a representative of Eurotunnel
Financial Services Limited for these requirements.

Gamond Insurance Company Limited, a wholly-controlled subsidiary of CTG, has been registered in Guernsey since 1996 and
its sole purpose is to provide insurance against acts of terrorism in the United Kingdom (Insurance Business (Bailiwick of
Guernsey) Law, 2002 as modified). On the authorisation of the IGC, this company was created in Guernsey because it is tax
resident in the United Kingdom and its financial results are taxable in full in accordance with the Concession Agreement
(clause 29). The creation of a captive was the only way that the Group could access reinsurance protection guaranteed by
the State via Pool-Re. As such, the company is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC Ref. 96503).

Eurotunnel Trustees Limited is now dormant.

**The Europorte segment**

The holding company Europorte SAS groups together all the Europorte segment’s rail freight transport subsidiaries, which
provide a wide range of integrated rail freight services, including national and international haulage, local services for
secondary lines and services to industry (individual junction management, infrastructure maintenance and wagon loading
and unloading).

The activities of the Europorte segment are carried out by various subsidiaries of the holding company Europorte SAS
including Europorte France (EPF), Socorail and Europorte Channel (EPC). Europorte SAS also owns 20% of the share capital
of Manutention Transport Service SAS (MTS). Europorte Proximité was merged into Socorail in 2020.

**The ElecLink segment**

ElecLink’s corporate purpose is the construction and operation of a 1GW electricity interconnector between the United
Kingdom and France. Preliminary work began towards the end of 2016 and the interconnector is scheduled to be brought
into service mid-2022. GET Elec Limited, a subsidiary of Getlink SE, holds the entire share capital of ElecLink Limited.

**Euro-TransManche**

The Group ceased the activities of the Euro-TransManche companies in 2015.


-----

**1.2** **EUROTUNNEL’S CROSS-CHANNEL ACTIVITIES**

Under the terms of the Concession Agreement, the States have granted the Concessionaires the right and obligation to
design, finance, construct and operate the Fixed Link between France and the United Kingdom without prejudice to the
sovereign role of the States in terms of control and border enforcement. The Concession Agreement, which is described in
chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document, will expire in 2086.

The Fixed Link is an integrated road and rail transport system that includes Shuttle services (for cars and trucks) and a rail
service (passenger and freight trains). The Concessionaires FM and CTG operate the transport system with Shuttles and make
paths available to companies in possession of a licence, allowing them to operate cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger
Trains and Rail Freight Services.

The Fixed Link comprises three tunnels of a length of about 50 kilometres each under the English Channel, as well as the two
terminals at Folkestone in the United Kingdom and Coquelles in France, the fixed equipment and the related installations:

Two rail tunnels with a single track are, during normal service, each used by the trains moving in a single direction.

The third tunnel, located for most of its length between the two main rail tunnels, is a secure means for evacuation and
is also used for Tunnel maintenance.

Two cross over points between the rail tunnels allow trains to change between tunnels during maintenance work on
certain sections of the tunnels.

The Fixed Link is directly connected to the British and French motorway networks, via the Folkestone and Coquelles terminals
which are the departure and arrival points. Retail and food service areas are available to customers at each terminal. The
Fixed Link is also connected to the national French and British rail networks and more particularly to the high-speed lines.

The Eurotunnel segment generated revenue of €692 million in 2020, representing 85% of the Group’s revenues, comprising:

revenue from its Truck and Passenger Shuttle Services for the transport of trucks, cars, coaches and other vehicles
between the United Kingdom and France;

payments received for the use of the Tunnel Railway Network by High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar) and by Train
Operators’ Rail Freight Services; and

ancillary revenues related to the above activities.

**1.2.1** **EUROTUNNEL’S MAIN MARKETS**

Eurotunnel offers both a Shuttle Service between Calais and Folkestone for the transport of passengers, cars, coaches and
trucks and a Railway Network through which Railway Companies can run Rail Freight Services and High-Speed Passenger
Trains. These services operate in the transport market between continental Europe and the United Kingdom.

**a)** **Freight market**

Freight traffic between continental Europe and the United Kingdom is commonly divided into four distinct modes:

Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied: trucks and trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea on Shuttles or ferries at the
same time as the road tractor and driver, mostly via the Short Straits;

Roll-On/Roll-Off unaccompanied: trailers crossing the Channel or the North Sea independently of the road tractor and
its driver, mostly via North Sea routes;

rail freight: conventional or Intermodal trains running through the Tunnel; and

Lift-On/Lift-Off: moveable containers or swap bodies loaded on Lift-On/Lift-Off container ships, mostly on the North Sea
routes.

The modal distribution varies by geographic zone and time constraints.

The market is based on three corridors:

the Short Straits: all routes from continental Europe to Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate (including the Tunnel);

the English Channel: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the south coast of the United Kingdom south west
of Folkestone; and

the North Sea: all routes from continental Europe to ports on the east coast of the United Kingdom north of Ramsgate
(including the Thames estuary).

**Short Straits**

In the freight market, the Truck Shuttle Service is in competition with ferry operators in the accompanied road transport
route across the Short Straits. Over the last 20 years, there has been a marked shift towards the use of accompanied trucks
between continental Europe and the United Kingdom. To date, notwithstanding the impact of the United Kingdom's exit
from the European Union, the Roll-On/Roll-Off accompanied mode on the Short Straits routes currently provides the shortest
and quickest route for crossing the Channel.

**b)** **Passenger market**

Transport services for passengers travelling without their vehicles between the United Kingdom and the continent are mainly
provided by airlines or by High-Speed Passenger Trains and they represent a marginal and indirect source of competition
for Eurotunnel’s Passenger Shuttle Service. Eurostar services operate in the transport market for passengers travelling,
without their vehicles, principally between London and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, these destinations offering the
greatest capacity and connections. Eurostar’s main competitors are the airlines proposing air services between the United
Kingdom and continental Europe.

After seven years of continued growth, the trend reversed in 2018 and in 2019, with the economy and the uncertainty around
Brexit once again having an impact on travel, particularly in Europe. The Covid-19 pandemic, and the measures taken by the
French and British governments to contain the spread of the virus, had an immediate and significant impact on the activity
levels of all international transport operators in 2020.

**Short Straits**

The Shuttles and the ferries carry passengers travelling with their vehicles across the Short Straits between the Hauts-deFrance in France (Coquelles for the Shuttles, Calais and Dunkirk for the ferries) and Kent in the United Kingdom (Folkestone
for the Shuttles and Dover for the ferries).

The business model evolves according to trends in the international market.


-----

**c)** **Competitive position in the Short Straits market**

The Shuttle Services are in direct competition with the ferry services and compete indirectly with airlines and, to a lesser
extent, with Eurostar.

**i)** **Ferry operators**

Cross-Channel ferry operators are using larger ships offering greater capacity and enabling economies of scale to be realised
over the long term, as they look for growth in the freight market rather than the passenger market.

Work on the Calais Port 2015 project was suspended in early 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, thereby extending
its commissioning date which was scheduled for the autumn of 2021[6]. The Calais Port 2015 project planned to merge the
ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer and extend the port of Calais and in particular, its ferry terminal. This could strengthen
the competitive position of ferries by enabling additional capacity. A relevant public service delegation contract was signed
by the Hauts-de-France region of France on 19 February 2015. On 10 April 2015, the Group filed with the Administrative
Court of Lille an application for the annulment of that contract. The court rejected that application in a judgement handed
down on 8 November 2018. The Group appealed to the Douai Administrative Court of Appeal on 8 January 2019. The appeal
is still ongoing.

In addition, the new terminal in the Western Docks of the port of Dover has been commissioned for cargo activity and is
under construction for the rest of the project[7].

Since 2015, only two ferry companies have operated on the Short Straits (P&O Ferries and DFDS Seaways) so overall capacity
is reduced compared to that available previously.

**P&O**

P&O Ferries (“P&O”) is a UK-based ferry operator. It is in direct competition with Eurotunnel in both the freight market and
the passenger market. Until the Covid-19 pandemic, P&O operated up to six vessels on the Short Straits. In 2019 it ordered
two new vessels which, at 230 metres long, were expected to be the largest deployed on routes to and from Dover. Both
vessels are currently scheduled to be brought into service in 2023 (with an option for two additional vessels for delivery in
2024) and are intended to replace three ferries in the current fleet[8].

In September 2019, P&O launched a new service between Calais (France) and Tilbury (United Kingdom) for unaccompanied
freight, which was subsequently terminated in January 2020 given the low demand. In April 2020, P&O significantly reduced
its fleet from six to three ships in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In October 2020 a fourth ship was put back to service
to accommodate the growing freight demand as the result of the stockpiling in anticipation of the end of the Transition
Period on 31 December. Since then, P&O has ended the unaccompanied service on the Calais/Dover route and it offers an
accompanied service only[9].

**DFDS Seaways**

DFDS Seaways (“DFDS”) is owned by the Danish company DFDS. In 2020, DFDS Seaways operated three vessels on the DoverDunkirk route and three on the Calais-Dover route except between April and July 2020 when it temporarily reduced its fleet
from three to two vessels on the Calais-Dover route in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

In 2019, DFDS announced the launch of construction of a ferry chartered for combined freight and passenger transport. This
ferry will replace a vessel in DFDS’s current fleet and should be delivered in mid-2021 for deployment on the English Channel
routes[10].

**ii)** **Eurotunnel’s Shuttle Services**

**Competitive advantages of the Shuttle Service**

The Group considers that, under normal operating conditions, its Shuttle Service benefits from the following competitive
advantages over ferries:

safety: the Group offers a reinforced security system at the site of Coquelles and additional controls before boarding that
reassure Truck Shuttle customers;

speed: the standard travel time between the French and British motorways is generally much shorter than that of its
competitors;

departure frequency: the Shuttle Service runs more frequently than any of its competitors, and it runs every day of the
year;

convenience: with the GSM-P system, Shuttle Services customers have uninterrupted access to GSM and 4G services in
the Tunnel as well as free Wi-Fi access throughout the terminals;

-----

reliability: unlike the ferries, the Shuttle Service is not affected by sailing conditions and is not dependent on the weather;
and

environmentally-friendly: the electric power it uses for traction generates much lower greenhouse gas emissions than
fossil fuels used by the ferries.

In the context of Brexit, the Group deployed a strategic action plan as set out in section 1.1.4 of this Universal Registration
Document including developing its infrastructure and digitalising and adapting its ways of working to preserve and
strengthen these advantages. The fact that the Passenger Shuttle customers travel in their own vehicles throughout the
journey with minimal interaction with other people is a safety advantage, on top of the additional Covid-19 pandemic safety
measures put in place by the Group which provide further reassurance to its customers and staff. Eurotunnel's Shuttle
Services were certified on 23 February 2021 by AFNOR (the French standards authority) following verification of the Covid19 health-protection measures implemented with a maximum score of 100% as set out in section 6.5.3 of this Universal
Registration Document.

**iii)** **Airlines**

Airlines, and particularly low-cost airlines, also have an indirect impact on the Short Straits market, which has been limited
in 2020 in the context of the air transport crisis. In times of normal operation, these companies serve many destinations in
continental Europe (including France) and thus compete with operators in the Short Straits, including the Passenger Shuttle
Service in the short stay leisure market.

**iv)** **Eurostar**

To a lesser extent and even less in 2020, Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains compete indirectly with the Passenger
Shuttle Service in the leisure market.

**1.2.2** **EUROTUNNEL’S ACTIVITIES**

Eurotunnel operates and directly markets its Shuttle Services which comprise Truck Shuttles transporting heavy goods
vehicles and Passenger Shuttles transporting passengers in their vehicles (including cars, coaches, motorbikes and motor
homes). Railway Companies’ High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services may also travel through the Tunnel in
return for payment of a toll: Eurotunnel does not operate these services but manages their passage on the Railway Network.

**a)** **Shuttle transport activities**

In 2020, Shuttle Services generated revenue of €521 million, representing 64% of Group revenue, through the operation of
its Truck and Passenger Shuttles compared to €627 million in 2019 (representing 58% of overall Group revenue). The
decrease in revenue is due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (see sections 2.1 and 2.2.1 notes A.1 and D.9 of this
Universal Registration Document).

**i)** **Truck Shuttle Service**

The Truck Shuttle Service carries trucks between France and the United Kingdom on Truck Shuttles. At each terminal, drivers
pass through dedicated Truck check-in, safety, security and border control facilities. Drivers and passengers do not remain
in their vehicles during the crossing, but travel in specially designed carriages called Club-Cars.

For more than two years, Eurotunnel's teams have been preparing to deal with all Brexit eventualities in order to offer the
best possible service to customers and to ensure smooth passage and efficient border controls. The various safety, security
and migration checks and the collection of data on cargo in trucks have been brought together at a single point before
border controls at each terminal called the Pit-Stops. A new SIVEP Customs Centre (the French veterinary and phytosanitary
service) has been built near the Coquelles terminal in which to carry out the new customs, veterinary and phytosanitary
controls.

As part of its Brexit preparations, Eurotunnel has been working to maintain a smooth service for the re-establishment of
customs formalities in force since 1 January 2021 and has launched a new service for its transport customers called the
Eurotunnel Border Pass. This service enables the information required from the carrier in respect of goods to be pre-notified
digitally and securely to Eurotunnel and then from Eurotunnel to the authorities in both countries, without the driver having
to get out of the lorry when crossing the border, or even presenting a document when arriving at the border. On arrival at
the Pit-Stop, the information is automatically matched with the truck's registration plate and the driver does not have to
present any documentation.

At the beginning of December, Eurotunnel launched its new website "letruckvillage.com" where truck drivers can find all the
information they need before arriving at the Coquelles terminal. Open and secure 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Le Truck
Village offers 270 new parking spaces for trucks, connections for refrigeration units, various services for the comfort of lorry
drivers and a cabin to check drivers’ temperatures as part of the health measures. In the border services building, a dedicated
Eurotunnel team welcomes drivers and assists them to complete the new customs formalities in force since 1 January 2021.


-----

**Strategy**

Truck service marketing strategy

The public health crisis has affirmed the relevance of the strategy of optimising Truck Shuttle revenue and a pricing policy
that reflects the fair value of the service provided by Eurotunnel - its speed, ease, reliability and safety.

Eurotunnel has a mechanism in place to optimise Truck Shuttle revenue based on a pricing policy consisting of more flexible
prices, adjustable according to demand and available capacity. The aim is to encourage an improved distribution of truck
flows at all times of day and all week long, so that capacity and load factors can be optimised, whilst maintaining service
quality during peak days. Throughout the year, Eurotunnel gives priority to customers under contract, only providing
transport to occasional customers as available capacity allows.

Customer experience: “Simply Better Freight”

The Simply Better Freight programme has had the effect of simplifying all aspects of Truck Shuttle customers’ journey
through the two terminals in Coquelles and Folkestone for a simpler and more reliable service in terms of journey time while
placing the safety of people and process control at the centre of its requirements. Eurotunnel continues to work on the
fluidity of service and controls to provide the best possible service to customers and to optimise Shuttle load factors and
operating margins.

**Truck Shuttle Service market share**

Eurotunnel estimates that its share of the Truck Shuttle Service market on the Short Straits corridor has evolved as follows:

**2020** **2019**


**Market share**


**Vehicles**


**(estimate)** **Vehicles**


**Market**

**share**


Accompanied trucks * 1,451,556 39.5% 1,595,241 40.4%

- Number of accompanied trucks transported by the Truck Shuttle Service. The Short Straits market share has been calculated using market data as reported
by IRN Services Limited.

Up to the end of February 2020, the Eurotunnel segment’s Truck Shuttle traffic was down by 9% compared to the
corresponding period in 2019, due to stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit which had boosted traffic at the end of 2019. With
effect from mid-March 2020, some market sectors, such as industrial and automotive, were severely impacted by the strict
lockdowns and other restrictive measures imposed across Europe due to the Covid-19 pandemic, although other sectors,
such as food, pharmaceuticals and e-commerce, proved to be more resilient. As a result, Truck Shuttle traffic decreased by
28% in the second half of March, 34% in April and 29% in May of 2020 (in each case, compared to the same months of 2019).
Starting from June 2020, the effect of gradual lifting of those measures began to be felt with less reduced traffic, month-onmonth: Truck Shuttle traffic decreased by 11% in June and by 6% for the months of July and August but increased by 2% in
September 2020. However, the exceptional surge of volume observed in October 2019 in anticipation of the implementation
of Brexit then expected on 31 October 2019 explained the traffic decrease of 7% in October 2020. From November 2020,
stockpiling by British companies before the end of the Transition Period on 31 December boosted traffic. However, the
Covid-19 tests required from 21 December by the French government for all passengers including freight drivers coming
from the United Kingdom reduced the demand until the end of the year: Truck Shuttle traffic increased by 11% in November
and 8% in December.

In the Short Straits cross-Channel truck market, which contracted by approximately 6.9% during 2020 compared to 2019, the
Eurotunnel segment’s Truck Shuttle Service’s market share decreased by 0.9 points to 39.5% in 2020 compared to 40.4% in
2019.

**ii)** **Passenger Shuttle Service (Le Shuttle)**

The Passenger Shuttle Service carries cars, motor homes, caravans, coaches, motorcycles and trailers between France and
the United Kingdom onboard trains (Shuttles). Customers remain in their vehicle throughout the crossing, which normally
lasts approximately 35 minutes from platform to platform. Each Passenger Shuttle has two sections: a double deck section
mainly for cars and motorcycles and a single deck section reserved for vehicles higher than 1.85 metres, mainly coaches,
minibuses and cars with roof boxes or towing caravans.

The Passenger Shuttle Service can operate up to five departures per hour in each direction.

As part of its Brexit preparations, biometric facial recognition Parafe gates have been installed at Coquelles and Folkestone
for coach passengers to improve the smooth flow of checks. Eurotunnel has installed four Pablo kiosks in the Charles Dickens
Passenger Building in Coquelles so that customers can claim back the tax paid on their purchases.


-----

**Strategy**

The Group seeks to improve its Passenger Shuttle revenue by optimising the average revenue per Shuttle departure. Since
2016, additional flexibility has been added in that small commercial vehicles with a reservation can travel in Passenger
Shuttles. Scanners on the passenger terminals reinforce security measures for this service.

Pricing policy: dynamic pricing

The pricing system adjusts ticket prices according to departure time and Shuttle load factor, thereby optimising passenger
revenue and the average ticket price for passenger vehicles (including cars, motor homes, caravans and motorcycles).

Tickets can be bought in advance from the website (www.eurotunnel.com), using mobile apps, by telephone from the
customer service centre, from travel agents and on arrival at check-in. Approximately 90% of Le Shuttle customer bookings
are made online.

Adapting capacity to demand

The capacity of the Passenger Shuttle Service is regularly adjusted to improve the load factor and reduce costs. Operational
adjustments are made to enable this, such as a better distribution of Shuttle departures during the day, with limited
Passenger Shuttles at off peak times, increased services during peak times and the optimisation of train crew management.

Customer service (“Customer Experience” and “Simply Better”)

As a service business, Eurotunnel Le Shuttle puts the customer at the heart of its strategy and uses every means to enhance
their satisfaction and loyalty:

Actions and developments, with Brexit in mind, aimed at strengthening safety while speeding up passenger flows at
borders, both on boarding and arrival, and contributing to increasing customer satisfaction.

Improved real-time information, for each customer at every stage of their experience with Eurotunnel, with the roll-out
of the digital transformation plan including new information boards.

Tailoring services to take account of the specific needs of each customer segment, such as drivers of electric vehicles or
motorbikes, those travelling with their pets and customers with restricted movement. Le Shuttle also promotes lowcarbon travel by offering a service to cross the Channel with a bicycle.

The Flexiplus service for customers who have priority boarding as well as two modern, dedicated lounges providing
snacks, newspapers and Wi-Fi).

Providing automatic check-in facilities with automatic number plate recognition for all pre-reserved customers, which
has reduced this stage of the customer journey to approximately a minute.

The Group is accelerating its digital transformation, with the main objectives of improving the customer experience,
increasing the fluidity of customer service and optimising Tunnel and Shuttle maintenance. These measures were founded
on two pillars: the creation of a digital culture within the business and the installation of a high-performing and extremely
secure IT technical platform.

**Passenger Shuttle Service market share**

Eurotunnel estimates its share of the car and coach passenger markets on the Short Straits has evolved as follows:

**2020** **2019**


**Market share**


**Vehicles**


**(estimate)** **Vehicles**


**Market**

**share**


Cars * 1,399,051 70.1% 2,601,791 56.9%

Coaches ** 14,382 54.9% 50,268 40.5%

- Number of vehicles transported by the Passenger Shuttle Service. The market share has been calculated by converting the number of vehicles transported
into Car Equivalent Units (“CEU”) and determining the Passenger Shuttle Service’s share of total CEU transported on the Short Straits as reported by IRN
Services Limited.
** Number of vehicles transported by the Passenger Shuttle Service. The market share has been calculated using market data as reported by IRN Services
Limited.

The measures put in place by governments to limit the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic from mid-March 2020 onwards
included closing international borders for non-essential travel. As a result, the level of Passenger Shuttle Service tourist traffic
decreased dramatically from that date: by 75% in the second half of March compared to 2019 then 91% in April, 81% in May
and 69% in June 2020. The temporary lifting of the quarantine measures imposed by the British government for the month
of July and the first part of August enabled the Passenger Shuttle Service's car activity to regain some of its seasonal summer
traffic. However, the reintroduction of quarantine measures from mid-August, as well as the new lockdown measures
imposed in Europe and the United Kingdom in the last quarter of 2020 and the border crossing restrictions introduced by
the French government in December had a significant impact on Eurotunnel's tourist traffic over the entire period.


-----

Whilst the Short Straits cross-Channel car market as a whole contracted by 56.2% in 2020, the Eurotunnel segment’s car
market share, with its health and safety advantages for customers, who remain in their own vehicle throughout the journey
with minimal contact with other people, increased by 13.2 points to 70.1% for the year. Eurotunnel’s Passenger Shuttle car
activity transported 1,399,051 vehicles in 2020, down by 46% compared to 2019.

In 2020, the Short Straits cross-Channel coach market contracted by 78.9% compared to 2019. However the Passenger
Shuttle’s share of the coach market increased to 54.9% (2019: 40.5%).

**b)** **Railway Network**

In 2020, the Group earned 20% of its revenue from the use of the Railway Network by Railway Companies’ High-Speed
Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services. The Group does not operate these trains but manages their passage through the
Tunnel.

The use of the Tunnel by the Railway Companies is governed by the Railway Usage Contract with the national Railways,
which is in force until 2052, as presented in chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document. Under this charging
framework, the Railways are obliged to pay to the Group variable charges according to the number of passengers on HighSpeed Passenger Trains as well as fixed annual charges. The variable charges are determined on the basis of a toll formula,
which takes into account the effects of inflation to a certain extent. In addition, the Railways are required to contribute to
the operating costs of the System, as well as to investment costs relating to the renewal of equipment.

The Railway Usage Contract’s long-term charging framework is applied and published every year by the Concessionaires in
the Fixed Link’s Network Statement which sets out access conditions to its Railway Network for all Railway Companies, for
the operation of High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services, as well as the charging scale for the relevant year.
The Network Statement now sets out a simplified charging mechanism for rail freight trains, with a charge per train, instead
of per tonne of freight as was originally the case.

The Group’s revenue from its Railway Network is thus generated from variable charges received based on the number of
passengers transported by Eurostar High-Speed Passenger Trains and the number of Rail Freight Services trains, annual fixed
charges and the contribution to the operating costs of the System.

In 2020, the Group generated revenue €163 million from the use of its Railway Network, down 48% on 2019 due to the
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

**i)** **High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar and future new market entrants)**

**Market developments**

The market for High-Speed Passenger Train services (Eurostar and future new entrants) comprises business and leisure
passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. The market is geographically diverse and
includes, on the one hand, inter-capital travel between London and Paris or London and Brussels and Amsterdam and, on
the other hand, a wider flow of passengers travelling between the United Kingdom and France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Germany and Switzerland. Eurostar also operates a direct service to Disneyland Paris and to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille
during the spring and summer and a service to Bourg-Saint-Maurice in winter. As part of a cost-cutting plan in response to
the Covid-19 crisis, Eurostar announced in 2020 the suspension of services to and closure of the Ashford, Ebbsfleet and
Calais-Fréthun terminals for the duration of the public health crisis as well as the suspension of its seasonal services to the
French Alps and the South of France for the winter and 2021 summer seasons.

Combined data on market growth for Eurostar and the airlines is presented below.

**Total** **2,503** **55.2%** **11,047** **57.9%**

- The market share percentages have been calculated as the share of the volume of rail passengers in the total rail and air traffic between Paris and London
and between Amsterdam, Brussels and London as reported by CAA, BRB and SNCF.

The coronavirus public health crisis comes against a backdrop of a favourable trend in the cross-Channel passenger rail
market, with more than a decade of robust performance in spite of unfavourable events: Eurostar recorded an average
growth in traffic of 2% over five years (from 2009 to 2014) followed by a contraction of 4% after the shock of the terrorist
attacks in 2015/2016. A recovery in 2017/2018 saw volumes grow beyond those of 2014 and 2015 on existing routes (London
to Paris and Brussels). Growth was further boosted in 2018/2019 by the introduction of the direct service to Amsterdam and
Rotterdam (two daily services with a direct outward service, with a change at Brussels on the return leg from April 2018) then
an increase in frequency (three daily services) from June 2019. Thus, despite the considerable impact of the strikes by French
customs officers in the spring and the SNCF strikes against pension reforms in December, 2019 resulted in a 1% increase in
traffic and passed the milestone of 11 million travellers for the first time.

The Covid-19 pandemic severely affected the international passenger transport sector in 2020, which was directly impacted
by a succession of travel restrictions (lockdowns, non-essential travel bans, quarantine and/or pre-trip negative test
requirements and so on) that strongly restricted demand. Eurostar reacted to the multiple variations in government measures
by adapting its transport plan upwards or downwards, without any interruption of services on its core inter-capital market,
thereby ensuring the continuity of the cross-Channel rail link unlike the majority of the air and maritime sectors. Following
the closure of the borders to non-essential travel in mid-March 2020, Eurostar's service offer was accordingly rapidly reduced
to a minimal service of two return trips per day (one London-Paris and one London-Brussels) carrying a reduced number of
travellers (repatriations, essential travel, and later on cross-border workers). At the same time, gradual relaxation measures
from mid-May, the introduction by the United Kingdom in early June 2020 of 14-day quarantine measures for almost all
persons entering its territory seriously limited and delayed the resumption of Eurostar traffic until they were lifted in July.
Between mid-July and mid-August, the easing of travel restrictions led to an appreciable increase in Eurostar passenger
traffic and supply, which was abruptly halted by the UK government's reintroduction of the mandatory 14-day quarantine
for travellers from Belgium (8 August 2020) and then from France and the Netherlands (15 August 2020), which further
reduced Eurostar passenger traffic. The second lockdown in England from 5 November resulted in a second service period
of a minimal amount of two return trips per day, now improved by services to Lille, Rotterdam and Amsterdam. A brief period
of relaxation of travel restrictions before Christmas allowed a one-off rebound in Eurostar supply and traffic, which came to
an abrupt end on 21 December 2020 with strict restrictions in response to the new variant of the coronavirus (negative pretrip test and other restrictions). Although dominated by these extreme constraints, the year 2020 saw some positive
developments, including the launch of the Amsterdam-London direct service (return trip) on 26 October, rapid growth in
supply and strong latent demand during periods of easing restrictions and the introduction in the United Kingdom on
15 December of the "Test to Release" programme allowing the fourteen-day period to be shortened to five days by means
of a negative test. As a result of these developments, 2,503,419 Eurostar passengers used the Tunnel in 2020, a decrease of
77% compared to 2019.

In addition, in accordance with the pricing framework indexing formula set out in the Railway Usage Contract the unit toll
per passenger paid by Eurostar decreased by 0.3% in 2020 in a context of falling inflation.

**The competitive environment of High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar)**

Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Trains connect London with the centre of Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam and compete
directly with airlines (both traditional and low-cost) operating these routes in the business and leisure segments, in terms of
travel time, frequency, comfort and price. In addition, for short-stay leisure trips, Eurostar also competes with low-cost airlines
whether in terms of price, capacity and choice of destination, not only for destinations served by Eurostar but also for other
short-haul destinations. Within the framework of the liberalisation of the international rail passenger transport market on
1 January 2010, the Group published its efficient and non-discriminatory conditions for access in its Network Statement
thereby offering all Railway Companies including new entrants the opportunity to operate cross-Channel High-Speed
Passenger Train services to existing or new destinations in competition with each other and with the airline sector.


-----

**High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar)**

Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger Train services are operated by Eurostar International Limited, owned 55% by SNCF, 5% by
SNCB, and 40% by a consortium comprising CDPQ, the Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec and Hermes Infrastructure.
In September 2019, Eurostar and Thalys announced a proposed alliance, “Green Speed”, to combine their high-speed service
networks, develop an offering of new sustainable mobility services and increase rail passenger volumes.

Eurostar’s rolling stock fleet primarily comprises recent Siemens e320 trains (introduced in 2015) offering a high level of
comfort (on-board Wi-Fi, individual sockets), power (top speed of 320km/h), capacity (nearly 900 passengers, 20% more
than the original fleet) and interoperability (electrical power supply and cab signalling systems compatible with the Dutch
network). The Eurostar fleet also includes modernised Alstom e300 trains offering a similar level of comfort to the e320.

Since 2007, the High-Speed Passenger Trains services have benefited from the high-speed line between London St Pancras
International and the Tunnel which has reduced the transit time between Paris and London or Brussels and London by around
20 minutes. With the destinations served by London St Pancras International station, it has improved rail links with northern
England (proximity of rail services from St Pancras, King’s Cross and Euston stations). Ebbsfleet International station, located
near the M25 London orbital motorway, also allows Eurostar to expand its catchment area.

In 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, Eurostar ran 13 to 19 departures in each direction between Paris and London and 8 to
10 trains in each direction between London and Brussels (including two to three daily services from London to Amsterdam)
on week days, with adjustments depending on the day, the season and the destination. Some services make intermediate
stops at Ebbsfleet or Ashford International in the United Kingdom and at Calais-Fréthun or Lille-Europe in France. Eurostar
ran a service to Disneyland Paris four to seven days a week (except in January) and seasonal services from London and
Ashford to Bourg-Saint-Maurice with two return journeys a week (from December to April in normal circumstances) as well
as a spring/summer seasonal service (May to September) in 2019 from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille with three or
four return journeys a week.

In 2020, Eurostar regularly adjusted its capacity and services upwards and downwards in response to the various health
restrictions (lockdown, quarantine and non-essential travel bans) imposed by the United Kingdom, French, Belgian and Dutch
governments as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the periods of maximum restrictions (April and November
lockdowns and travel bans) Eurostar offered a minimum inter-capital service of one daily round trip between Paris and
London and one daily round trip London-Brussels, also providing (from autumn) direct service to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
and Lille. During periods of severe restrictions (no ban on leisure travel, but with a fortnight’s quarantine requirement),
Eurostar operated one to four daily return services between Paris and London, and one or two services to Brussels and
Amsterdam. Finally, during the short periods when travel restrictions were lifted, Eurostar gradually increased its offer to
almost 60% of its 2019 service, with four to eight round trips between London and Paris and three to five London-Brussels
rotations (including two to Amsterdam), as well as its direct service to Disneyland Paris (from mid-July to mid-August 2020).
As part of a cost-saving plan, Eurostar also announced a simplified fleet operation (e320 trains only) as well as the suspension
of services to and closure of the Ashford, Ebbsfleet and Calais-Fréthun terminals for the duration of the public health crisis,
and the cancellation of its seasonal services to the French Alps and the South of France for the winter and 2021 summer
seasons.

**Development of new destinations**

To help accelerate the development of new cross-Channel passenger rail links and to accelerate the realisation of these new
service opportunities, the Group has developed the ETICA-Pax (Eurotunnel Incentive for Capacity Additions - Passengers), a
financial assistance mechanism for the launch of new cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Train services. Through the
ETICA-Pax programme, the Group contributes to creating direct services to new destinations by reducing the launch cost of
these new services and proportionally rewarding Railway Companies for their market development efforts.

The direct London - Amsterdam service was originally launched in April 2018 in the form of a direct single journey in the
direction London to Amsterdam and Rotterdam, with the Amsterdam-London return journey requiring a stop at Brussels for
passport and security checks. The service nevertheless began with two daily services on weekdays. A third daily service was
added by Eurostar in June 2019 in response to strong demand.

In order to allow direct travel in the direction Amsterdam and Rotterdam to London, the British and Dutch governments
concluded on 7 July 2020 the international treaties necessary to set up juxtaposed border controls in the Netherlands, and
on 26 October 2020 Eurostar launched its new direct return service to and from both Amsterdam and London. This service
enables travellers to save an hour's travel time and enjoy the comfort of a direct service in both directions. This is a historic
milestone in the expansion of high-speed international rail travel on this major route, which represented nearly 5 million
passengers in 2019. Passengers can now travel from the heart of London directly to the Netherlands and back at a speed of
300km/h, in nearly three hours to Rotterdam and four hours to the centre of Amsterdam. The introduction of this essential
factor for attractiveness and competitiveness makes it possible to offer a relevant and competitive high-speed rail service
alongside air services on this major European and global air route.


-----

As soon as the travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis allow it, Eurostar will be able to reintroduce then
increase the frequency of direct services between London and Amsterdam, with the four daily services previously announced
then more over time. With the ETICA-Pax incentive scheme, Eurotunnel contributes to the launch and accelerated
development of these services.

From 2015 to 2019, Eurostar operated a direct seasonal service from London to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille in the spring
and summer months, although, as mentioned above, this service has been cancelled for 2020 and 2021 as a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic. However, this service required passengers to disembark at Lille on the return trip for border controls
and therefore there remains significant potential for improving competitiveness.

Further opportunities for direct services exist notably to Germany (Cologne, Frankfurt), Switzerland (Geneva) and southern
France (Marseille as a direct return, Bordeaux and the Côte d’Azur). Moreover, government initiatives and public awareness
in favour of the climate emergency and respect for the environment demonstrate a growing interest in the development and
use of rail mobility services over longer distances, which could facilitate the emergence of high-speed cross-Channel rail
services to new destinations, hitherto the province of air services.

In 2010, Deutsche Bahn stated its intention to launch ICE High-Speed Passenger Train services from London to Cologne and
Frankfurt. The operating model for these services was finally authorised by the IGC in June 2013, but a development plan is
yet to be confirmed due to major project delays.

A study carried out by an international consulting firm in 2018 demonstrated the development potential of alternative lowcost rail services between secondary stations in Paris and London such as, for example, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Stratford
International. This study confirmed both the complementary nature of such a link with the line currently operated and its
potential profitability.

These service development projects require the resolution of a number of technical, equipment and regulatory constraints
(including, for example, rolling stock authorisations, efficient security and border controls, improved access to and
modification of stations, investment in interoperability, development of train paths and long-term visibility), as well as
cooperation between the relevant national authorities in respect of the implementation of efficient border controls. The
Group is continuing its long-term efforts with national authorities and rail organisations to eliminate these barriers to the
development of new destinations.

Significant progress has been achieved with the implementation of “open access” for international passenger services across
Europe and the increasing application of interoperability standards, notably with efforts to standardise IGC technical
requirements for cross-Channel High-Speed Passenger Trains.

Further progress remains necessary, in particular with regards to border controls, to develop solutions that are efficient and
tailored to the type of destination (preparation of boarding areas in stations for juxtaposed controls for frequent services
between capital cities and other models comprising on-board control or controls on arrival for regular regional services) and
thereby preserve the benefits of speed and convenience that are essential to the competitiveness of High-Speed Passenger
Train services.

Further standardisation of authorisation rules and processes to authorise the movement of rolling stock and the ability to
use new equipment are also essential to facilitating the development of the market. In this regard, the Group continued to
invest to adapt its electric traction installations to accommodate new rolling stock in optimal conditions, as was done for
Eurostar’s Siemens e320 trains.

The Group is working in close cooperation with rail infrastructure managers on initiatives aimed at reducing these barriers
to developing, facilitating and promoting the introduction of new direct destinations (notably interoperability investments
and boarding areas in stations). In this context, the Group continued and extended its cooperation with other infrastructures
through concrete initiatives such as the development of interoperable signalling systems on the London-Paris-Brussels
routes (ERTMS), the design of an international terminal for border controls at Bordeaux Saint Jean (development of the
Bordeaux-London market) and proposed applications of this cooperation model for the development of boarding areas in
stations and border controls for other new destinations and in particular for the development of direct rail services between
London, Cologne and Frankfurt.

**ii)** **Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services**

**Market developments**

Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services compete with most means of sea and rail transport between continental Europe
and the United Kingdom. They offer their own advantages of efficiency and attractiveness with a Channel crossing with no
load transfer required and a means of transport that is particularly environmentally-friendly and potentially a quality of
service not affected by congestion nor weather conditions.

After a significant surge in traffic from 2010 to mid-2015, which was wiped out by the Calais migrant crisis in 2015 followed
by a progressive recovery from 2016 to 2019, the Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services traffic was substantially affected
by SNCF strikes in 2018 and 2019 and by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.

The freight volume transported by Rail Freight Services is summarised below:

**Railway Companies' Rail Freight Services** **2020** **2019**

Cross-Channel rail freight (million tonnes) 1.14 1.39

Number of train crossings 1,736 2,144

Sources: Eurotunnel, DB Cargo on behalf of BRB, SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Rail Operations Group, RailAdventure and Europorte.

**Competitive environment of the Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services**

Rail freight through the Tunnel, originally developed by the state-run Railways, has had a history of disappointing results
and organisational difficulties. International rail freight is also held back by inadequate national infrastructure (in particular
train gauge, length and weight restrictions in the United Kingdom, quality and availability of paths in France), distortions in
favour of sea and road transport and excessive regulatory, workforce and technical constraints.

Rail freight trains are in competition with most modes of freight transport in operation between continental Europe and the
United Kingdom and, in particular, with unaccompanied maritime services via the North Sea, with onward road or rail
transport in continental Europe.

**Railway Companies’ Rail Freight Services**

Rail Freight Services between continental Europe and the United Kingdom are run by Railway Companies including DB Cargo
(on behalf of BRB), SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, RailAdventure, Europorte, Rail Operations Group and potentially
any goods train operator in open access. Three different types of Rail Freight Services use the Tunnel’s Railway Network:

Intermodal trains, composed of platform wagons transporting containers or swap bodies;

conventional trains (carrying palletised goods in enclosed wagons or bulk loads in adapted wagons such as tankers,
hoppers, platforms, and so on) carried as a trainload; and

trains with specialised wagons for transporting new cars.

In order to revive cross-Channel rail freight, the Group has adopted a strategy based on three pillars: (i) development of
open access for rail freight operators, (ii) efficient processing of border constraints, and (iii) a simplified and competitive
pricing policy.
With the aim of promoting the development of Rail Freight Services traffic in the Tunnel, the Group has put in place ETICAFreight, a programme to help the launch of new services. These initiatives demonstrated their pertinence with a sustained
period of traffic growth between 2010 and mid-2015, which was translated into cumulative growth of more than 40% in the
number of trains, including the creation of new Intermodal services and an increase in the flow of aluminium and automobile
components.
This growth dynamic was halted abruptly in the summer of 2015 during the peak of the migrant crisis in the Calais area
which resulted in the loss of half of the cross-Channel Rail Freight Services, as it shifted either to unaccompanied services or
to container transport via the North Sea, or more generally to transportation by road.
In 2016, the set-up of effective security for cross-Channel rail freight operations allowed traffic to stabilise at the level reached
at the end of 2015, followed by a return to growth due to the ramp-up of services assisted by ETICA-Freight during 2017,
2018 and 2019 (and the launch of new Intermodal Rail Freight Services to Germany and Italy, suspended following the SNCF
strike in the second half of 2018). In 2020, rail freight traffic recorded a drop both in train numbers which decreased by 19%
and in tonnage transported which decreased by 18%, being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic with the temporary
suspension of steel and automobile flows, and also by steel customers’ restructurings.


-----

**Development of services and competitiveness**

Following the loss of half of cross-Channel Rail Freight Services in 2015, the Group informed the European Commission that
the common rail freight growth objectives could not be attained. The Group continues to work with the governments and
the Railway Companies on implementing solutions to stimulate the revival of this traffic.

In 2018, the Group completed the construction of a full-train scanner on the national railway network in Fréthun and in 2019,
the Group received authorisation to commission this scanner, which now enables customs officials to control Rail Freight
Services trains moving at a speed of 20km/h, enhancing the security and fluidity of cross-Channel rail freight and
consequently its attractiveness. The Group also participated in working groups with the authorities and rail freight players
to organise the fluidity of cross-Channel Rail Freight Services in various Brexit scenarios, leading to digitalisation of customs
formalities and their relocation to origin and destination rail terminals. This offers a robust process, independent of port and
road border infrastructure, which is attractive to transporters interested in non-accompanied solutions and to loaders seeking
to diversify their logistics chains. In addition, the Group extended its ETICA-Freight financial aid programme to support the
launch of new destinations, creating a growing interest in the development of new services.

In order for these growth efforts to produce their full effect, the Group continues to draw the attention of the authorities to
the need to progressively address the barriers to development existing on the national networks such as train gauge, length
and tonnage limits, network quality and availability and border constraints. These barriers continue to hold back the
development of cross-Channel rail freight and represent a considerable potential for efficiencies waiting to be unlocked.

**c)** **Other revenue**

In 2020, Eurotunnel’s other revenue was €8 million, representing 1% of the Group’s total revenue. This revenue consists
mainly of revenue from third-party retail businesses in the terminals on both sides of the Tunnel, revenue from
telecommunication lines in the Tunnel, revenue related to the property business and lastly revenue from the sale of travel
insurance products in the United Kingdom.

**Revenue from third-party retail businesses**

At its two terminals, in France and the United Kingdom, Eurotunnel welcomes its customers in buildings containing shops
and other retail outlets. Access to the shops, bars and restaurants is available only to customers travelling on the Shuttle
Services. They are located inside the terminals, after check-in and are operated by third parties.

Eurotunnel’s strategy is to offer travellers a choice and level of service consistent with the overall quality and value of service
offered by Eurotunnel. The Victor Hugo passenger terminal building in Folkestone and the Charles Dickens building in
Coquelles offer the highest international airport standards to welcome customers in a pleasant environment, and there are
Flexiplus lounges reserved for premium customers.

In anticipation of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, since 2019 Eurotunnel has entered into discussions
with the French authorities with a view to reopening duty-free shops at the French terminal. For its part, the United Kingdom
confirmed this possibility at the British terminal in 2020.

**Property business**

The Group owns and manages plots of land near its French and British terminals.

From the outset of the Fixed Link project, the Group was given responsibility for local land development as an extension of
its mission to design, build and operate the Fixed Link. The Fixed Link is not just a transport infrastructure: it was also designed
as a platform for the future economic development of the Kent and Calais regions.

**1.2.3** **EUROTUNNEL: CAPACITY OF THE FIXED LINK**

**a)** **The System**

**i)** **The Tunnel**

The number of trains or Shuttles that can pass through the Tunnel every hour is limited. Tunnel capacity is expressed in terms
of the number of standard paths per hour in each direction. A standard path is defined as the time it takes a Shuttle train
operating at 140km/h to cover that part of the System which, under normal operating conditions, is used by all other trains
travelling through the Tunnel. One of the key factors determining the Tunnel’s capacity is the signalling system. At the date
of this Universal Registration Document, the System permits 20 standard paths per hour in each direction.


-----

Under the Railway Usage Contract, Railway Companies’ trains using the Railway Network are entitled to use up to 50% of
the hourly capacity of the Tunnel that is allowed by the signalling system. This currently amounts to ten standard paths per
hour in each direction for High-Speed Passenger Trains (Eurostar and future new entrants) and Rail Freight Services. Railway
Companies’ High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services, because of their faster or slower speeds relative to
Eurotunnel’s Truck and Passenger Shuttle Services, use more than one standard path to travel through the Tunnel. At peak
times, speeds can be adjusted to increase the number of trains and Shuttles travelling through the Tunnel.

Goods trains currently transport an average load of about 500 to 600 tonnes each, although some of them can transport
more than 1,000 tonnes of freight, and travel at speeds varying between 100 and 120km/h. An increase in the average load
or travel speed of these trains would allow the Railway Companies to increase rail freight traffic without additional use of
the Tunnel’s capacity. Similarly, increasing unit capacity and occupancy on High-Speed Passenger Trains (those of Eurostar
and new market entrants) and, for example, synchronising them so that they run in batches would enable more passengers
to be transported without using additional Tunnel capacity. For both types of traffic, the increased unit occupancy rate of
the trains enables Railway Companies to increase the economic efficiency of their services, thus creating a natural incentive
to make optimum use of the Tunnel capacity. In this context, the e320 trains put into service by Eurostar in 2015 offer a 20%
increase in unit capacity compared to the original fleet, leading to a proportional increase in the Tunnel capacity in terms of
the number of passengers. In the same way, the pricing structure by goods trains has led to a substantial increase in the
average load factor since 2007.

Under the terms of the Railway Usage Contract, Eurotunnel may use any surplus capacity not used by the Railway Companies
if they have not confirmed their capacity requirement by the previous day. Use of this surplus capacity provides the Group
with additional flexibility in optimising the flow of traffic and scheduling Railway Companies’ and Shuttle Service departures.

At the date of this Universal Registration Document, the Tunnel’s capacity under normal operating conditions does not
constitute a significant constraint to growth in the different types of traffic. The average path occupancy rate, which
corresponds to the total current consumption of paths (Eurotunnel Shuttles and Railways) over the total capacity available,
reached 53% in the 2019 reference year (rather than in 2020 which was affected by the Covid-19 crisis) through a reduction
in the number of Truck Shuttle departures and an increase in the load factor as part of the “Simply Better Freight” programme
(see section 1.2.2.a.i above), which will allow total traffic to grow still further whilst also greatly improving CO2 emissions per
unit of transport. This average rate does not however reflect the optimisation of path use at peak times. At peak times, the
Tunnel utilisation rate in 2019, the reference year in view of the public health crisis in 2020, often reached 80% and sometimes
even 90% on busy days.

As part of its mid-term strategic thinking for Eurotunnel, the Group is working on optimising availability of the Tunnel itself.
In the medium or long term, the Group believes that it will be possible to increase the Tunnel’s capacity, while still optimising
the production of CO2 per transported unit, by the following means:

Setting uniform operating speeds for all trains, which would allow more trains to run on the same number of standard
paths. Currently, goods trains travel in the Tunnel at a speed of 100 or 120km/h, while High-Speed Passenger Trains can
reach a speed of 160km/h in the Tunnel. These speed differentials use a large part of the System capacity, because they
require Eurotunnel to leave greater intervals between trains than would be necessary if they all travelled at the same
speed. Use of the System’s capacity could therefore be improved by shifting slow or infrequent freight trains to off-peak
times, and by scheduling trains that travel at speeds higher (160km/h) or lower (120km/h) than the standard path
(140km/h) so that they run in batches during peak hours.

Improving journey times and speeds at the Tunnel entrances (capacity control section) by removing the departure power
limitation linked to the four pagodas on the Truck Shuttles and by increasing the power of the locomotives pulling the
Shuttles.

Improving the electrical power supply by replacing the booster with better and more powerful equipment, aimed at
improving the quality of the electrical signal.

Reducing the spacing between trains using the Tunnel so as to raise System capacity to 24 standard paths per hour in
both directions via an improvement in the fixed equipment and the installation of an ATO (Automatic Train Operation)
on board trains to reduce the impact of safety rules specific to the Tunnel relating to train spacing.

Improving the rail signalling system, notably with the European Train Control System (ETCS) that aims to optimise border
crossings while guaranteeing traffic safety.

In addition to these steps, the Group is also working on optimising the use of the Tunnel, with economic, commercial and
environmental objectives.

Some of these measures require approval by the IGC, which has supervisory authority over Tunnel operation.

As part of the strategy to continually improve and modernise the infrastructure to offer increased interoperability with the
whole of the trans-European rail network, Eurotunnel has installed GSM-R (Global System for Mobile Communications –
Railway), a ground to train radio communications network in the Tunnel.


-----

**ii)** **Terminals**

Currently, 10 boarding platforms are in service at the French terminal and 10 at the British terminal. Both terminals were
designed so that the number of boarding platforms could be increased to 16 at each terminal.

Eurotunnel’s current strategy is to optimise the reliability of loading and unloading times to increase frequency using the
existing platforms.

Within the context of Brexit, the Group has worked closely with the relevant authorities to set up differentiated routes and
to adapt the facilities to the specific needs of the various controls. The investments made can be divided into three main
categories:

an overhaul of the inbound and outbound freight checks (Pit-Stop) with associated IT developments (Eurotunnel Border
Pass) and the installation of Parafe gates for passenger checks;

the construction of various facilities enabling the services of both States to fulfil their new control missions (SIVEP
Customs Centre and so on); and

the construction of a 276-space truck park at the French terminal to regulate truck traffic at the request of the authorities
(Traffic Management Plan - TMP).

The Group considers that part of these investments do not fall within the scope of its obligations as concession operator
and has requested that the authorities assume responsibility for them.

Eurotunnel has designed, in collaboration with the French Customs authorities, a smart border system to maintain the fluidity
of border crossings. This system consists of a notification system which allows the carrier to fill in, when registering his
journey in the Eurotunnel information system, the documents required by French customs before boarding. When the driver
enters the Pit-Stop and prior to boarding, the information collected will be transmitted in real time to the Customs’
information system in order to be reconciled with the customs formalities recorded by shippers in the information system.

For several years, number plate recognition has made it possible to avoid stopping at toll booths. More recently, an
innovative programme set up with the authorities has made it possible for drivers who wish to do so to no longer have to
stop each time to have their identity checked. As described in section 1.6.1 of this Universal Registration Document, the
Group benefits from the investments made with the support of the authorities to improve the effectiveness of border controls
including the introduction of a scanner for vans and a scanner for Rail Freight Services.

These developments have helped improve traffic flows and levels of security as well as the quality of service.

**b)** **Rolling stock**

In 2020, in the context of making major economies and the low levels of traffic volumes, it was decided to bring forward the
shutdown of one first generation ("Breda") Shuttle thereby reducing the fleet to 17 Shuttles in operation (five with a capacity
of 31 trucks and 12 with a capacity of 32 trucks). This fleet rationalisation was planned as part of the Shuttle fleet
modernisation project in which 6 Breda Shuttles are being replaced with new Shuttles with improved availability and lower
maintenance costs.

Eurotunnel has nine Passenger Shuttles each able to carry up to 180 cars or 120 cars and 12 coaches.

Planned changes in the Shuttle fleet are described in section 1.6.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

**c)** **Industrial maintenance facilities and equipment**

Eurotunnel uses a large number of service tracks and large industrial maintenance buildings (the F46 maintenance workshop
which is 800 metres long and accommodates two complete Shuttles side by side), which will be adapted to the new
maintenance technologies for the modernised trains and, if necessary, to the additional mileage travelled by the Shuttle
fleet.


-----

**1.2.4** **EUROTUNNEL: RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM**

From the outset, the Group has aimed for the highest level of System availability and safety through a policy of asset
simplification, sustained investment and demanding maintenance with an investment of more than one billion euros by the
Concessionaires since the start of operations in 1994.

**a)** **Maintenance strategy**

Eurotunnel’s digital vision includes two elements that directly relate to optimising maintenance:

optimising infrastructure and rolling stock management through the appropriate level of maintenance of the asset base
and data analysis: increasing the reliability and availability of infrastructure and rolling stock through predictive
maintenance, digitisation of teams on the ground and optimisation of planning schedules; and

building a global platform to enable collection, visualisation, analysis and prediction using reliable and secure data,
accessible to maintenance staff in real time.

**b)** **Maintenance and availability of the Tunnel**

Scheduled weekly maintenance of the Tunnel is planned and structured so as to promote efficient use of the Tunnel and
avoid disruption to commercial operations. In order to optimise infrastructure maintenance, it is envisaged that time spent
maintaining the two rail tunnels will be reduced through the use of digital inspection tools. Eurotunnel has invested in rapidaction cameras to inspect the track and catenary, which are used weekly in the Tunnel. This initial phase will be extended
with the acquisition of a measurement train specifically for use in the Tunnel. It will be used each week to deliver a very
accurate assessment of the condition of the track, catenary, electro-mechanical equipment and the civil engineering
infrastructure in order to eliminate the need for long visual inspections on foot and to strengthen the predictive maintenance
approach.

As in previous years, service disruptions due to fixed equipment failure remained insignificant and even decreased.

The operational plan aiming to limit fire risk (the Salamandre Plan) and the creation of fire-fighting (SAFE) stations contribute
to protecting the infrastructure in case of fire on board a Shuttle or a train. The Tunnel has rescue mission specialist teams
who patrol the service tunnel 24 hours a day. Since 2011, four SAFE stations have been operational in the Tunnel central
Intervals so that in the event of a fire on a Truck Shuttle, the 800-metre long train can rapidly reach one of these stations.
The Tunnel is the only infrastructure of its type in the world equipped with a system of this kind.

In order to test response plans for the emergency services and successful coordination in the event of an accident in the
Tunnel, the Group and the public authorities organise an annual major full-scale safety exercise: the Binat (as in binational).
The latest Binat, held in January 2020, was the 30[th] since the construction of the Tunnel and the 24[th] since the opening of
commercial services in 1994.

,As part of its multi-year plan to reinforce the catenary that supplies the power required to operate the Shuttles and trains
circulating in the rail tunnels, Eurotunnel completed the installation of new synthetic isolators to improve the operating
availability of the electrical power supply in 2019.

Rails at the terminals are replaced as part of the routine maintenance programme, without major disruption to commercial
services. The strategy implemented has reduced costs without harming the quality of the track.

**c)** **Rolling stock maintenance and availability**

The process of optimising the rolling stock maintenance strategy aims to:

improve the availability, performance and quality of the Shuttles;

increase processing capacity and so optimise the total cost of maintenance; and

rationalise technical choices and industrial resources.

This process is based on several workstreams:

optimisation of the organisation of Truck Shuttles maintenance in order to limit the use of those Shuttles that are the
most expensive to maintain (the Breda type) during the decommissioning process;

desaturation of the train maintenance industrial tool by optimising the usage of the short-term maintenance workshop,
by concentrating the programmed activities on one Shuttle at a time;

technical redesign of maintenance on systems that have a high impact on performance and quality, focussing on the
relevance of maintenance instructions and the implementation of appropriate large-scale maintenance programmes; and

optimisation of key processes such as corrective maintenance, re-profiling and axle replacement, and including
improvement in the efficiency of human, industrial and IT resources.


-----

Eurotunnel seeks to make the best use of its transport capacity by improving the load factor and availability of its rolling
stock by adapting its maintenance processes. Measures implemented in 2020 and 2019 enabled lost capacity due to the
non-availability of rolling stock to be reduced by 58% for Truck Shuttles and 35% for Passenger Shuttles compared to 2018:

Shuttle availability and capacity was improved thanks to improved responsiveness. Planning scenarios were tested to free
up tracks in the maintenance workshops before and during periods of high demand and speed up the technical repair
of Shuttles.

Preventive measures were organised occasionally on a single track, to free up a track for maintenance and targeted
repairs.

Eurotunnel’s repair and maintenance programmes have helped to improve the reliability of the electric locomotives and
Truck and Passenger Shuttles. In planning its maintenance programme, Eurotunnel’s objectives are to:

ensure that safety requirements are met;

avoid rolling stock being out of service for prolonged periods; and

maximise the number of Shuttles available at peak hours.

Under current maintenance programmes, light maintenance and safety inspections are carried out every 44 days or 30,000
km for the locomotives, Truck Shuttles and Passenger Shuttles. Every 600 to 1,200 days, depending on the type of equipment
and the number of kilometres it has covered, each piece of equipment is taken out of service for one to six weeks to undergo
an extensive preventive maintenance programme.

The goal of the large-scale maintenance programme is to:

meet safety requirements (e.g. bogies, brakes, couplings and batteries);

restore and improve the reliability of systems (e.g. canopies and hydraulics on single deck loaders);

extend the life of wagons (e.g. floors);

ensure customer comfort (e.g. air conditioning, toilets and interiors); and

perform work requiring down time and specific equipment.
Eurotunnel is implementing simplification and renovation programmes aimed at further reducing future maintenance
requirements and improving reliability of rolling stock.

**1.3** **EUROPORTE ACTIVITIES**

**1.3.1** **EUROPORTE’S MAIN MARKETS**

According to data published by the French Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition[11], the French rail freight industry
in 2019 was once again impacted by strikes, with an overall volume of 31.8 billion tonne kilometres, a decrease of 0.8%
compared to 2018 following the 4.6% decrease in 2018 compared to 2017. The market in 2020 was affected firstly by the
SNCF Réseau strikes which continued until 13 January 2020 and then by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic from midMarch 2020. Europorte transported 1.7 billion tonne kilometres in 2020, down 4% compared to 2019, representing an
estimated market share of 6%.

**1.3.2** **EUROPORTE’S ACTIVITIES**

Due to its dense coverage in France and its capacity to serve industrial sites in Belgium and Germany, Europorte is positioned
as a growth vehicle for the Group. It operates across the entire rail freight transport logistics chain, from collecting and
routing on primary and secondary networks (Europorte France) to loading and unloading of wagons on private branch lines
on industrial sites (Socorail) and managing rail infrastructure (ports, private and public/private industrial sites) in France.
Europorte is developing its various complementary activities concurrently in order to offer its customers complete and
customised solutions that meet their expectations for integrated logistics chains and high quality of service.

Europorte’s revenues were impacted by the effects of the SNCF strikes and the Covid-19 pandemic during the first half of
2020 (-12% compared to the first half of 2019) but recovered in the second half to near pre-Covid-19 levels of activity. Thanks
to a good sector positioning and a very limited exposure to intermodal transport, revenue generated by Europorte’s activities
in 2020 decreased by only 2% compared to 2019, to €123 million, helped by the growth in cross-border transport flows
between France, Belgium and Germany. The increase in the proportion of the Group’s consolidated revenues generated by
the Europorte segment from 12% in 2019 to 15% in 2020 reflects the fact that Europorte was less severely impacted by the
Covid-19 pandemic than the Eurotunnel segment. Nevertheless, Europorte had to put some of its staff on a short-time work
scheme for a brief period of time following the shutdown of certain industrial sites, notably automotive and cement plants.

**a)** **Europorte France (EPF)**

Europorte France is a private rail company that offers its customers a service hauling goods trains throughout the railway
network. Every day, EPF carries out main line rail haulage operations 24 hours a day and seven days a week throughout
France. It also provides connections to neighbouring European countries, in partnership or as an open access operator,
particularly in Belgium where EPF has its own railway authorisations (licence and certificate).

In order to haul 172 commercial trains per week in 2020, Europorte has a fleet of 72 main line electric and diesel locomotives
which are interoperable with neighbouring European countries. They are operated on average by around 290 drivers and
agents authorised for safety operations on the French railway network and, in some cases, in Belgium.

EPF has designed its operating model based on six key parameters, specifically with a view to serving its private industrial
customers:

optimisation of transport plans based on regular paths;

organisation of the rail businesses through regional hubs;

guaranteed service through the provision of reliable human and other resources dedicated to traffic;

regular and punctual delivery of goods;

safety on customers’ private branch lines and on the national railway network; and

communication on the status of customers’ freight traffic.

Since 31 March 2006, rail freight transport (international and domestic freight) has been fully open to competition in France,
in application of European texts (the “railway packages” presented in chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document). To
be able to operate on the French rail network, Railway Companies must have:

a European rail freight company licence issued by their country of establishment (by the Ministry of Transport for French
companies) or by another Member State of the European Union. This licence certifies that the undertaking meets a
minimum requirement in terms of good reputation, financial standing and professional competence, as well as civil
liability cover;

and a safety certificate for the lines on which the operator wishes to operate issued by the National Safety Authority
(ANS): the Établissement Public de Sécurité Ferroviaire (EPSF) in France.

Europorte transports all types of goods, with the exception of explosive, nuclear and biological materials. Its entire operating
system is designed in accordance with the rules on transporting dangerous goods in order to maximise the safety of its
operations. In 2018 and 2019, Europorte consolidated its petrochemical and cement segments with new key contracts on
behalf of major industrial customers. This sectoral positioning has enabled Europorte to weather the public health crisis in
2020 with a very limited impact on its business. This year was also marked by the continued development of Europorte's
cross-border flows to Belgium and Germany, in line with its growth strategy.

EPF further diversified the goods that it transports in order to balance out the risk of seasonal fluctuations in the volumes
transported. EPF has also continued to consolidate its rail business along France’s north/south corridor through its hubs. It
pursued the development of its range of one-off and last minute services (spot trains) and offered specific services in
response to the needs of customers in the agri-food sector to meet growing demand for seasonal transport requirements.
From March 2020, in the context of the fight against Covid-19, Europorte contributed to the hydroalcoholic gel production
chain with the transport of 250,000 tonnes of raw materials.

EPF also continues its freight forwarder business, mostly for grain transport.

All main line locomotives are equipped with GPS positioning and exchange all relevant technical data with the operating and
maintenance teams. The command post agents are able to display information on tablets such as the position of the train,
its schedule in relation to its paths, the battery condition and the amount of fuel in its tank. In turn, drivers are gradually
being equipped with tablets incorporating driving documents and traffic information (alert reports and so on).

**b)** **Socorail**

For more than 40 years, Socorail has been providing internal logistics services on industrial sites: wagon handling operations,
track maintenance, loading and unloading of wagons and trucks, and operations on ships. Socorail’s activities cover a range
of services to industry, mainly involving dispatch and reception of raw, semi-finished or finished products, and management
of rail infrastructure:

management of industrial sidings including reception, handling and dispatch of loaded or unloaded wagons and the
associated administrative processing;

loading or unloading wagons, particularly tank wagons;

terminal rail services in port zones and on the French railway network;

provision of rail haulage engines on a full service basis;

track maintenance;

traffic management of rail networks at various ports;

management of front offices and loading tracks for tank wagons;

operation of the port terminal for an oil refinery; and

ancillary services, including training in these activities.


-----

Socorail works at around 40 industrial sites and six ports, including around 20 sites classified as SEVESO II in the oil, chemicals,
steel making, automotive and construction material sectors. Socorail is MASE and ISO 9001 certified. Present throughout
France, Socorail manages wagons, trucks and operations on ships and port infrastructure.

Socorail is developing a service offering to rail infrastructure managers consisting of traffic management and railway
maintenance. In 2018, the company launched two new feeder lines maintenance operations, one in the Hauts-de-France
region for the regional council, and the other in the eastern France region for SNCF. In 2019, the company successfully
continued the development of its logistics business on industrial sites, with the start-up of two new contracts in the
petrochemical sector. 2020 was a year of continuity with the renewal of all of Socorail’s expired contracts, including a major
one for a period of seven years.

The delegated infrastructure management sector is Socorail’s largest business, accounting for 41% of its 2020 revenue,
followed by the oil/hydrocarbon refining sector at 22%. The chemicals, automobile and services to port terminals sectors
contributed 15%, 6% and 5% respectively.

**c)** **Europorte Proximité (EPP)**

Europorte Proximité, which hosts Europorte's low-power diesel locomotive maintenance activity, was merged into Socorail
with effect from 28 April 2020.

**d)** **Europorte Channel (EPC)**

In 2018, Europorte took over ground rail operations at the Calais-Fréthun site adjoining the Concession and is responsible
for managing cross-Channel rail freight traffic. Like all Railway Companies, Europorte pays the charge for the use of the Fixed
Link for any crossing through the Tunnel, as explained in section 1.2.2.b of this Universal Registration Document. This activity
therefore aims to contribute to the recovery of the cross-Channel rail freight business.

**e)** **Europorte TCSO (EPTCSO)**

At the beginning of 2016, Europorte created a subsidiary Europorte Terminal Container du Sud-Ouest, in order to manage
the container terminal at the Grand Port Maritime in Bordeaux, which, as explained in section 3.2.1.c of this Universal
Registration Document, has not come to pass.

**1.4** **ELECLINK ACTIVITIES**

Getlink seeks to further enhance its infrastructure by developing an electricity interconnector project installed in the Tunnel
linking the French and British grids. This will enable the import and export of electricity from one country to the other with
a bi-directional transmission capacity of 1GW via high-voltage direct current cabling installed in the north rail tunnel. Once
in service, ElecLink Limited will own the only fully private cross-Channel electricity interconnector benefitting from a 25-year
exemption from certain European regulations, namely article 17 of European Directive 714/2009, which has now been
replaced by article 63 of Regulation 2019/943 (the ‘‘European Union Electricity Regulation’’). This will enable Getlink to retain
the economic value generated by the asset subject to the profit-sharing mechanisms agreed under the exemption. ElecLink
will also play a key societal role by enhancing the integration of European power markets by optimising the dispatch of
installed generation capacity, including renewable energy sources, across both countries and securing affordable electricity
supplies to consumers. The entry into service of ElecLink mid-2022 is expected to represent a marked improvement in the
profitability of the Group.

Construction, which formally commenced at the end of 2016, was contracted to leading companies: Siemens for the two
converter stations in France and Great Britain and Balfour Beatty/Prysmian for the supply and installation of the direct current
cables in the Tunnel and the underground alternating current cable required to connect the ElecLink converter station to the
British high voltage grid at the National Grid ESO substation at Sellindge in Great Britain. In France, RTE has provided the
underground alternating current cables connecting the ElecLink converter station to the RTE “Les Mandarins” substation at
Bonningues-lès-Calais.

As at 31 December 2020, the following construction activities had been successfully completed:

construction of the two converter stations, including all civil and electromechanical works outside the Tunnel;

construction of a 14.5km system of underground alternating current cables in Great Britain between the ElecLink
converter station in Folkestone and the national grid substation in Sellindge;

manufacturing of the direct current cables;

enabling works inside the Tunnel consisting of a steel support structure for the cables (brackets fixed to the Tunnel lining
which support a monorail system); and

enabling works outside the Tunnel, including assembly facilities whereby the cables are assembled on a specially
designed helix to enable them to be pulled into the Tunnel on a monorail system.


-----

As discussed in detail in chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document, the construction, as with any new project, carries
risks related to technical implementation and compliance with performance levels as well as the commissioning schedule,
all within a regulatory context that may change.

In October 2020, the IGC gave consent to carrying out connection tests at the two converter stations: to the RTE network on
the French side and National Grid on the British side, according to established protocols and following site visits with the
emergency services. The testing phase on the French converter station was successfully completed in December 2020 and
the UK converter stations tests should be completed at the beginning of 2021.

The quality of the safety dossier prepared for the project enabled the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), the Channel
Tunnel Safety Authority to reinstate the project’s approval on 10 December. This will enable the completion of the
interconnector construction, following on from the completion of the testing of the converter stations.

Works on the cable pull started at the end of January 2021 and are expected to finish in summer 2021. The cable pull takes
place during scheduled maintenance nights in the North rail tunnel.

Following this work, an in-depth testing and commissioning phase will take place before commercial commissioning,
scheduled for mid-2022.

The exemption under the European Union Electricity Regulation required that the ElecLink interconnector become
operational no later than 31 July 2020. However, due to delays in receiving the IGC consent, certain construction activities
(i.e., the installation of the cables in the Tunnel) have been delayed and are yet to be concluded. On 11 June 2020, the
national regulators issued an opinion in favour of an initial five-month extension of the deadline for bringing the
interconnector into service, taking the deadline to 31 December 2020. This short-term extension would allow sufficient time
for the IGC to issue its decision and for the regulators to undertake an informed assessment of the request for an extension
of ElecLink’s exemption in the light of the IGC’s decision and the resulting timetable for the actual commissioning of the
interconnector. The European Commission issued its decision on 28 July 2020 confirming the extension of ElecLink’s
exemption until 31 December 2020 as proposed by the national regulators. Due to a late decision in December 2020 from
the IGC, following a positive opinion of the regulators, the European Commission has granted an extension of six months to
30 June 2021 to allow ElecLink to submit a final dossier for its further extension of the operational deadline.

Project investment totalled €74 million in 2020, bringing the total tangible asset on the consolidated statement of financial
position at 31 December 2020 to €679 million including the external construction costs, ancillary and intra-group project
and financing costs.

Once operational, ElecLink is expected to generate revenue for the Group from the sources:

Revenue from the auctioning of physical transmission rights. This is expected to be the primary source of revenue for
ElecLink and will provide electricity market participants (traders, generators and suppliers) the opportunity to purchase
up to 1,000MW of transmission capacity in either direction of flow. ElecLink is expected to offer both long-term (e.g.,
annual, seasonal, quarterly and monthly) and short-term (i.e. day ahead[12] and intraday) products. All products will be
made available to the market through open, transparent and non-discriminatory auction mechanisms in compliance with
the ElecLink Access Rules, which were approved by the national energy regulators, the Office of Gas and Electricity
Markets (Ofgem) in Great Britain and the Commission de régulation de l’énergie (CRE) in France, during the course of
2019. The ElecLink Access Rules set out the terms on which third parties can purchase and use transmission capacity on
the interconnector[13]. In addition, the Charging Methodology Statement for the ElecLink interconnector, which was also
approved by Ofgem in 2019, sets out the methods and principles on which charges for the use of the interconnector will
be based[14].

Revenue from the capacity markets in France[15] and Great Britain[16]. Through these national mechanisms (administered by
Réseau de transport d’électricité (RTE) in France and by National Grid ESO, the electricity system operator, in Great Britain)
electricity interconnectors are remunerated, alongside generators and other capacity providers, for their contribution to
security of supply either through the sale of capacity certificates to energy suppliers in France or through annual capacity
agreements awarded through auctions in Great Britain. In 2019, ElecLink entered into an agreement with RTE confirming
its participation in the French capacity market from 2021 but certified 0 MW for the 2021 delivery year as the
interconnector was scheduled to start operation after the delivery period.

12 Following the withdrawal of Great Britain from the European internal energy market, day-ahead products will be allocated through

explicit auctions until a regional day-ahead mechanism is put in place in accordance with the Trade & Cooperation Agreement entered
into between the European Union and Great Britain.
13 The ElecLink Access Rules applicable if Great Britain does not remain part of the European internal energy market after Brexit were

approved by CRE in October 2019 and by Ofgem in December 2019. The rules can be found at the following link:

14 The Charging Methodology Statement applicable following the withdrawal of Great Britain from the European internal energy market

after Brexit was approved by Ofgem in December 2019 and can be found at the following link:

-----

In Great Britain, ElecLink successfully participated in the 2018 “T-4” auction for the delivery period of October 2021 to
September 2022 and in the 2020 “T-3” and “T-4” for delivery periods from October 2022 to September 2023 and from
October 2023 to September 2024 respectively. ElecLink has therefore secured three capacity agreements equating to
£5.8 million for the 2018 “T-4” auction (at 2016/2017 values), to £4.83 million for the 2020 “T-3” auction (at 2017/2018
values) and £11.02 million for the 2020 “T-4” auction (at 2018/2019 values) respectively, being a total of approximately
£22 million. In addition, ElecLink prequalified successfully for the 2021 “T-4” auction for the period from October 2024
to September 2025 taking place in March 2021.

Revenue from the provision of ancillary services to the national Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in France and
Great Britain. These services facilitate short-term changes to the flow of energy over the interconnector and are used by
the national TSOs to ensure the security and quality of supply of electricity in their grids. They may include frequency
response services, provision of reactive power, emergency assistance, constraint management and intertripping among
other services which may be agreed from time to time between ElecLink and the national TSOs.
TSOs, including interconnector owners/operators, are obliged to respect independence rules aimed at achieving legal
and functional separation from companies exercising a production or supply activity as laid down in the French Energy
Code, the 1989 Electricity Act in the UK (“Electricity Act”) and European Directive 2019/944 of 5 June 2019 (“Electricity
Directive”). The effective legal and functional unbundling between the management and operation of transmission
networks and the activities of electricity production and supply has the ultimate aim of avoiding any risk of discrimination
between the users of the transmission network. A formal certification procedure, overseen by the national regulatory
authorities for energy and the European Commission, aims to ensure that the rules relating to independence are
respected. On 31 January and 11 February 2019 respectively, CRE and Ofgem decided to grant certification to ElecLink
(in accordance with article R. 111-5 of the French Energy Code[17] and section 10D of the Electricity Act[18] in the UK) under
the full ownership unbundling model.

**1.5** **GETLINK ACTIVITIES**

The Getlink segment encompasses the Group’s corporate services including strategy, mergers and acquisitions, finance, legal,
corporate communication, talent management, CSR as well as the activities of Getlink SE, the Group’s parent company, and
those of its direct subsidiaries including the CIFFCO railway training centre.

Getlink SE coordinates and monitors the implementation of the global strategy while ensuring that the subsidiaries comply
with Group policies. Getlink SE is responsible for corporate functions, the dissemination of best practices and high valueadded cross-functional initiatives such as digital and innovation. It steers the Group's major transformation projects and
ensures their successful implementation within the Group.

**Training activity: CIFFCO, the Opal Coast international railway training centre**

CIFFCO is a railway training centre and is a technical resource to support the Group’s growth as the Tunnel Concessionaire
and a railway business. The CIFFCO training centre is open to all rail operators, infrastructure managers and industrial
companies for the training of their staff, enabling stakeholders to benefit from the Group’s expertise as described in chapter
6 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Property business: Euro-Immo GET**

As an extension of its mission to design and operate the Fixed Link as described in section 1.2.2.c above, the Group was
given responsibility for local land development.

As part of this responsibility and in order to further boost the appeal of the Calais area as a tourist destination, Getlink SE’s
subsidiary Euro-Immo GET SAS was awarded on 18 February 2013 the land development concession for the integrated
seaside eco-village and golf resort project at the Porte des Deux Caps. The development of this area entrusted to Euro-Immo
GET SAS, the project supervisor, encompasses all the work relating to roads, networks, open spaces and various facilities
designed to meet the needs of the future occupiers, owners, inhabitants and users of new buildings. Euro-Immo GET SAS
will manage the development of the assets until they are transferred to the builders. The concession will last for 10 years.

On 12 July 2013, the declaration of public utility for the project was granted by a prefectoral order for a five-year period,
which was then subsequently extended on 28 June 2018 for a further five-year period. GDEAM-62 (Groupement de défense
de l’Environnement de l’Arrondissement de Montreuil-sur-Mer, a group created to protect the environment in the Montreuilsur-Mer district) filed an objection with the Administrative Court of Lille on 20 January 2014 seeking the cancellation of that
order. In a ruling of 24 January 2017, the court dismissed the objection as unfounded. However, following an appeal by
GDEAM-62, on 3 July 2019, the Administrative Appeal Court of Douai cancelled the lower court’s judgment and accepted
GDEAM-62’s claims by cancelling both the prefectoral order of 12 July 2013 and the implicit decision to dismiss its appeal.
The Ministère de la cohésion des territoires et des relations avec les collectivités territoriales (the French Ministry of Territorial
Cohesion and Territorial Communities Relationships) appealed to the Conseil d’État on 28 August 2019 against this appeal
decision and Euro-Immo GET also filed an appeal on 3 September 2019 and made a supplementary submission on 3
December 2019. On 22 July 2020, the Conseil d’État rejected those appeals. As at the date of this Universal Registration
Document, the Group is analysing its options.

-----

**Rail transport: Euro Carex**

The Group is involved in the Euro Carex project via its subsidiary London Carex Limited. The Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Lyon
Saint Exupéry and Liège airports have linked up with logistics companies including FedEx and TNT to try to encourage a
transfer of air freight onto the European high-speed railway network. London Carex is part of this umbrella organisation, the
Euro Carex association, tasked with developing the British end of the network. The Carex concept is similar to a cargo aircraft
running on rail: high-speed trains that have been modified to carry air freight containers. In 2017, the association launched
a tender for a European business plan. The study began in 2017 and confirmed the existence of a market. Initial contacts
made in Germany were continued. The recent debates on the carbon footprint generated by air transport have boosted the
interest of airports and freight-forwarders in this project to transfer air freight onto the European high-speed railway network.
In addition, the Covid-19 crisis has shown the importance of air freight for the world’s economy. Rail freight has been far
less affected than passenger transport: these are both very favourable factors for this project.

In 2018, Trenitalia launched a service based on the same concept as Carex between northern and southern Italy. Carex has
made a number of contacts, with a view to Trenitalia becoming part of the project. The French government has expressed
its interest in the project, which fits in perfectly with its desire to transfer short and medium-haul flights to rail. The association
is updating its business plan.

In 2020, Lyon airport became a direct member of Euro Carex and Groupe ADP (Paris airports) have stated their intention to
do the same in 2021, which demonstrates their commitment to the project.

**Rail transport: safety and control of people flows**

Getlink is working on a joint venture project to develop global solutions and automated control devices for land and rolling
stock.

**Regional passenger rail transport: Régionéo**

On 15 September 2020, RATP Dev and Getlink formally created a joint stock company (RDGL Rail SAS) to jointly respond to
calls for tender for regional passenger rail transport as part of the opening up of the rail market to competition in France.

The new French joint venture (55% RATP Dev, 45% Getlink) called Régionéo combines the expertise of its two shareholders
– both major players in passenger transport and rail transport - to respond to the needs of the regions by offering tailormade and innovative rail services and meet the highest standards of operational excellence and quality of service for
passengers.

Régionéo is led by Ronan Bois, chairman, and Raphaël Doutrebente, chief operating officer, a pair of experienced managers
from RATP Dev and Getlink respectively.

**1.6** **MAJOR INVESTMENTS**

**1.6.1** **MAJOR INVESTMENTS**

Productivity, punctuality, reliability, adaptability, safety and respect for the environment are the investment programme’s
guiding principles. More broadly, as part of a collaborative dynamic, Eurotunnel’s medium-term focus is in the following
projects that seek to reinvigorate and improve the operational profitability of assets used in operations and to contribute to
the reduction of CO2 emissions per unit transported:

Simplifying and optimising operating conditions throughout the customer journey, placing the safety of people, control
of operating processes and improvement of the customer experience at the centre of the Group’s requirements, while
also taking into account the changes in administrative formalities linked to Brexit.

Digitalising and automating processes to improve the customer experience, increasing the fluidity of service and
improving maintenance of the Tunnel and its equipment.

Optimising the operational availability of infrastructure and rolling stock, through a quality policy and achieving a
significant improvement in the RAMS indicators (reliability, availability, maintainability and safety) in the market: in
particular, the first generation Truck Shuttles will be replaced by a new generation of Shuttles that are simpler and more
reliable, then the Truck Shuttle Club-Cars will be replaced and the Passenger Shuttles will be modernised by improving
the availability of critical equipment such as air conditioning, fire doors and converters.

Simplifying and optimising the operating performance of the Truck Shuttle service by generating gains through the
Simply Better Freight programme (as set out in section 1.2.2.a.i above) through universal services and solutions. In this
regard, the Truck Shuttle operating fleet will be standardised by installing four pagodas to increase the load factor,
simplifying and improving the reliability of pre-departure technical checks.

Simplifying loading conditions for Passenger Shuttles in real-time to improve the load factor, mainly through the use of
digital tools (SmartLoading).

Promoting optimisation of the load factor by strengthening the flexible pricing system according to anticipated load
factors for both Truck Shuttles and Passenger Shuttles.

Increasing transport capacity by making Shuttle maintenance cycle times more reliable and limiting production losses by
seeking to:

   - reduce transit times by speeding up Shuttle departures and installing Automatic Train Operation (ATO) with an ETCS
(European Train Control System); and


-----

   - and controlling customer loading and unloading times.

Improving operational security (by the installation of the four pagodas and better safety in the Tunnel if smoke is detected
using ATO).

The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the working environment of Eurotunnel’s team members, as well as that of its
customers. A number of measures were taken very quickly by Eurotunnel to ensure the highest level of health protection,
including:

the enhancement of protection facilities on board Club-Cars, which are now fully equipped with plexiglas separating lorry
drivers; and

temporary and permanent facilities facilitating social distancing and staff flows within the passenger, maintenance and
office buildings within the Concession, such as, in particular, the enlargement of the collective catering areas, the
installation of plexiglas and floor markings and the provision of masks and hydroalcoholic gel.

In order to minimise the effects of the crisis on its results and prepare for recovery, in 2020 Getlink decided to be more
selective in its annual investment programme in addition to its 2020 cost reduction programme.

**a)** **Major investments over the last three years**

The Group’s investments in the last three years total €284 million for the 2018 financial year, €244 million for the 2019
financial year and €156 million for the 2020 financial year.

Over the last three financial years, the Group has invested more than €246 million in Eurotunnel, including:

The Brexit preparation programme and the “smart border” project comprising:

   - the construction of infrastructure to accommodate the French State service responsible for performing checks:
customs checks and veterinary checks which require inspection by SIVEP (the French veterinary and phytosanitary
service);

   - the construction of a Rail Freight Services scanner on the SNCF Réseau tracks at the Calais Fréthun site. This scanner
reduces the time necessary for border controls by customs officials in Fréthun, thus improving the quality and
competitiveness of cross-Channel rail freight in the context of Brexit;

   - the commissioning of facial recognition PARAFE (automated fast-track crossing at external borders) gates, the result
of work carried out under the auspices of the French Interior Ministry and financed by Eurotunnel; this high-tech
investment, which uses state-of-the-art technology, will make it easier for coach passengers holding biometric
passports to cross the border;

   - the construction of an export truck park and the “Truck Village”, which allows Truck Shuttle customers to deal with
the administrative and customs procedures needed post 1 January and also offers lorry drivers various services in an
environment fully adapted to the current health context;

   - the creation of Pit-Stops in France and the United Kingdom combining the safety and security checks and migrant
checks for trucks; and

   - the creation of a reception area in the Folkestone terminal passenger building for customers travelling with pets to
facilitate controls related to entry into the European Union.

The Passenger Shuttle fleet renovation programme.

The strengthening of the electrical traction network by building a new booster converter twice as powerful as the existing
one and increasing the capacity of the catenary by adding high-tension co-axial cables in a project to be continued in
2021.

The programme to standardise the Truck Shuttle fleet, including the programme to install pagodas on the secondgeneration Truck Shuttles and the launch of the programme to renew the Breda Shuttles.

In the last three financial years, the Group’s investments for the Europorte segment totalled around €8 million, essentially
relating to the refurbishment of locomotives.

Between taking full control of ElecLink in 2016 and 31 December 2020, the Group invested €663 million in the ElecLink
project (of which €423 million was in the last three financial years). These amounts include the external construction costs
(EPC contracts, engineering studies, construction works, connections and project management costs), other capitalised costs
related to the project (such as personnel, office space, IT, professional fees and insurance) as well as intragroup costs for
financing and access fees to the Tunnel.


-----

On 9 February 2018, as part of the Group’s strategy to optimise its financing structure, a UK subsidiary of Getlink SE,
Eurotunnel Agent Services Limited, purchased the Channel Link Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF) G2 notes for a consideration
of £359 million. This transaction is described in notes A.2.1, D.8 and G.7 to the consolidated financial statements in section
2.2.1 of the 2018 Registration Document.

**b)** **Major future investments**

**Current investment projects**

The Group is facing investment needs over the next 7 to 10 years to enable it to continue renewing and modernising the
Fixed Link equipment and infrastructure that have been in operation for 26 years. This investment programme is a key
element in achieving the Group's long-term strategic objectives in terms of operational and commercial excellence and
financial performance. With this in mind, and in order to preserve its cash position in the context of the public health crisis,
the Group has decided to optimise its capital expenditure in 2020 and 2021 by postponing certain major projects while
giving priority to projects necessary for safety, continuity of operations and Brexit. The Group plans to resume these
renovation and replacement projects, the launch of which has been postponed, from 2022 onwards.

Eurotunnel’s planned investment projects have these two objectives, while continually seeking sustainable and innovative
solutions:

to modernise existing equipment before it becomes obsolete; and

to improve productivity and the quality of service.

All the projects have a degree of flexibility in terms of scope and phasing which may be adjusted as circumstances change.
In the current context, these investments help to prepare for the future and so maintain the competitiveness of Eurotunnel’s
activities.

In the next few years, the replacement projects mainly concern rolling stock. Intensive use and the natural life cycle of rolling
stock lead to deterioration in some of the wagon equipment. To remedy this, several modernisation and replacement
programmes have been launched, such as the Passenger Shuttle technical and aesthetic renovation programme. The firstgeneration Truck Shuttle renovation programme is ongoing. A new generation of Club-Cars, the vehicles in which truck
drivers travel during the crossing, is under consideration.

The renewal of infrastructure equipment is being prepared, particularly in the track areas (replacement of rails in the Tunnel,
replacement of the most commonly-used track equipment) and safety (modernisation of fire detection in the Tunnel).

For infrastructure maintenance, the programme to replace the modules making up the works trains and the locomotives
used to transport them through the Tunnel is ongoing with a view to optimising the operational availability of the tunnels
and contributing to the CSR air pollution reduction targets.

As part of service quality improvement measures, the programme to improve the electrical power supply will continue.
Studies prior to the deployment of ETCS (European Train Control System) rail signalling technology have been launched,
with the aim of thoroughly modernising the Tunnel's operating conditions and modes of operation.

More generally, the continuation of the digital transformation programme aims to bring greater transparency to traffic flows,
improve the customer experience and optimise the management of maintenance with increasingly efficient hypervision tools,
which will allow the real-time exploitation of thousands of datapoints in order to detect equipment drift and failure in
advance of it happening.

In addition to these current investments, there are also investments related to the ElecLink project. Based on the date of
entry into service of the ElecLink electrical in mid-2022, the estimated external construction costs of the ElecLink project,
from the time the Group took 100% control in August 2016 until the expected end of construction, are estimated at €665
million at the current exchange rate. This amount includes the additional costs generated by the delay in the ElecLink project
as described in section 1.4 above, mainly related to the late decision issued by the IGC regarding the installation of the cable
in the Tunnel. This sum corresponds to the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts as described in
section 1.4 above and covers technological architecture solutions and the completion of construction works as well as the
research and connections to national grids and project management. To those external construction costs, the various
associated external costs which are directly linked to the project such as personnel, offices, IT, professional fees and insurance
costs) are added, which increases estimated external project costs up to around €752 million (excluding intra-Group costs
relating to financing and Tunnel access).


-----

**Sources of funds for future investments**

As indicated in sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of this Universal Registration Document, the Group has available cash balances of
€629 million at 31 December 2020 and, under normal conditions in 2019, the Group generated free cash flow of more than
€240 million. The main future investments for the Fixed Link are expected to be self-funded. As at 31 December 2020, the
balance on the “Capex Reserve” account earmarked to finance long-term investment projects, such as those described above,
was €35 million.

Acquisitions of rolling stock for Europorte may be funded by external loans or sale and leaseback transactions.

In October 2018, Getlink SE issued the 2023 Green Bonds for a total principal amount of €550 million. This was increased in
October 2020 to €700 million with the issue of the 2025 Green Bonds. The issue proceeds were partly allocated to the ElecLink
project financing as well as other environmentally-friendly projects. As at 31 December 2020, a total of €613 million had
been spent on the selected projects. This corresponds to 92% of the 2025 Green Bond net proceeds of €670 million in the
following proportions:

clean transport: 50% (of which 31% for refinancing and 19% for Eurotunnel upgrade projects);

energy efficiency: 38% (of which 38% for ElecLink);

pollution prevention and control, fight against climate change: 3% (Eurotunnel upgrade projects).

The remaining €57 million will be used in 2021 to complete projects that were not finalised in 2020, including ElecLink.

The actions implemented as part of the Green Bonds refinancing are described in chapter 6 of this Universal Registration
Document.

**Other investment projects**

The new rail transport projects are presented in section 1.5 of this Universal Registration Document.

**1.6.2** **TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENCES**

**Trademarks and domain names**

The Group’s main trademarks are the nominative, figurative and semi figurative trademarks that protect the “Eurotunnel”
name and the design of the logo as well as “Getlink”. The other trademarks used are registered mainly to protect the
corporate names of the Group companies, such as “France Manche”, “Europorte” or “ElecLink”, and certain brand names,
such as “Le Shuttle” and “Flexiplus”.

In addition, at 31 December 2020 the Group also owns 415 domain names, including “eurotunnel.com” and
“getlinkgroup.com”.

**Patents**

The Group has also filed patents relating to specific aspects of its business.

At the date of this Universal Registration Document, two systems, including that relating to the SAFE stations, are the subject
of patents in force filed by FM. Two other patents have been filed by FM, one for sleeper block measuring equipment and
the other concerning boarding cards. A patent has also been filed by Getlink SE for a vehicle-based document data
acquisition and control system.

**Licences**

The Group has no licence granted by a third party allowing it to use third party industrial property rights. It has granted a
non-exclusive licence to use the “auto convergent maintenance system for complex high-volume equipment” patent. Intragroup brand licences have been put in place with the subsidiaries concerned.

**2.1** **ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS**

The following information relating to Getlink SE’s financial situation and consolidated results must be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements set out in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

The main factors with an impact on revenue are described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Accounting standards applied[19] and presentation of the consolidated results**

Pursuant to EC Regulation 297/2008 of 11 March 2008 on the application of international accounting standards, the
consolidated financial statements of Getlink SE for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union at 31 December 2020.

**Preparation of the consolidated annual financial statements in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic**

The Covid-19 virus outbreak, which appeared in China in December 2019 and was designated as a pandemic by the World
Health Organization on 11 March 2020, led to the introduction of numerous restrictive measures in many countries
throughout 2020.

As indicated in this section and in notes A.1 and D.9 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal
Registration Document, the periodic traffic restrictions and containment measures imposed by the French and British
governments between March and December 2020 had a significant impact on the Group‘s traffic and revenues during 2020,
and in particular on those of Eurotunnel.

In the first half of 2020, the general containment measures imposed in France and the United Kingdom between March and
May for France and between March and early July for the United Kingdom followed by the implementation by the British
government from mid-June of quarantine for almost all persons entering its territory, had a significant impact on the activities
of Passenger Shuttles and Eurostar trains. The temporary lifting of this quarantine in July and the first part of August enabled
the Passenger Shuttle service to regain some of its summer seasonal traffic, but its reintroduction from mid-August, together
with the new containment measures imposed in Europe and the United Kingdom in the last quarter of 2020 and the border
crossing restrictions introduced by the French government in December had a significant impact on Eurotunnel's traffic and
revenues over the entire period.

Compared to 2019, Passenger Shuttle traffic fell by 47% in 2020 for the year as a whole: after a 73% decline between March
and June, the summer period saw a significant recovery in traffic, before the impact of the new quarantine and containment
measures was felt from September until the end of the year.

Eurostar was forced to massively reduce its timetable throughout the year, resulting in a 77% drop in the number of
passengers using trains passing through the Tunnel over the year as a whole.

The Truck Shuttle activity was less affected by the public health crisis than Eurotunnel’s other activities due to a certain level
of economic activity in Europe being maintained and the need to ensure the flow of essential goods. In addition, it benefited
in the last quarter of the year from the effect of stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit Transition Period on 31 December
2020. This positive trend was nevertheless strongly impacted at the end of the year by the border crossing restrictions
imposed by the French government from 20 December onwards. After a decline of 18% in the first half of the year, Truck
Shuttle traffic was down 9% for year as a whole.

Total revenue from Eurotunnel activities decreased by 27% in 2020 compared to 2019.

Europorte’s business, which was impacted at the beginning of the year by the national strikes against pension reform in
France, declined again between March and June, when the measures taken in response to the public health crisis affected
traffic in the automobile, cement and quarry sectors, and to a lesser extent the oil and gas sector. In the second half of the
year, Europorte's business activity returned to its pre-crisis level and the decline in its revenue over 2020 was limited to 2%.

19 The Group has applied IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” to its maritime segment since the

cessation of MyFerryLink’s operations in the second half of 2015. Accordingly, the net result of this segment for the current and previous
financial years is presented as a single line in the income statement called “Net profit from discontinued operations”. More information
is given in note C.2 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 to this Universal Registration Document.


-----

Faced with this situation, the Group took a series of measures to ensure the health and safety of its customers and personnel
whilst ensuring the continuation of movement of goods and people and preserving its profitability and cash flow capabilities:

The Group immediately took the necessary measures to ensure the protection of its employees and the continuity of
essential functions, the cost of which was approximately €3 million in 2020. A continuous monitoring system was set up
in consultation with staff representatives.

The Group adapted its Shuttle capacity and operating plans in response to the decline in traffic while implementing
specific measures to ensure the health and safety of its customers and maintain the quality of its service. As part of the
schemes put in place by the French and British governments, the Group implemented furloughing measures for part of
its workforce in France and in the United Kingdom, initially between March and June and then again from October
onwards. The Group also launched a cost reduction plan to limit its expenses to what is strictly necessary. All of these
measures were still in force at the end of the year.

Europorte put in place similar measures during the first half of 2020 by adapting its capacities to the decline in traffic
and implementing a furlough scheme for some of its staff between March and June.

Executive officers, members of the Board and of the management team also decided to reduce their remuneration during
the periods most affected by the crisis.

In the context of the economic uncertainty caused by the crisis, and faced with the unavailability of its teams and certain
suppliers, the Group postponed a significant portion of its capital expenditure planned for 2020 whilst ensuring that
neither the safety nor the continuity of operations of its services were impacted.

On 3 April 2020, the Group announced the withdrawal of its proposal to distribute its 2019 dividend.

Other than the furloughing measures, the Group has limited its recourse to other aid and financial measures put in place by
the governments to help companies during the crisis. Nevertheless, like most players in the international transport sector,
the Group has requested a deferral of the payment of its business rates from the British government. At the balance sheet
date, the government has not responded to this request.

As indicated in note D.9 to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document,
the Group estimates the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its EBITDA for 2020 to be approximately €250 million compared
to the objective for 2020 published by the Group in February 2020.

The reduced activity in 2020 has impacted the Group's results and cash flow. Nevertheless, it has continued to honour its
debt service obligations during the year and continues to have significant liquidity, with net cash available at 31 December
2020 of €629 million.

**2.1.1** **ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT**

In order to enable a better comparison between the two years, the 2019 consolidated income statement presented in this
section has been recalculated at the exchange rate used for the 2020 income statement of £1=€1.126.

**Summary**

In 2020, the Group’s consolidated revenues were severely impacted by the effects of the pandemic and amounted to €816
million, a decrease of €264 million (-24%) compared to 2019. Operating costs totalled €488 million, a decrease of €35 million
(-7%) compared to 2019 as a result of the measures put in place by the Group to limit the impact of the pandemic on its
results, such as the implementation of partial activity in France and a job retention scheme in the UK as well as postponing
certain projects. The impact on EBITDA was consequently limited to a decrease of €229 million (-41%), to €328 million and
the trading profit decreased by €233 million to €142 million. At €134 million, the operating profit for 2020 was down by €271
million compared to 2019 (down by €233 million after excluding a one-off income of €38 million recorded in 2019). Net
finance costs (including net other financial income and charges) increased by €3 million compared to the previous year. The
pre-tax result for the Group’s continuing operations was a loss of €121 million for the 2020 financial year, down by €274
million compared to 2019 (of which €38 million was due to the one-off income recorded in 2019).

After taking into account a net profit from discontinued activities of €8 million, the Group’s net consolidated result for the
2020 financial year was a loss of €113 million, down by €269 million compared to the profit of €156 million in 2019 (down
by €231 million excluding the €38 million one-off income recorded in 2019).

The public health crisis and the strict lockdown measures taken by governments have had a serious impact on traffic and
the organisation of Eurotunnel's activities throughout 2020. Since mid-March, Eurotunnel has experienced a very sharp drop
in traffic, particularly for Passenger Shuttles and the number of Eurostar passengers. The Truck Shuttle business has also
recorded a considerable decrease in traffic, although less marked than other sectors due to the need to maintain the supply
flows of essential goods.

An increase in ticket yields, due in particular to the type of tickets booked (flexible, last-minute), partially mitigated the effect
of the significant decline in cross-Channel markets resulting from the pandemic and its impact on traffic volumes and on
Shuttle Services’ revenue which at €521 million for 2020, was down by 17% compared to the previous year.


-----

Truck Shuttle

Until the end of February 2020, Truck Shuttle traffic was down 9% compared to 2019 due to the unfavourable base effect
resulting from the stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit at the beginning of 2019. From mid-March onwards, certain market
sectors, notably industry and more specifically the automotive sector, were strongly impacted by the consequences of the
strict containment measures and other travel restrictions imposed by governments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Other sectors have been more resilient, such as food, pharmaceuticals and e-commerce. As a result, Truck Shuttle traffic was
down 28% in the second half of March, 34% in April and 29% in May. Starting in June, the first effects of the gradual lifting
of certain containment measures were felt with a reduction in traffic limited to 11% for the month and then to -6% for July
and August, but +2% for September. However, the exceptional increase in volume observed in October 2019 in anticipation
of the start of Brexit on 31 October 2019 explains the 7% decline in traffic in October 2020. From November 2020 onwards,
traffic benefited from a significant impact from stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit Transition Period on 31 December
2020. In a Short Straits cross-Channel truck market that contracted by 6.9% in 2020, the Truck Shuttle Service’s share of the
market was at 39.5% compared to 40.4% in 2019. In 2020, the number of trucks transported by Eurotunnel decreased by 9%
compared to 2019, to 1,451,556.

Passenger Shuttle

Measures put in place by governments from mid-March to limit the spread of the pandemic included the closure of
international borders for non-essential travel. As a result, the level of tourist traffic on the Passenger Shuttle Service dropped
very significantly from that date: a 75% drop in the second half of March compared to 2019, then of 91% in April, 81% in
May and 69% in June. The temporary lifting of the UK’s first quarantine period in July and the first part of August enabled
the Passenger Shuttle Service's car business to regain some of its seasonal summer traffic, but the reintroduction of
quarantine measures from mid-August, as well as the new containment measures imposed in Europe and the United
Kingdom in the last quarter of 2020 and the border crossing restrictions introduced by the French government in December
had a significant impact on Eurotunnel's car traffic over the entire period.

Whilst the Short Straits car market declined by 56.2% in 2020, Eurotunnel’s car market share, which benefited from the health
safety advantages recognised by customers who travel in their own vehicle throughout the journey with minimal contact
with other people, improved by 13.2 points compared to the previous year to 70.1%. Eurotunnel’s Passenger Shuttle car
activity carried 1,399,051 vehicles in 2020, down by 46%.

The Short Straits coach market contracted by 78.9% in 2020 but the Passenger Shuttle’s coach market share increased
compared to the previous year, to 54.9% (2019: 40.5%).

** Rail freight services by train operators (DB Cargo for BRB, SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Rail Operations Group, RailAdventure and Europorte)
using the Tunnel.

The Group earned revenues of €163 million in 2020 from the use of its Railway Network by Eurostar’s High-Speed Passenger
Trains and by Rail Freight Services, down by 48% compared to 2019 as a result of the impact of the public health crisis.

The impact of the epidemic on Eurostar traffic was seen as early as the beginning of March. Following the closure of borders
to non-essential travel in the middle of the month, the number of services was quickly reduced to two return trips per day
(London-Paris and London-Brussels) carrying only a few hundred passengers per day. Despite a very small uplift in activity
in July and August prior to the second period of quarantine for travellers to the UK from mid-August, passenger numbers
remain significantly impacted, with traffic in the last four months of 2020 down by 93% compared to the same period in
2019. For the year 2020, 2,503,419 Eurostar passengers used the Tunnel, down by 77% compared to 2019.

Cross-Channel rail freight has also been impacted by the crisis with the suspension of steel and then automobile flows. In
2020, the number of trains decreased by 19% compared to 2019.


-----

**ii)** **Eurotunnel operating costs**

In 2020, the Eurotunnel segment’s operating charges decreased by 7% compared with 2019 to €377 million. This decrease
of €27 million was mainly generated by the implementation of activité partielle in France and a Job Retention Scheme in the
United Kingdom for a significant portion of the workforce, as well as other measures to adjust the Shuttle capacity and
operating procedures, reduce other expenses and review the phasing of projects in order to preserve the Group's cash flow
capacity (significant reduction in the use of temporary staff and subcontractors, reduction in the use of spare parts and
marketing expenses).

**b)** **Getlink segment**

The Getlink segment includes the activities of the Group’s holding company, Getlink SE, as well as its direct subsidiaries
including the railway training centre CIFFCO.

For the 2020 financial year, the Getlink segment’s operating charges amounted to €15 million.

**Europorte segment**

The Europorte segment covers the entire rail freight transport logistics chain in France and includes notably Europorte France
and Socorail.

In 2020, Europorte recorded an improvement of €4 million in EBITDA compared to 2019. The €3 million decrease in revenue
was due firstly to the continuation of the SNCF Réseau strike until 13 January and then the Covid-19 crisis from mid-March.
Europorte was less affected by the public health crisis than Eurotunnel, but nevertheless put in place a furlough scheme for
some of its personnel following the shutdown of certain industrial sites, notably automotive and cement plants. In the second
half of 2020, the activity of the segment returned to levels above those expected before the Covid-19 pandemic, with a
strong demand for additional last-minute trains ordered to deliver products necessary for the manufacture of hand sanitiser,
as well as new national and international traffic routes.


-----

**d)** **ElecLink segment**

ElecLink’s activity is the construction and operation of a 1GW electricity interconnector between the United Kingdom and
France. Construction works began in the second half of 2016 and the interconnector is expected to be in commercial
operation mid-2022.

Costs directly attributable to the project are capitalised as assets under construction. Investment in the project during 2020
amounted to €74 million.

**Operating margin (EBITDA)**

EBITDA by business segment evolved as follows:

- Restated at the rate of exchange used for the 2020 income statement (£1=€1.126).

The significant reduction in Eurotunnel traffic from March 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic had a very significant
impact on the Group's consolidated operating margin (EBITDA) despite the measures put in place to limit its effects. At
€328 million in 2020 the Group’s consolidated EBITDA was down by €229 million compared to 2019.

**Trading profit and operating profit (EBIT)**

Depreciation charges increased by €4 million compared to 2019 to €186 million as a result of the capital investment projects
completed in 2019 and 2020.

The trading profit in 2020 decreased by €233 million (-62%) compared to 2019, to €142 million.

The operating profit for the 2020 financial year was down by €271 million (-67%) compared to 2019, to €134 million. In 2019,
net other operating income included a one-off amount of €38 million.

**Net financial charges**

At €240 million for 2020, net finance costs decreased by €15 million compared to 2019 at a constant exchange rate. This
decrease was mainly due to the impact of lower inflation rates in the United Kingdom and France on the cost of the indexed
tranche of the debt (€12 million) and the €4 million increase in the capitalisation of interest related to the financing of
ElecLink.

Other net financial charges of €15 million in 2020 (a net income of €3 million in 2019) consist mainly of costs related to
financial transactions of €24 million, partially compensated by interest earned on the G2 notes held by the Group (this income
is down by €5 million due to lower UK inflation rates).

**Net consolidated results**

The Group’s pre-tax result for continuing operations for the 2020 financial year was a loss of €121 million, a reduction of
€274 million compared to 2019 at a constant exchange rate (or a reduction of €236 million excluding the €38 million oneoff income recorded in 2019). The evolution of the pre-tax result from continuing operations by segment compared to 2019

After taking into account a net profit from discontinued activities of €8 million (see note C.2 to the consolidated financial
statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document), the net consolidated result for the Group’s continuing
activities in 2020 was a loss of €113 million compared to a profit of €156 million in 2019 at an equivalent exchange rate.

The table above summarises the Group’s
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31
December 2020 and 31 December 2019. The main
elements and changes between the two dates,
presented at the exchange rate for each period, are
as follows:

At 31 December 2020, fixed assets include
property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets amounting to €5,789 million for the
Eurotunnel segment, €820 million for the
ElecLink segment and €113 million for the
Europorte segment. Between 31 December
2019 and 31 December 2020, the investment of
€74 million in the ElecLink segment is mainly
due to capitalised investments and interest
relating to the project.

Other non-current assets at 31 December 2020 include the G2 inflation-linked notes held by the Group amounting to
€322 million and a deferred tax asset of €191 million.

At 31 December 2020, cash and cash equivalents amounted to €629 million after net capital expenditure of €117 million,
€263 million in debt service costs (net interest, repayments and fees) and the net proceeds of €125 million from the issue
of the 2025 Green Bonds and the refinancing of the 2023 Green Bonds in October 2020 as explained in note A.4 to the
consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2020 and in the section “Analysis of consolidated cash flows” below.

Equity decreased by €267 million as a result of the impact of the recycling to the income statement of the fair value of
the hedging contracts that were partially terminated in 2017 and the change in the fair value of the instruments totalling
€197 million, the impact of the net result for the period (loss of €113 million) and the recognition of an actuarial loss on
employee retirement benefits of €57 million. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the change in the
exchange rate on the translation adjustment of €89 million.

Financial liabilities have decreased by €8 million compared to 31 December 2019 as a result of the impact of the change
in the exchange rate on the sterling-denominated debt (€125 million) and of the effect of the €72 million of contractual
debt repayments. These decreases have been partially offset by the €12 million increase in lease liabilities under IFRS 16
and by the €27 million impact arising from of the evolution of inflation indexation and costs. The net impact on financial
liabilities of the operation on the Green Bonds was an increase of €150 million (see note A.4 to the consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2020).

The liability in respect of the fair value of the interest rate derivatives increased by €251 million due to the impact of a
decrease in long-term rates on the market value of the instruments.

Other liabilities include €237 million of trade and other payables, provisions, deferred income and other liabilities, as well
as retirement liabilities of €154 million.

- Maritime segment, see note C.2 to the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2020.

At €363 million in 2020, net cash generated from trading by continuing operations decreased by €226 million compared to
2019. This change can be explained by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Eurotunnel's activities:

a reduction of €221 million in the Eurotunnel and Getlink segments to €340 million (2019: €561 million);

a decrease of €5 million in Europorte’s cash flows to €24 million (2019: €29 million); and

ElecLink’s operating expenditure remained stable at €1 million.

The net receipt of €12 million from “Other operating cash and taxation” is mainly the receipt of £11 million in respect of the
settlement agreement between the UK Secretary of State for Transport and Eurotunnel concluded in 2019. 2020 saw net tax
receipts of €2 million compared to net receipts of €4 million in 2019. Payments related to other operating cash flows
decreased in 2020 compared to 2019.

At €117 million in 2020, net cash payments for investing activities are down by €129 million compared to 2019 as a result of
the Group’s decision to defer a significant portion of its capital expenditure planned for 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis. In
2020, these comprised:

€80 million relating to Eurotunnel and Getlink (2019: €104 million) including €29 million on preparations for Brexit and
other infrastructure projects, €37 million on rolling stock, and €11 million on computing and digital projects;

net payments of €35 million in relation to the ElecLink project (€141 million in 2019), including a receipt of €19 million
for the reimbursement of a cash collateral guarantee held by RTE in respect of French capacity markets; and

capital expenditure for the Europorte segment which remained stable at €2 million.

Net financing payments in 2020 amounted to €266 million compared to €442 million in 2019. During 2020, cash flow from
financing comprised:

capital transactions with an outflow of €3 million consisting of:

   - €2 million paid in respect of the liquidity contract in 2020 (€3 million received in 2019) and receipts of €1 million in
respect of the exercise of stock options (€3 million in 2019); in 2020 €2 million paid for treasury shares (€nil in 2019);
and

   - no dividend was paid in 2020 (2019: €193 million).

net debt service costs of €263 million:

   - €183 million of interest paid on the Term Loan and on other borrowings (€189 million in 2019);

   - €54 million paid in respect of the scheduled repayment of the Term Loan and other borrowings (€52 million in 2019);

   - €5 million million received in respect of the contractual repayment and €6 million received in respect of the interest
earned on the G2 notes held by the Group (€5 million and €7 million respectively in 2019);

   - €21 million paid in relation to leasing contracts (€21 million in 2019) presented in financing activities in accordance
with IFRS 16; and

   - €18 million paid in relation to financial operations completed in 2015 and 2018 (€7 million in 2019).
On 30 October 2020, the Group issued €700 million of senior secured “green” bonds (the “2025 Green Bonds”, see notes A.4
and G.1.1 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020). Part of the net proceeds of this
issue was used for the early redemption of the 2023 Green Bonds for a nominal amount of €550 million and for the payment
of transaction costs of €20 million. This transaction generated net cash inflows of €125 million.
The net cash outflow from discontinued operations of €6 million in 2020 is mainly comprised of €7 million paid by the Group
as part of the settlement agreement entered into in February 2020 putting an end to all claims incurred following the
liquidation of SCOP SeaFrance in July 2015 (see note C.2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2020).

**2.1.4** **KEY FINANCIAL INDICATORS**

**a)** **Free Cash Flow**

The Group’s Free Cash Flow represents the cash generated by current activities in the normal course of business. It can be
used to distribute dividends to shareholders and to make strategic investments in the Group’s development in order to add
value for all stakeholders. The Group defines its Free Cash flow as net cash flow from its current activities excluding
extraordinary or exceptional cash movements in respect of the equity-related cash flows, financial transactions such as the
raising of new debt to help finance new activities, debt refinancing, renegotiation or early repayment as well as investment
in new activities or the divestment of activities and related assets.

**2.1.5** **COVENANTS RELATING TO THE GROUP’S DEBT**

**a)** **Eurotunnel**

The debt service cover ratio and the synthetic service cover ratio on the Term Loan apply to the Eurotunnel Holding SAS
sub-group. These ratios are described in note G.1.2.b to the consolidated financial statements contained in section 2.2.1 of
this Universal Registration Document.

At 31 December 2020, Eurotunnel has respected its financial covenants under the Term Loan with a debt service cover ratio
and a synthetic service cover ratio of approximately 1.45.

Nevertheless, in the context of the health crisis and as a precautionary measure, on 17 October 2020, the Group agreed a
waiver with its creditors on its principal covenant, the senior debt coverage ratio (see note A.1 to the consolidated financial
statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document).

**b)** **Getlink**

The conditions attached to the 2025 Green Bonds issued by Getlink SE include financial ratios, or incurrence covenants, the
non-compliance with which may prevent the completion of certain transactions such as the payment of dividends or the
raising of additional financing, without however giving rise to an event of default. The Group did not comply with these
ratios as of 31 December 2020; however, the refinancing transaction concluded by Getlink in October 2020 increased the
Group’s flexibility to raise new financing (up to €400 million) and its ability to pay dividends (€150 million per year up to
€300 million) without having to comply with these ratios. For more information, see notes A.4 and G.1.1 to the consolidated
financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

###### Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements

**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

This is a translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements of the company issued in
French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users. This statutory auditors’ report includes
information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory
auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be
read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in
France.

To the Shareholders,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying
consolidated financial statements of Getlink SE for the year ended 31 December 2020.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

Audit Framework

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of
the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.

Independence

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code
(code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from
1 January 2020 to date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in
Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014.

**Justification of assessments - key audit matters**

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and
audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary
emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have
led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have
also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.

It is this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the
French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit
matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

**Recoverable value of ElecLink fixed assets**

**Risk identified** **Our answer**


The Group has undertaken a project to build and operate a
1 GW electrical interconnection between France and the
United Kingdom. Work began in 2016 and the interconnector
is now scheduled to be operational mid-2022. The costs
directly related to the project are recorded as assets under
construction.

As indicated in note A3 to the consolidated financial
statements, as of 31 December 2020, the book value of fixed
assets (ElecLink CGU) amounted to €799 million, including
€678 million of tangible assets relating to construction works
and €121 million of intangible assets relating to the
operating license and the exemption allowing ElecLink to use
the proceeds from the sale of interconnection capacities
(excluding goodwill and deferred tax liabilities for an
equivalent amount of €20 million).

The Group carried out an impairment test on ElecLink assets
at 31 December 2020, in accordance with the methods
described in note F.3.2 to the consolidated financial
statements.

The determination of the recoverable value of the ElecLink
assets represents a key audit matter, considering:

their materiality in the Group’s accounts;

uncertainties relating to the date of their entry into
service and to the granting of an extension of the
deadline for the exemption in its current terms;

management estimates, based on assumptions that are
uncertain by nature and require judgment.

**Recoverable value of fixed assets Concession**


We have assessed the methods used to implement the
impairment test carried out by management and, in
particular, we have:

corroborated the amount of the assets tested with the
accounting values of these assets at the end of 2020;

assessed the reasonableness of the income forecasts,
based on the current terms of the exemption, on the
basis of the reports of the independent experts;

assessed the probable nature of the date of entry into
service, based in particular on obtaining the agreement
of the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) in
December 2020, for pulling the cable through the
Tunnel, and of management estimates relating in
particular to the time needed to carry out the work once
the IGC agreement has been obtained;

assessed the likelihood of obtaining an extension of the
deadline for obtaining the exemption under its current
terms, taking into account the date of entry into service;

assessed, with the support of our experts, the
reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine
the discount rate;

verified the calculations related to the determination of
the value in use at the end of 2020 as well as the
sensitivity analyses carried out by the Group, taking into
account various scenarios;

assessed the appropriateness of the information
provided in notes A.3 and F.3.2 to the consolidated
financial statements at 31 December 2020.


**Risk identified** **Our answer**


The tangible Concession assets amount to €5,785 million as
of 31 December 2020, compared to a balance sheet total of
€8,058 million.

The Group carried out an impairment test on concession
assets at 31 December 2020, in accordance with the methods
described in note F.3.1 to the consolidated financial
statements.

The determination of the recoverable value of these assets
and of any impairment losses to be recognised is a key point
of the audit given the significant importance of these assets
in the Group's accounts and the high degree of estimation
and judgment required from management, in a context of
uncertainty reinforced by the implementation of Brexit and
the global crisis related to the Covid-19, on the assumptions
of future operating performance and traffic, exchange rates,
long-term growth rates and discount rates as well as the
sensitivity of the valuation to these assumptions.


We have assessed the methods used to implement the
impairment test carried out by management and, in
particular, we have:

assessed the reasonableness of the main assumptions
used, in particular the evolution of operating
performance and future traffic based on the Group's
latest business plan, long-term growth rates and the €/£
exchange rate;

assessed, with the support of our experts, the
reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine
the discount rate;

verified the calculations related to the determination of
the value in use at the end of 2020;

reviewed the sensitivity analyses carried out by the
Group, taking into account various scenarios;

assessed the appropriateness of the information
provided in note F.3.1 to the consolidated financial
statements at 31 December 2020.

**Accounting treatment of financial debt**

**Risk identified** **Our answer**


Financial debts, including notably the Term Loan and the
Senior Secured Notes issued in the form of Green Bonds and
the related interest rate derivatives, in the respective
amounts of €4,943 million and €1,306 million euros,
represent the most significant elements of the Group's
liabilities as of 31 December 2020.

As indicated in note G.1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Group has carried out various financial
transactions in recent years as part of the process of
reorganising its debt:

Division of tranches and renegotiation of contract terms,

Partial refinancing and partial termination of hedges,

Senior Secured Notes issue and refinancing (Green
Bonds),

Acquisition of the G2 inflation-linked bonds issued by
Channel Link Enterprises Finance Ltd (CLEF), recorded in
the amount of €322 million in the assets of the Group's
balance sheet at 31 December 2020.

In addition to the transactions initiated by the Group and as
mentioned in note G.1 to the financial statements, a
significant portion of the interest-rate derivative portfolio
was novated in 2020 by the bank acting as counterparty to
the transactions.

Considering the characteristics of the Group's financial debt
and the complexity of the related financial transactions, there
is a risk of error in the accounting treatment which we
considered as a key audit matter.

**Specific verifications**


We have:

verified the correct accounting of the Group's
contractual obligations notably in connection with the
refinancing of the Senior Secured Notes during the year;

verified the correct application of IFRS 9 concerning
effective interest rates;

checked the hedging documentation for derivative
instruments (particularly in the context of the novation
of a portion of the swaps in the portfolio at the request
of a bank counterparty) and the related effectiveness
calculation;

verified the fair value calculations of the financial debt
and derivative instruments;

assessed the appropriateness of the information
disclosed in note G to the Group's consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.


We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required
by laws and regulations of the Group’s information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code
(code de commerce), is included in the information relating to the group provided in the management report, being specified
that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-10 of this code, we have not verified the fair presentation and the
consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information provided in this declaration and this information
must be reported by an independent third party.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report

In accordance with Article 222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the company’s management informed us of its decision
to postpone the presentation of the consolidated financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic
format as defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 to years beginning on or after
1 January 2021. Therefore, this report does not include a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation
of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 4511-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code monétaire et financier).

Appointment of the Statutory Auditors

We were appointed as statutory auditors of Getlink SE (formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE) by the annual general meeting held
on 9 May 2007.

As at 31 December 2020, audit firms KPMG Audit and Mazars were in the 14th year of total uninterrupted engagement.

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control
and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting
procedures.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

**Statutory auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**

Objectives and audit approach

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include
assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises
professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered
to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal
control.

Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.

Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt
on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a
going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw
attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures
are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion
expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

Report to the Audit Committee

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit
programme implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control
regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key
audit matters, that we are required to describe in this audit report.


-----

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014,
confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by
Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code
de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

###### Notes to the financial statements

Getlink SE is the Group’s consolidating entity. Its registered office is at 3 rue La Boétie, 75008 Paris, France and its shares are
listed on Euronext Paris. The term “Getlink SE” refers to the holding company which is governed by French law. The term
“Group” refers to Getlink SE and all its subsidiaries.

The main activities of the Group are the design, financing, construction and operation by the “Eurotunnel” segment of the
Fixed Link’s infrastructure and transport system in accordance with the terms of the Concession (which will expire in 2086),
the rail freight activity of the Europorte segment as well as the construction and operation (expected mid-2022) of the 1GW
electricity interconnector in the Tunnel by ElecLink. The maritime activity was discontinued in 2015 (see note C.2 below).

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 24 February 2021 and will be submitted
for approval to the shareholders’ General Meeting.

###### A. Important events

 A.1 Covid-19 pandemic

Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the French and British governments have adopted,
since March 2020 and on several occasions throughout the year, strict provisions for the confinement of the populations
and the restriction of movement of people within and between the two countries. These measures remain in force at the
closing date.

The public health crisis and the successive measures taken by the governments have had a severe impact on traffic and on
the Group’s internal organisation, and more particularly on Eurotunnel’s activities, which have suffered from mid-March to
the end of the year from a very sharp decline in traffic, particularly for Passenger Shuttles and in the number of Eurostar
passengers. The Truck Shuttle business also suffered a significant decline in traffic, although to a lesser extent than other
sectors, due initially to the need to maintain supply flows of essential goods between France and the United Kingdom, and
then over the last quarter of the year due to the effect of stockpiling in the United Kingdom ahead of the end of the Brexit
Transition Period on 31 December 2020.

Europorte’s business was also impacted during the first half of the year, particularly traffic in the automotive sector.

Faced with this situation, the Group implemented a series of measures to allow the movement of goods, while ensuring the
health safety of its customers and staff.

It has also taken decisions to preserve its cash flow by implementing activité partielle in France and a furlough scheme in
the United Kingdom for part of its workforce. The Group has also launched a savings plan aimed at limiting its expenditure
to what is strictly necessary, and at deferring a significant portion of its capital expenditure planned for 2020, while ensuring
that it maintains the expenditure required for safety, continuity of operations and preparation of Brexit. All of these measures
remain in place at the closing date.

Among other measures to preserve its cash position, the Group also announced on 3 April 2020 the cancellation of the
payment of its 2019 dividend. The refinancing of Getlink's Senior Secured Notes concluded in October 2020 (see note A.4
below) also enabled the Group to strengthen its cash position.

The impact of the public health crisis and government measures implemented by the Group on the Group’s results and
financial position in 2020 is detailed in note D.9 below.

Despite this unfavourable environment, the various measures taken by the Group throughout 2020 enabled it to comply at
31 December 2020 with the covenants relating to Eurotunnel's Term Loan and to strengthen its liquidity position. At
31 December 2020, the Group's cash and cash equivalents amounted to €629 million, up €104 million compared to the end
of 2019.

Nevertheless, in the context of the public health crisis and as a precautionary measure, on 17 October 2020, the Group
entered into agreement with its creditors for a waiver on its main covenant, the “senior debt coverage ratio”, failure to comply
with which would constitute an event of default under the Term Loan. This waiver will apply for the three test dates between
December 2020 and December 2021 inclusive, unless the Group decides that such a waiver is not required no later than two
months prior to one of the dates in question. The waiver is subject to certain conditions, including the holding of a minimum
cash balance of approximately €200 million at the Eurotunnel sub-group level at the relevant dates. At 31 December 2020,
the cash held by the Eurotunnel sub-group totalled €330 million.

The consequences for the Group of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 will depend on the evolution of the pandemic over the
coming months and the decisions and actions of the French, European and British authorities, as well as their impact on the
economy in general and on cross-Channel transport in particular.

As part of the preparation of its budget estimates for 2021 and subsequent years, the Group has used the information
available to date and its best assessment of how the situation, particularly in terms of health, could evolve in the short and
medium term. These estimates are obviously subject to uncertainty in the context of high pandemic volatility. On the basis
of these forecasts, the Group will have a sufficient level of liquidity to cover the servicing of its debt in 2021 and 2022 as well
as the financing of its activities.


-----

As indicated in note G.1.1 below, the conditions attached to the 2025 Green Bonds issued by Getlink SE include financial
ratios (“incurrence covenants”), the non-compliance with which may prevent the completion of certain transactions such as
the payment of dividends or the raising of additional financing, without however giving rise to an event of default. The Group
did not comply with these ratios at 31 December 2020. However, following the refinancing transaction entered into by Getlink
in October 2020 (see notes A.4 and G.1.1 below), the conditions associated with the new notes issued increase the Group's
flexibility to raise new financing (up to €400 million) and its ability to pay dividends (€150 million per year up to a limit of
€300 million) without having to comply with these ratios.

The Group has taken this context into account in determining the main estimates and assumptions made in preparing its
annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, as set out in note B.3.3 below. It also
confirms that the indications of impairment identified on the assets of the Concession and ElecLink led it to carry out
impairment tests on its assets at 31 December 2020, which did not result in the recognition of any exceptional impairment
at that date (see note F below). In addition, the Group's exposure to credit risk on its operating activities did not lead it to
significantly reconsider the expected credit losses on its customers at 31 December 2020.

###### A.2 Brexit: the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union

Following the decision of the referendum of 23 June 2016 and the triggering of Article 50 by the British government at the
end of March 2017, the official exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union took place on 31 January 2020 with a
Transition Period that ended on 31 December 2020. On 24 December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union
concluded an agreement on their future trade relations. The UK Government indicated that the application of the new border
control arrangements would be phased in during the first half of 2021.

During the year, the Group finalised the implementation of its action and investment plan launched in mid-2018 and
designed to maintain traffic fluidity in the post-Brexit period. These plans and the new procedures for managing vehicle and
goods inspections have been in operation since 1 January 2021.

The Group has taken this context into account in determining the main estimates and assumptions made in preparing its
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, as described in note B.3.3 below.

###### A.3 ElecLink project

Following the completion of construction work on the converter stations, manufacturing and cable preparation in 2019, the
project’s progress in 2020 was impacted by the public health crisis. Investment in the project during 2020 amounted to €74
million, bringing the total assets for the ElecLink segment to €799 million as at 31 December 2020, including €679 million in
fixed assets and €121 million in intangible assets (excluding goodwill and deferred tax liabilities of the same amount (€20
million)).

During the year, the Group continued discussions with the IGC, the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, and their experts.
Following an initial consent granted on 7 October to carry out and test the connection of the converter stations to the
national electricity networks, the IGC gave its approval on 10 December for the installation of the cable in the Tunnel.

The cable installation work began in January and is expected to last until the summer of 2021. Once the cable has been
installed, a phase of in-depth tests and trials will be necessary before commercial operation can begin, which is scheduled
for mid-2022.

In addition, the exemption under article 17 of the European Union Electricity Regulation granted to ElecLink by national
regulators and the European Commission in 2014 was conditional on the interconnector being operational before 31 July
2020. During 2020, the national regulators and the European Commission granted a first extension of five months, until 31
December 2020, to allow ElecLink to obtain the agreement of the IGC and thus determine its final commissioning date. The
Group having obtained the IGC agreement on 10 December 2020, the national regulators and the European Commission
granted a further six-month extension until 30 June 2021 to allow stakeholders to finalise an agreement on the final inservice date. ElecLink will thus submit in the first half of 2021 a request for a final extension of the deadline for bringing the
interconnector into service. The Group remains confident of a favourable outcome to this request.

The Group has taken this context, and in particular the cable installation authorisation, into account in determining the main
estimates and assumptions made as part of the test for the valuation of ElecLink's assets at 31 December 2020, as set out in
note F.3.2 below.

###### A.4 Issue of Senior Secured Notes, the “2025 Green Bonds”

On 30 October 2020, Getlink SE completed the issue of €700 million Senior Secured Notes (the “2025 Green Bonds”). The
bonds were issued at par, bear interest at an annual rate of 3.50% and will mature in October 2025.

The net proceeds of this issue were used in particular to redeem the bonds issued in 2018 and the additional cash raised will
be used to finance the ElecLink project and other “green” investments.

Information on the 2025 Green Bonds and the conditions attached thereto is detailed in note G.1.1 below.


-----

###### B. Principles of preparation, main accounting policies and methods

The consolidated accounts consist of the consolidation of the accounts of Getlink SE and its subsidiaries as set out in the
table in note C.1 below. The accounting periods of the Group companies run from 1 January to 31 December.

###### B.1 Statement of compliance and Group accounting standards

Pursuant to EC Regulation 297/2008 of 11 March 2008 on International Accounting Standards, the Group's consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 are prepared in accordance with international accounting
standards as published by IASB and approved by the European Union as at 31 December 2020. These international standards
include International Accounting Standards (IAS), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations (SIC
and IFRIC).

The Group has control over the nature and price of the services it provides, and therefore does not meet the criteria set out
in IFRIC 12 relating to concession contracts.

The Group has not anticipated the application of any standards or interpretations, the implementation of which is not
mandatory in 2020.

###### B.2 Changes in accounting standards as at 31 December 2020

The standards and interpretations used and described in the annual financial statements as at 31 December 2019 have been
supplemented by the standards, amendments and interpretations whose application is mandatory for financial years
beginning on or after 1 January 2020.

**B.2.1** **Texts adopted by the European Union whose application is compulsory**

The texts adopted by the European Union, the application of which is compulsory for financial years beginning on or after
1 January 2020, are as follows:

amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – definition of “material”;

amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – interest rate benchmark reform – phase 1;

amendments to IFRS 3 – definition of a business; and

temporary amendment to IFRS 16 – Covid-19-related rent concessions.

The application of these texts as well as the latest decisions of the IFRIC has not had a significant impact on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements.

**B.2.2** **Other texts and amendments published by the IASB but not approved by the European Union**

The following texts concerning accounting rules and methods specifically applied by the Group have not yet been approved
by the European Union:

amendments to IAS 1 – classification of liabilities as current or non-current;

amendments to IFRS 3 – business combinations – references to the conceptual framework;

amendments to IAS 16 – proceeds before intended use of property, plant and equipment; and

amendments to IAS 37 – cost of fulfilling a contract.
The potential impact of these texts will be assessed by the Group in subsequent years.

###### B.3 Basis of preparation

The Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.

**B.3.1** **Conversion of foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the reporting currency of each individual company at the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than those
mentioned in note B.3.2 below are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period. The resulting exchange
differences are dealt with in the income statement.

**B.3.2** **Exchange rates for consolidated entities**

Getlink SE’s company accounts and consolidated accounts are prepared in euros.

With the exception of ElecLink Limited which prepares its accounts in euros, the accounts of the Group’s British subsidiaries,
and notably CTG and its subsidiaries, are prepared in sterling and are converted into euros as follows:

Retained reserves brought forward and Concession property, plant and equipment and related depreciation, at historical
rates.

All other assets and liabilities at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period.

Income statement items, with the exception of the Concessionaires’ depreciation, at the average rate for the year.

Exchange differences arising from the application of the above are included in the cumulative translation reserve in the
statement of financial position.


-----

The closing and average €/£ exchange rates for 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

€/£ **2020** **2019**

Closing rate 1.112 1.175

Average rate 1.126 1.140

**B.3.3** **Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. The Board of
Directors periodically reviews its valuations and estimates based on its experience and various other factors considered
relevant for the determination of reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’ carrying value. In
addition, the estimates underlying the preparation of these annual financial statements as at 31 December 2020 have been
established in the context of the uncertainties concerning the Covid-19 pandemic and the final terms and conditions for the
implementation of Brexit. Depending on the evolution of these assumptions, actual results may differ from current estimates.

The use of estimations concerns mainly the valuation of intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment (see note F)
in particular for the ElecLink project, the evaluation of the Group’s deferred tax situation (note I), the valuation of the Group’s
retirement liabilities (see note E.4) and certain elements of the valuation of financial assets and liabilities (note G.9) as well
as the application of IFRS 16 “Leases” in particular for the definition of the lease and the estimation of the remaining term
of each lease (note G.4).

###### C. Scope of consolidation


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Global integration**

The accounts of entities under the Group’s direct or indirect control are included in the consolidated financial statements
using the full consolidation method. Control of an entity is deemed to exist when the Group:

holds power over the entity,

is exposed to, or entitled to, variable returns due to its involvement with the entity, and

has the ability to exercise its power over the relevant activities of the entity in order to affect the amount of returns it
obtains.

All significant transactions between the consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated, as are the Group’s internal results (capital
gains, profits on inventories, dividends).

The results of acquired subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is exercised. Companies acquired or
incorporated during the period are consolidated from the date of acquisition or incorporation.

- Europorte Proximité SAS was merged into Socorail with effect from 28 April 2020.
** EurotunnelPlus GmbH is in the process of being wound up.
*** On 26 May 2020, the registered corporate name of JP Serwices SARL was changed to Getlink Regions SAS.
**** The registered corporate name of Eurotunnel Project SAS was changed to JV-G-ING SAS on 31 March 2020, then to Kinesis SAS on 30 September 2020.

At 31 December 2019 and at 31 December 2020, all the Group’s companies were fully consolidated (FC) except for the
following companies which are accounted for under the equity method (EM):

On 31 March 2020, Getlink SE transferred 50% of its shares in Kinesis SAS (formerly Eurotunnel Project SAS) at par value.
Since that date, Kinesis SAS has been consolidated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements using the equity
method at 50%.

RDGL Rail SAS (commercial name “Régionéo”) was registered on 27 July 2020 as a 45%/55% joint venture between the
Getlink SE and RATP Dev to respond to calls for tenders for regional passenger rail transport as part of the opening up
to competition of the rail market in France. RDGL Rail SAS is consolidated by the Group using the equity method at 45%.

The two companies consolidated using the equity method will have an activity whose nature is in line with the Group's
business. As such, the share of net income of these companies is included in the sub-total of the consolidated income
statement entitled “Share of result of equity-accounted companies”.


-----

###### C.2 Changes in the scope of consolidation 


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Business combinations**

Business combinations are recorded in accordance with the acquisition accounting method as set out in the revised IFRS 3.
Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value.

When a business is acquired in stages, the Group's previously held interest in the business acquired is revalued to fair
value through profit or loss at the time of full acquisition. For the determination of goodwill at the date of control, the
fair value of the consideration transferred (for example the price paid) is increased by the fair value of the interest
previously held by the Group.

Costs directly attributable to acquisition transactions are recognised in the operating result for the year.

**Sale of businesses**

The result of the entities sold in the period, together with the gain or loss on the disposal of these activities and the costs
directly attributable to the transaction, are presented, net of tax, on a separate line item in the income statement entitled
“Net result from discontinued activities”. The same treatment is applied to the income statement for the previous financial
year. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognised in respect of the investment held prior to the
sale is recycled to the income statement.

**Assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations**

IFRS 5 “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” sets out the accounting treatment applicable to
assets held for sale and the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.

Assets held for sale

Non-current assets held for sale are presented on a separate line of the statement of financial position when (i) the Group
has made the decision to sell the asset(s) concerned and (ii) the sale is considered to be highly probable. These assets are
measured at the lower of their net carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell.

Property, plant and equipment classified as “Assets held for sale” are no longer subject to impairment and depreciation
is stopped at the date of application of IFRS 5.

Discontinued operations

A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that the Group has decided to dispose of, either by terminating or
selling the activity and which represents a separate sector of activity and is part of a single co-ordinated disposal plan.

When these criteria are met, the results of discontinued operations are presented on a separate line in the consolidated
income statement for each period. The Group assesses whether a discontinued operation represents a separate sector of
activity mainly on the basis of its relative contribution to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued operations (including non-current assets, current assets and the related liabilities classified as held for sale)
are measured as a whole at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

Costs specifically incurred in the context of the cessation of the activity are presented in the income statement within the
“Net result from discontinued operations”.


**Assets held for sale and discontinued operations**

The net result per discontinued activity is as below:

€'000 **2020** **2019**

Maritime segment 8,681 603

**Net result from discontinued activities** **8,681** **603**

**Earnings per share from discontinued activities (€):**

Basic 0.02 0.00

Diluted 0.02 0.00

Since its maritime activity ceased in the second half of 2015, the Group has applied IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale
and Discontinued Operations” to its maritime segment. In 2017, the Group sold its three ferries.


-----

Litigation following the discontinuation of the maritime activity

During the year, the main disputes and claims relating to the termination of the Group's maritime activities in 2015 were
settled.

A settlement agreement was reached in February 2020 putting an end to all the claims made by the court-appointed agent
of SCOP SeaFrance, by the AGS and by the various Group companies following the liquidation of SCOP SeaFrance in July
2015. As part of this agreement, the Group paid a definitive lump-sum settlement of €7 million in 2020.

In a ruling handed down on 30 April 2020, the Paris Maritime Arbitration Chamber again rejected all of DFDS’s claims
challenging the price paid for the acquisition of the Rodin and Berlioz vessels from the Group in 2017. This decision puts an
end to DFDS’s appeal.

In this context, the Group reversed the provision recorded in its consolidated financial statements relating to the risks
associated with the discontinuation of its maritime activities (see note D.8 below).

** For information on discontinued operations, see note C.2 above.

**D.1.2** **Geographical information**

Eurotunnel’s activities are mainly those of the transport of freight, vehicles and passengers between France and the United
Kingdom.

The Europorte segment’s revenues are generated mainly in France.

###### D.2 Revenue


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

Revenue corresponds to sales of services as part of the ordinary activities of the Group's various segments.

**Eurotunnel**

Sales are recognised in revenue when the service is delivered.

For the Truck Shuttle activity, revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made.

For the Passenger Shuttle activity:

   - when the reservation is made, the tickets are recorded in “deferred income”,

   - then the revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made.

For the Railway Network passenger and rail freight tolls, revenue is recognised when the crossing has been made. For
the Railway Network’s annual fixed charges and contributions to its operating and investment costs, revenue is
recognised as a function of the Fixed Link’s availability.


-----

**Europorte**

For the rail transport activity, revenue corresponds to sales of transport services and sales are recognised in revenue when
the service is actually performed.

For the maintenance and management of railway infrastructure, sales are recognised in revenue when the services are
actually performed.


Revenue is analysed as follows:

€'000 **2020** **2019**

the British government.

###### D.6 Trade and other receivables


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

Trade and other receivables are included in the category “Financial assets measured at amortised cost”.

For trade receivables, receivables with a proven risk and considered doubtful are subject to an impairment loss determined
on the basis of the estimated recoverable amount.

In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9, receivables that do not present a proven risk are subject to an impairment
calculation for expected impairment losses. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has adopted the
simplified approach for trade receivables. Impairment losses are estimated using an impairment matrix based on historical
default rates of receivables over their lifetime.

###### D.9 Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic

As indicated in note A.1 above, the public health crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the
French and British governments concerning the confinement of the population and the movement of people within and
between the two countries had a significant impact on the Group’s business and results in 2020, and in particular on those
of Eurotunnel. In accordance with the recommendations of regulators, the Group has not recognised any impact of the
Covid-19 pandemic in the non-current items of its income statement.

**Eurotunnel**

Traffic in Eurotunnel’s various activities fell sharply between March and June as part of the containment measures and travel
restrictions introduced by governments in response to the first wave of the health crisis. Truck Shuttle traffic gradually
resumed in the second half of the year and benefited in the last quarter of 2020 from the effect of stockpiling in anticipation
of the end of the Brexit Transition Period on 31 December 2020.

Passenger Shuttle traffic experienced a brief recovery during the summer with the temporary lifting of quarantine measures,
but was again impacted by new travel restrictions imposed from mid-August and by the new confinement measures
introduced during the last quarter and still in force at the end of the year.

Eurostar traffic has remained at a very low level for the whole period since mid-March, penalised by travel restrictions and
social distancing measures limiting the level of service available.

Eurotunnel’s revenues were down by €261 million in 2020 compared to 2019 at a constant exchange rate. This decrease
mainly concerned the two periods of confinement and travel restrictions between March and June and between September
and December and reflects the fall in Shuttle Service and Eurostar passenger traffic during these periods:

Eurotunnel’s operating and staff costs reduced by €27 million in 2020, mainly due to savings generated by the actions
implemented by the Group in its response to the health crisis. Faced with the drop in traffic between March and June, and
again from October onwards, the Group revised its Shuttle capacity and operating plans downwards and introduced partial
activity schemes covering some of its staff in France and in the United Kingdom in accordance with the measures introduced
by the French and British governments. €3 million in additional costs were incurred in 2020 in relation to equipment and
other measures taken to ensure the protection of the Group’s customers and staff during the health crisis.

**Europorte**

The impact of the health crisis on Europorte’s EBITDA in 2020 was €7 million, due to the drop in traffic in certain sectors,
notably the automotive and cement industries during the first half of the year.

**Group**

In 2020, the Group’s EBITDA decreased by €229 million compared to 2019 at a constant exchange rate. This decrease mainly
concerns the activity of the Eurotunnel segment and is concentrated in the two periods of confinement and travel restrictions
between March and June, and then from September onwards:

target, the Group estimates the impact of the health crisis on its consolidated EBITDA for the 2020 financial year at
approximately €250 million.

###### E.4 Retirement benefits


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

The Group provides for its legal and contractual obligations for retirement indemnities of employees under French
contracts, and for the defined benefit retirement schemes of employees under UK contracts operated by CTG and ESL.
The liability for defined benefits, recorded in the statement of financial position, is the present value of the obligation
under defined benefit plans at the end of the financial year less the fair value of plan assets. These liabilities are valued
using the actuarial method of projected unit of credit on the basis of actuarial valuations made at the end of each financial
year. The current service cost of the period and the interest on the obligation are accounted for in the “staff benefit
expense” line of the consolidated income statement. Valuation of the liability for defined benefit plans in respect of (i)
actuarial gains and losses, (ii) the actual return on plan assets and (iii) changes in the effect of the asset ceiling benefits
are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.


The Group has provided for the following retirement liabilities:

**Total** **153,514** **98,331**

**E.4.1** **UK employee defined benefit obligations**

Getlink SE operates two pension schemes in the UK: The Channel Tunnel Group Pension Fund and The Channel Tunnel Group
Senior Executives Pension Fund providing defined benefits for ESL staff based on final pensionable pay. The characteristics
of these schemes are similar and the assets of each are held in separate trustee-administered funds.

The valuation at the end of the financial year has been prepared by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the
requirements of the amended IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities and assets of the schemes as at the end of the reporting
period.

The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant
change, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and
thus inherently uncertain, were:

The main assumptions that have been used in the actuarial calculations are as follows:

**2020** **2019**

Discount rate 1.3% 2.0%

Inflation rate 3.0% 3.1%

Future pension increases 2.9% 3.0%

**Sensitivity to changes in the main assumptions**

Reasonably possible changes to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions at the end of the reporting period, all things being
equal, would have affected the defined benefit liability by the amounts shown below.

€'000
**At 31 December 2020** **Increase** **Decrease**

Discount rate: +/-1% (82,756) 108,784

Inflation: +/-1% 72,856 (66,071)

Mortality: +/-1 an 21,690 (21,134)

**Expected cash outflows and risks associated with pension liabilities**

The investment strategy for managing the assets of the pension schemes is defined by the trustees of the pension funds.
The maturities of the contributions and the level of funding of schemes are negotiated between the Group and the trustees
on the basis of actuarial valuations carried out every three years. Contributions are intended both to recover the deficit
related to rights acquired in the past and to cover the service costs in future years.

The Group estimates that contributions to be paid into the defined benefit schemes in the 2021 financial year will be
€3.3 million, of which €1.5 million will be in respect of current service costs for the period and €1.8 million will be in respect
of the recovery of the deficit in the Channel Tunnel Group Pension Fund. The weighted average duration of the ESL plan is
21 years.

###### E.5 Share-based payments


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Share-based payments**

Share options are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. The options are valued at their fair value at the date on which
they are granted (see next paragraph) and any variations in value occurring after the grant date are not taken into account.
The value is charged to employee benefits expense on a straight line basis between the date of the grant and the maturity
date (the vesting period), with an equal and opposite entry directly to equity.

**Measurement of fair value**

The fair value of stock option plans is measured by applying the binomial Black & Scholes model and the Monte Carlo
approach. The basis of calculation includes the share price on the grant date, the exercise price of the options, expected
volatility of the underlying shares, expected period before exercise, expected dividends and share yield, and the expected
turnover of beneficiaries. Performance conditions which are not related to the market are not included in the fair value
measurement.


**E.5.1** **Share options**

**Share option plan (treated as an equity instrument)**

On 26 May 2010, the General Meeting of shareholders authorised the Board to grant, in one or several allocations, options
over shares in the company to executives and senior staff of Getlink SE and its subsidiaries, during a period the duration of
which is fixed at 38 months from 26 May 2010. The total number of options may not give the right to more than 3,900,000
shares of a nominal value of €0.40 each. The Board allocated 3,900,000 shares held under the share buyback programme to
these options. Under this scheme, the Board have approved three grants of share options: on 16 July 2010, 21 July 2011 and
20 July 2012.

The 2010 plan expired in July 2020.

On 29 April 2014, 29 April 2015, 18 April 2018 and 18 April 2019, the General Meetings of shareholders authorised the Board
of Directors to grant to executives and senior staff of Getlink SE and its subsidiaries preference shares with a nominal value
of €0.01 each with no voting rights which are convertible into Getlink SE ordinary shares subject to performance conditions
at the end of a three-year period. The total number of preference shares may not give the right to more than 5,500,000
ordinary shares of a nominal value of €0.40 each. Under this scheme, the Board approved on 29 April 2014, 29 April 2015,
18 April 2018 and 18 April 2019 respectively the grant of a maximum total number of 5,500,000 ordinary shares.

###### F. Intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment

 F.1 Goodwill and intangible assets


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the acquired portion of identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities. It is measured in the functional currency of the acquired entity and is recognised in
the statement of financial position.

When the share of the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of acquisition,
a negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.

The fair value of intangible assets acquired following a business combination is measured using the present value of
forecast future cash flows after taxation generated by the assets concerned. The method of depreciation of these
intangible assets is determined according to the nature of the assets concerned.

**Leasing contracts**

The Group has applied IFRS 16 on leasing contracts since 31 December 2018 using the modified retrospective transition
method from 1 January 2018. On the balance sheet, the Group recognises leases as assets in the form of a right of use
against a lease liability for all contracts, regardless of their nature (operating or finance lease). In the income statement,
the Group recognises depreciation and interest expense and in the cash flow statement, it presents lease payments as
part of cash flows from financing activities. The Group uses a single discount rate for all contracts on the basis that, as
supported by a sensitivity analysis, changes in the rate have very little impact on the amount of the adjustments, as the
remaining term of the contracts is relatively short. Contracts with a remaining term of less than 12 months are excluded
and the right of use is recorded for an amount equivalent to the lease liability.


**Goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisition of ElecLink**

The goodwill that was accounted for on the acquisition of ElecLink, amounting to €119,955,000 at 31 December 2016, was
fully allocated in 2017 to an intangible asset representing the estimate of fair value as at the date of acquisition of ElecLink
in 2016 of the licence and exemption granted to ElecLink by the national regulators in 2013 and 2014. The intangible asset
will be depreciated over the term of the licence and the exemption, over a period of 25 years from the date of start of
operation of ElecLink’s interconnector.

Residual goodwill of €20,392,000 was recognised as of 31 December 2017 resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax
liability on the intangible asset in accordance with IAS 12.


-----

**Right of use of leasing contracts**

The Group opted for early adoption of IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2018. The application of this standard results in the recognition
as assets in the form of a right-of-use of the lease contracts in consideration for a leasing liability. Assets under lease are
locomotives and other rolling stock belonging to the Europorte segment (totalling a net amount of €34,986,000 as at 31
December 2020) and premises occupied by Europorte, Getlink and ElecLink as well as service vehicles.

###### F.2 Tangible property, plant and equipment


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a systematic basis in order to write down the costs of assets over their
expected useful lives as follows:


**Fixed Link** **Europorte**

Tunnels Concession 
Land, construction, fixtures and fittings Length of contract / 20 years


Terminals and related land:


Freehold land not depreciated

Concession land Concession 
Landscaping 5 to 57 years

Terminals 5 years to life of Concession 

Fixed equipment and machinery:


Fixed equipment 5 years to life of Concession  
Fixtures and fittings 5 to 57 years

Buildings 5 to 30 years

Machinery and other equipment 5 to 30 years

Industrial equipment 3 to 10 years

Rolling stock: 5 to 35 years

Vehicles 5 to 60 years

Parts 5 to 40 years

Office equipment: 3 to 10 years

Office equipment 3 to 10 years

IT equipment 3 to 10 years

Software 3 to 20 years



- The Concession expires in 2086.


-----

The expected useful lives of the assets are kept under review and revised when necessary, according to experience.

Concession property, plant and equipment whose useful life is greater than the duration of the Concession, is
depreciated over the life of the Concession on a straight line basis.

Depreciation on assets whose useful life is less than the duration of the Concession (“renewable assets”) is calculated
on a straight line basis. As all property, plant and equipment will be written down to £nil at the end of the Concession
in 2086, depreciation of the final renewal cost of renewable assets will be based on the residual duration of the
Concession.

Costs directly attributable to the ElecLink project are capitalised and presented as “assets in course of construction” in
the statement of financial position. They will be amortised from the date they are put into operation.

Subsidies on capital expenditure received during the year have been allocated to the asset to which they relate.

**Measurement of fair value**

The fair value of tangible property, plant and equipment acquired following a business combination is measured by
taking the higher of the market value or the value in use.


**F.2.1** **Concession property, plant and equipment**

In France, all immovable property, plant and equipment within the Concession area is the property of the French state and
will revert to it on the expiry of the Concession period (2086). In the United Kingdom, the Government has required CTG to
transfer to it the title to freehold land and property acquired for the purpose of construction and operation of the project
and in exchange has granted leases for the duration of the Concession. On the expiry of the Concession, the interest of the
Concessionaires in all movable property and intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of the Concession will
become, without payment, the joint property of the two States.

###### F.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

In accordance with IAS 36, the carrying amounts of assets and groups of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting
period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

In the Group each activity segment represents a cash-generating unit (CGU). In certain circumstances, the CGU may be
made up of a single or several operating legal entities.

If any indication of impairment exists, an impairment test is carried out on assets with finite useful lives: the net book
value of the asset is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their market
value and their value in use. The market value is determined by reference to studies carried out by independent experts.

The value in use of CGUs is calculated by discounting operating cash flows after taxation and capital expenditure incurred
to replace assets as forecast in each of the CGU’s business plan as validated by the Group’s management as part of its
operational management. The period covered by the business plan is five years. For Concession assets, cash flows are
extrapolated on the basis of an assumption of growth over the residual duration of the Concession. For non-Concession
assets, the extrapolation is complemented by a terminal value which is calculated on the basis of infinite free cash flows
that continue to grow at a moderate rate limited to that of inflation. The discount rate retained is the WACC calculated


-----

per CGU at each year end. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

Impairment losses on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) may be reversed
subsequently if the recoverable amount becomes higher than the carrying amount, up to the amount of the impairment
loss initially recognised less any additional depreciation or amortisation that would have been recognised had no
impairment loss been recognised.


The significant decline in Eurotunnel revenues in 2020 as a result of the public health crisis (see note D.9 above), as well as
the postponement of the entry into service of the ElecLink project, are indications of impairment under IAS 36. Consequently,
the Group carried out a value-in-use test of the assets of these segments at 31 December 2020 in order to ensure that the
recoverable value of the assets remained higher than their net accounting value.

**F.3.1** **Concession property, plant and equipment**

The valuation test at 31 December 2020 was performed by applying a WACC of 5.79% (5.60% at 31 December 2019) and
based on the Group’s best estimates at that date of the likely evolution of the health crisis, government measures and the
economic situation in Europe and the United Kingdom over the short and medium term. In particular, the test incorporates
the assumption of a gradual recovery in traffic and revenues for the Shuttles and the Rail Network over the second half of
2021 and over the year 2022 to return to pre-crisis levels in 2022 for the Shuttles and in 2023 for the Rail Network, followed
by revenue growth of approximately 2% per year beyond that date. This test confirms that the recoverable amount of
Eurotunnel’s Concession assets is higher than their carrying amount at 31 December 2020.

The Group has also carried out sensitivity analyses on changes in its crisis exit projections and other key assumptions
(discount rate, long-term revenue growth rate, sterling/euro exchange rate). These analyses did not reveal any probable
scenario leading to an impairment of the Concession assets.

**F.3.2** **ElecLink property, plant and equipment**

ElecLink’s assets are composed of tangible assets in respect of construction works (see note F.2.2 above) and an intangible
asset consisting of the operating license and the exemption (see note F.1 above). The interconnector is now expected to
start operating mid-2022.

At 31 December 2020, the Group performed a test of value in use of the ElecLink CGU. The valuation test carried out by
applying a WACC of 6.56% (7.78% at 31 December 2019) incorporates the assumptions that the interconnector will be
operational mid-2022 and that the contractual conditions of the exemption will be maintained at that date (base case).

This test confirms that the value in use of all the assets of the ElecLink CGU is higher than its carrying amount at 31 December
2020.

In the context of the interconnector construction project detailed in note A.3 above, sensitivity analyses were performed as
of 31 December 2020 to measure the impact of downward and upward changes in the assumptions used on value in use, in
particular the commissioning date and the level of revenues generated by the interconnector. The results of these sensitivity
analyses are presented in the table below.


**WACC**
**+0.50%**


**Accounting value tested: €799m**

6 month delay €988m €915m

6 month delay, -5% intrinsic revenues and -5% capacity market €927m €857m

However, in view of the ongoing construction of the ElecLink project and the current context, in particular in relation to
Brexit, the assumptions on which these estimates are based are by their nature still uncertain and the actual results could be
different from these estimates.

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets

Classification and evaluation

In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets are classified as financial assets at amortised cost, fair value through equity or
at fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the instrument (debt or equity), characteristics of their
contractual flows and how the entity manages its financial instruments (business model).

The business model of the entity represents the way in which financial assets are managed to generate cash flow. The
exercise of judgment is necessary to appreciate the business model.

A financial asset is said to be “basic” if the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash
flows corresponding solely to repayments of principal and interest calculated on the capital remaining due. The
determination of the basic character is to be carried out for each financial asset, debt instrument, when it is initially
recognised.

i. Debt instruments measured at amortised cost

A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost if it satisfies both of the following conditions:

      - the asset is held as part of a business model for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows, and

      - the contractual terms of the financial asset define the latter as basic (SPPI) within the meaning of the
standard.

Debt instruments at amortised cost are initially measured at fair value and then at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method. For short-term receivables with no stated interest rate, the fair value is treated as
the amount of the invoice unless the interest rate has a significant impact.

Income accrued or acquired on debt instruments is recorded under “Finance income” using the effective interest
rate method.

These instruments are subject to the IFRS 9 requirements for impairment.

Trade receivables fall into this category. This category also includes the inflation-linked G2 notes held by the
Group in other non-current financial assets.

ii. Debt instruments measured at fair value through equity

A debt instrument is measured at fair value through equity only if it meets both of the following conditions:

      - the asset is held as part of a business model whose objective is both the collection of contractual cash
flows and the sale of financial assets, and

      - the contractual terms of the financial asset define the latter as basic (SPPI) within the meaning of the
standard.

Debt instruments at fair value through equity are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. At the
balance sheet date, they are measured at their fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in gains and
losses recognised directly in equity (recyclable in profit or loss). The assets in foreign currencies being monetary,
fair value for the currency component affects the result.

Income accrued or acquired on debt instruments is recorded under “Finance income” using the effective interest
rate method.

These instruments are subject to the IFRS 9 requirements for impairment.

The Group does not hold debt instruments at fair value through equity.

iii. Equity instruments measured at fair value through equity

Equity instruments are recorded at fair value through profit or loss, except in the case of an irrevocable option
for fair value measurement through non-recyclable equity (provided these instruments are not held for trading)
without subsequent reclassification in profit or loss.

Equity instruments at fair value through equity are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Unrealised and realised impairment losses remain recognised in equity without ever affecting the result. These
financial assets are not impaired. In the event of a sale, changes in fair value are not transferred to profit but
directly to the consolidated reserves in equity. Only dividends affect the result if they correspond to a return on
the investment. They are recorded under “Finance income”. The fair value corresponds, for quoted securities, to
a market price. For unlisted securities, it is determined by reference to recent transactions or by valuation


-----

techniques that incorporate reliable and observable market data.

The Group does not hold equity instruments at fair value through equity.

iv. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss

All other financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss. These financial assets include financial
assets held for trading, financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss and non-basic assets. These
assets are measured at fair value with changes in value recorded in profit or loss.

This category also includes derivative financial instruments (positive fair values).

When classified as current assets in cash equivalents, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include,
in particular, units of cash UCITS.

Impairment

Pursuant to the provisions of IFRS 9, financial instruments measured at amortised cost and debt instruments at
fair value through equity are recognised, as at the date of first recognition, as a write-down for expected credit
losses (Expected Credit Losses or ECL). Where the financial assets concerned have not been subject to objective
indications of individual impairment losses, the depreciation for expected credit losses is evaluated on the basis
of historical losses and reasonable and justifiable forecasts of future cash flows.

Financial instruments are divided into three categories according to the deterioration in credit risk observed
since their initial recognition: S1 (no significant increase in credit risk), S2 (significant increase in credit risk) and
S3 (credit risk proven). Each credit category has a specific credit risk assessment method: expected credit losses
at 1 year for outstanding S1, credit losses expected at maturity for outstanding amounts of S2 and S3.

With regard to impairment, IFRS 9 provides for the possibility of adopting a simplified approach for trade
receivables: impairment losses are determined on the basis of the expected loss at maturity and do not require
monitoring of changes in the credit quality category of the receivable. The Group has adopted the simplified
approach for trade receivables. Impairment losses are estimated based on an impairment matrix based on
historical credit default rates over the expected life of the receivables.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities include, in accordance with IFRS 9:

i. Borrowings

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost
according to the effective interest rate method.

For financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate, interest costs are recognised at a constant interest rate
until maturity of the debt using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that
exactly discounts all of the contractual cash flows due on the debt until its maturity. These cash flows are
calculated on the basis of the estimated cash flows due on each instrument constituting the debt. The calculation
takes into account the transaction related costs and all other premiums and discounts.

For financial liabilities that are at a variable interest rate, cash flows are periodically re-estimated to reflect
changes in market interest rates, thereby changing the effective interest rate.

For financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate indexed to inflation, cash flows are periodically re-estimated
to take account of actual fluctuations in the inflation rate, thereby changing the effective interest rate.

A substantial change in the terms of all or part of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an
extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially
different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of
any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, differs by at least 10% of the
discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. If a modification of terms
is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or unamortised fees are recognised in the income statement
on the extinguishment. The amendment to IFRS 9 of 12 October 2017 clarified the treatment under IFRS 9 of
changes in liabilities recognised at amortised cost, in the event that the change does not result in derecognition:
the gain or loss resulting from the difference between the original cash flows and the modified cash flows
discounted at the original effective interest rate should be recorded in profit or loss.

ii. Interest rate hedging instruments

All the derivative instruments are designed to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. They are measured at market
value and are used as cash flow hedges.

Cash flow hedges: the derivative instruments designed to hedge the floating rate element of the debt are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The portion of the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value
that is deemed to be an effective hedge is taken directly to equity until the underlying transaction is recognised
in the Group’s financial statements. The portion deemed ineffective is accounted for in the income statement for
the period. The gains and losses included in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period when the


-----

hedged item affects the income statement. The interest rate hedging instruments described in note G.1.2.c on
financial liabilities, meet the criteria set out in IFRS 9 and are therefore accounted for as cash flow hedges.

**Net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument**

Interest income and charges recognised in profit or loss include:

Interest on the financial assets and liabilities accounted for at amortised cost and at fair value through equity (debt
instruments) using the effective interest rate method. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all
commissions and margins payable or receivable between the contracting parties which are an integral part of the
effective interest rate, and all transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts. The transaction costs are the
marginal costs directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial asset or liability.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives categorised as hedges (for the ineffective portion).


###### G.1 Description of the loans

**G.1.1** **Senior Secured Notes issued as Green Bonds**

Getlink SE issued €700 million 3.50% Senior Secured Notes (the “2025 Green Bonds”) on 30 October 2020 (the “Offering”).
The 2025 Green Bonds are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange (trading as Euronext Dublin) and are admitted
to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. The 2025 Green Bonds align with the International Capital Markets
Association’s (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018 and Loan Market Association’s (LMA) Green Loan Principles 2020 and
therefore they fall into the category of “green” financing.

The 2025 Green Bonds are governed by an English law trust deed (the “Trust Deed”) between Getlink SE and BNY Mellon
Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee for the holders of the 2025 Green Bonds.

The 2025 Green Bonds are due on 30 October 2025 and interest thereon is payable semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and
30 December of each year, commencing on 30 December 2020.

Pursuant to the Trust Deed, €25,252,500 was paid into a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) corresponding to one year of
interest on the 2025 Green Bonds and a one-year commitment fee on the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
described in note G.7 below.

The fees directly attributable to the transaction amounting to €10.5 million are amortised over the life of the 2025 Green
Bonds. The effective interest rate of the 2025 Green Bonds was 3.71% at 31 December 2020.

As at 31 December 2020, the 2025 Green Bonds were rated BB- by S&P and BB+ by Fitch.

**Permitted use of proceeds of the Offering**

In accordance with the offering memorandum relating to the Offering, the Group (i) used a portion of the net proceeds
therefrom to redeem its €550.0 million 3.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 and pay applicable redemption premium and
accrued, but unpaid, interest thereon; and (ii) is allowed to use the remaining portion of such net proceeds to finance capital
expenditure in relation to ElecLink and/or other Eligible Green Assets.

In accordance with its Green Finance Framework, Getlink will prepare and publish a Green Finance Allocation Report within
one year of the issuance of the 2025 Green Bonds and annually thereafter until full allocation of the amount equal to the net
proceeds of the Offering. This report will provide information on the allocation and environmental impact of the 2025 Green
Bonds issued.

**Security and ranking**

The 2025 Green Bonds are subject to an English law intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) between, inter
alios, Getlink SE and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as security agent. The 2025 Green Bonds are secured
by first ranking liens (the “Notes Security”) on (i) all shares in the capital of Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Ltd; and (ii)
a debt service reserve account set up by the Group (the “DSRA”).

The 2025 Green Bonds:

are general senior obligations of Getlink SE;

rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior indebtedness of Getlink SE that is not expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the 2025 Green Bonds;

are secured on an equal and rateable basis with certain other pari passu obligations of Getlink SE by a first priority lien
on the Notes Security; provided, however, that pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of
any collection, sale, disposition or other realisation of the Notes Security received in connection with the exercise of
remedies will be applied first to repay any super senior liabilities prior to the 2025 Green Bonds and any other pari passu
obligations of Getlink SE;

rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Getlink SE;

are effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured indebtedness of Getlink SE to the extent of the value of the
Notes Security;


-----

are effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of Getlink SE that is secured by liens on property or
assets that do not secure the 2025 Green Bonds, to the extent of the value of such property or assets so securing such
indebtedness; and

are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including
interest payables, trade payables and lease obligations) of Getlink SE’s subsidiaries (including the Term Loan).

**Redemption**

Optional redemption

The 2025 Green Bonds may be redeemed at any time prior to 30 October 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any,
to the redemption date, plus the applicable “make whole” premium.

In addition, at any time prior to 30 October 2022, Getlink SE may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
the 2025 Green Bonds using the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price of 103.500% of the
principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any,
to the redemption date.

At any time on or after 30 October 2022, Getlink SE may redeem the 2025 Green Bonds at the following redemption prices,
expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on 30 October: 2022:
101.75%, 2023: 100.875% or without a premium in or after 2024.

The 2025 Green Bonds may also be redeemed upon the occurrence of certain tax events.

Repurchase upon a change of control

If an event treated as a change of control triggering event occurs, then each holder of the 2025 Green Bonds has the right
to require that Getlink SE repurchase all or part of such holder’s 2025 Green Bonds at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase.

Mandatory redemption

If Getlink SE disposes of its shares in Eurotunnel Holding SAS to a third party in accordance with the requirements of law or
a governmental authority, it shall apply the net cash proceeds of such disposal to (i) first, repay the amounts outstanding
under the Term Loan and (ii) second, redeem all outstanding 2025 Green Bonds at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase.

**Covenants**

The Trust Deed provides for certain incurrence covenants that are customary for this type of financing. These covenants are
only tested upon the occurrence of an event, rather than on an on-going basis. Unless certain conditions are respected,
certain prohibitions apply in relation to:

The incurrence of additional debt: for example, additional debt can be incurred as long as, on a pro forma basis, the
Group’s (a) Total Net Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than (i) 9.0 to 1.0 until, and including, 30 June 2022 and (ii) 8.0 to
1.0 from, and including, 1 July 2022; and (b) Debt Service Cover Ratio (DSCR) is equal to or greater than 1.25 to 1.0. In
addition, there are certain types of debt that can be incurred irrespective of whether there is ratio debt capacity at all.
These include a €100 million Revolving Credit Facility at Getlink SE of which €75 million was committed but undrawn as
at 31 December 2020; a €50 million basket to finance the activities of GET Elec Limited, ElecLink Ltd or any of their
respective subsidiaries; a €50 million basket to finance the activities of Europorte SAS or any of its subsidiaries; and a
basket of up to €400 million to finance the activities of Getlink SE or any of its subsidiaries.

The making of certain restricted payments, including dividend distributions and purchases of treasury shares. Any such
restricted payments will be permitted if (i) there is no event of default or ii) if the DSCR is greater than 1.25; and (iii) there
is sufficient cash on the DSRA. Any restricted payments using the proceeds of a Europorte sale and restricted payments
in the aggregate amount not to exceed €300 million (and €150 million in each year), are not subject to the DSCR
restriction above.

Other operations, including certain sales of assets, granting of certain liens and consummation of certain merger and
consolidation transactions.

As is customary for financings of this type, there are a number of exceptions to the incurrence covenants noted above that
are aimed to ensure that the Group has sufficient flexibility to operate its business.

In addition, the Trust Deed provides for the establishment of the DSRA and certain requirements as to crediting cash on it.


-----

**Events of default**

Key events of default applicable to the 2025 Green Bonds and listed in the Trust Deed are set out below:

a failure to pay principal when due;

a failure for more than 30 days to pay interest when due;

a failure for more than 60 days after receipt of a notice from the trustee or holders of at least 25% of the aggregate
principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds outstanding to comply with other covenants or agreements in the Trust Deed;

a cross-acceleration or payment default under certain other indebtedness;

a failure to pay certain final judgments;

an impairment of Notes Security above a certain value; and

certain customary bankruptcy and insolvency events of default.

**G.1.2** **Term Loan**

During its financial restructuring in June 2007, the Group put in place long-term loans of £1.5 billion and €2 billion
(collectively known as the “Term Loan”). This loan comprised tranches index-linked to inflation (tranche A), fixed rate tranches
(tranche B) and variable rate tranches (tranche C) with maturities varying between 2041 and 2050. In August 2007, all the
tranches of the loan were purchased by a debt securitisation vehicle created for the purpose by the lenders, Channel Link
Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF). Certain of the notes issued by CLEF as part of this securitisation were guaranteed by three
monolines who, in return for their guarantee, received a commission over the life of the loans.

On 24 December 2015, the Group concluded an operation that led to the withdrawal of two of the three monolines from
their roles as guarantors of the CLEF notes. This operation led to changes to the structure of the Term Loan and to certain
of its terms, such as the division of the index-linked tranches in to six new tranches and the reduction in the contractual
interest rate for some tranches by 0.6%. The fees incurred for this operation totalling €123 million (at the 2015 exchange
rate) have been accounted for on the statement of financial position under “other financial liabilities”. The remaining fees
amounting to €31 million at 31 December 2020 will be paid over the remaining life of the tranche A loans (see note G.4
below).

On 6 June 2017, the Group completed the partial refinancing of its debt which consisted of the refinancing of the C tranches
of the debt and the partial termination of the corresponding hedging contracts, the raising of additional debt of €602 million
in order to finance the costs of the partial termination of the hedging contracts and other costs of the operation, and the
redemption of the floating rate notes held by the Group on its statement of financial position as “Other financial assets”. As
a result of this operation, the structure and certain conditions of the Term Loan were modified, in particular the division of
the C1 and C2 tranches into six new tranches, the reduction of annual interest payments of approximately €50 million and
of financial charges to the income statement of approximately €7 million per year over five-year period 2017-2022, as well
as the decrease of the average annual cost of the Term Loan excluding indexation to below 4% over the same period.

The total cumulative contractual repayments (excluding repayments of the indexation on Tranche A) on the Term Loan made
by the Group to 31 December 2020 amount to €305 million.

The effective rate of interest includes costs directly attributable to the debt. The effective rate of the A tranches also includes
the impact of the indexation of the nominal value. The transaction costs used for the determination of the effective interest
rate at 31 December 2020 correspond to:

the issue costs of the Term Loan in 2007 remaining to be amortised amounting to €25 million,

the fees for the renegotiation of the A tranches completed in December 2015 remaining to be amortised amounting to
€88 million,

the costs of the refinancing transaction on the C tranches in June 2017 remaining to be amortised amounting to
€12 million, and

the issue costs of the 2025 Green Bonds in October 2020 remaining to be amortised amounting to €10 million.

These costs relate mainly to financing, legal and bank fees.

**b)** **Principal provisions of the Term Loan**

**Undertakings and prohibitions under the Term Loan**

The Term Loan provides for a number of undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for this type of financing. These
relate to:

the creation of new or the continuation of existing guarantees on the assets of the Eurotunnel Holding SAS sub-group
(“Eurotunnel”). As Eurotunnel Holding SAS replaced Getlink SE as parent under the Term Loan on 13 April 2018, the
securities initially granted by Getlink SE were released and new securities, relating to the same assets, were granted by
Eurotunnel Holding SAS on 13 April 2018;

to the transfer of Eurotunnel’s assets and to the acquisition by Eurotunnel of new assets;

to the granting of loans, guarantees or warranties to third parties; and

the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent for utilisation of the loans under the Term Loan, including
inter alia the Railway Usage Contract.


-----

**Financial covenants**

Under the terms of the Term Loan, Eurotunnel must comply with two financial ratios.

Senior debt service cover ratio

Eurotunnel is required to ensure that at each six-monthly test date after 31 December 2007, a ratio of operating cash flow
to total debt service on the Term Loan is not less than 1.10, such ratio being calculated by reference to a rolling 12 month
period preceding the testing date. Failure to respect this first ratio would constitute an event of default (see paragraph “Event
of default and acceleration” below).

In the context of the health crisis and as a precautionary measure, on 17 October 2020, the Group secured a waiver on this
covenant from its creditors which will apply for the three test dates between December 2020 and December 2021 inclusive,
unless the Group decides that such a waiver is not required no later than two months before one of the dates in question.
The waiver is subject to certain conditions, including the holding of a minimum cash balance at the level of the Eurotunnel
sub-group of €200 million at the relevant dates. At 31 December 2020, the cash held by the Eurotunnel sub-group totalled
€330 million.

Synthetic debt service cover ratio

The second ratio is the lower, on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test, of:

the ratio of operating cash flow to the total debt service on the Term Loan including the additional margin applied to
tranche C of the debt since 2012, and

the ratio of operating cash flow to the total debt service on the Term Loan taking into account the hypothetical
amortisation on the Term Loan.

Eurotunnel is required to ensure that at each six-monthly test date since 31 December 2007, this ratio is not less than 1.25.
Failure to meet this ratio on a six-monthly testing date would lead to restrictions on the use of the Eurotunnel’s excess
available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the Term Loan until such time as the test is met once again.
These restrictions include, in particular, the ability of Eurotunnel to pay dividends and to finance new activities. Failure to
meet this test on three consecutive six monthly testing dates would trigger a prepayment event, under which the Eurotunnel’s
excess available cash flow would have to be used towards prepayment of the Term Loan until the testing date on which the
ratio is met once again.

**Voluntary prepayment of the Term Loan**

Clause 7.2 of the credit agreements provide for voluntary prepayments to be made on the Term Loan for a minimum amount
of £5 million or €7.5 million, without penalties but subject to the payment of certain market standard prepayment premia.

**Guarantees and security relating to the Term Loan**

Guarantees:

Under the Intercreditor Deed, Eurotunnel’s main companies each jointly and severally guarantee the obligations of FM and
CTG as borrowers of the Term Loan vis-à-vis the lenders, the arrangers and the hedging counterparties of the Term Loan.

Security granted by Eurotunnel under French law:

assignment of trade receivables by way of security under which (i) FM assigns the receivables held by it under the
Concession Agreement and the Railways Usage Contract as well as its trade receivables held by it against the freight
transporters and coach operators, its insurance receivables and the intercompany receivables held by it against the French
companies of Eurotunnel, (ii) CTG assigns the same categories of receivables as FM with the exception of trade receivables
owed by the freight transporters and coach operators and (iii) other members of the Eurotunnel sub-group qualifying as
guarantors assign their insurance receivables and intercompany receivables held against Eurotunnel’s French companies;

unregistered mortgages over FM’s main real estate assets that are not the subject of short-or medium-term development
projects;

a registered pledge over FM’s rolling stock;

a pledge on all bank and investment accounts open in France under the name of any borrower or guarantor of the Term
Loan;

a pledge on shares in the Eurotunnel sub-group members held by the borrowers or guarantors of the Term Loan;

a pledge on the main Eurotunnel trademarks;

a pledge on receivables held by FM under certain pieces of land comprised in the “ZAC 1” and which is the subject of
long term construction leases (baux à construction);

a pledge on receivables held by Eurotunnel against FM pursuant to the bonds facility agreement dated 28 June 2007 (as
amended on 29 August 2007) and entered into, inter alia, between Eurotunnel as lender and FM as borrower; and

a pledge over their rights held in connection with the GIE (groupement d’intérêt économique) by Eurotunnel Holding
SAS, FM, CTG and Eurotunnel SE.


-----

Security granted by Eurotunnel under English law:

The main Eurotunnel companies grant security over all of their assets held at the date of execution of the Term Loan as well
as over their future assets and over certain of their contractual rights.

Security over the other Eurotunnel assets:

All of the shares of Eurotunnel member companies that are not subject to security as described above are pledged by way
of security for the obligations of the borrowers under the Term Loan and guarantors under the Intercreditor Deed.

**Event of default and acceleration**

The Term Loan contains a number of events of default which, in certain instances subject to grace periods, permit the lenders
to declare the Term Loan immediately due and payable, to enforce the security, and/or to demand the implementation of
the substitution mechanism provided for under the terms of the Concession.

The events of default include:

any non-payment under the Term Loan;

a failure to comply with any provision of the Term Loan, the Intercreditor Deed or related documents. These provisions
impose restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, acquisitions, disposals and other transfers, mergers,
borrowings, and the granting of guarantees and new security by the companies of Eurotunnel, and include, in particular:

   - a financial covenant in respect of the senior debt service cover ratio (see paragraph “Financial covenants – Senior
debt service cover ratio” above; and

   - certain undertakings and representations relating to the tax treatment of Eurotunnel to the extent that a breach is
reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of FM, CTG or Eurotunnel;

a representation or warranty is made or deemed to have been made by a borrower or a guarantor under the terms of
the Term Loan, or any related finance document or any other document delivered by or on behalf of a borrower or an
obligor under the terms of the finance documents (which contain representations and warranties that are customary for
this type of document), which proves to have been incorrect or misleading at the time at which it was made or deemed
to have been made;

the occurrence of a cross default under any other indebtedness in excess of a specified amount of any of the companies
within Eurotunnel;

the inability of any borrower or guarantor to pay its debts as they fall due, the insolvency or the opening of any legal
proceedings in relation to any borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan;

the illegality or invalidity of the Term Loan, any related security or the subordination created under the Intercreditor
Deed;

Eurotunnel becoming permanently unable to carry on the business of operating the Tunnel, the destruction of the Tunnel,
or the cessation of a material part of its business by a borrower or a guarantor;

a guarantor ceasing to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eurotunnel Holding SAS;

any act or omission of France or the United Kingdom which renders a borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan
incapable of performing its obligations under the Term Loan and associated documents; and

the occurrence of litigation (or similar proceedings) against a Eurotunnel member or its assets, which is reasonably likely
(i) to be adversely determined against the relevant company and (ii) to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of FM, CTG or Eurotunnel.

The Term Loan also includes other events of default which are customary for this type of financing.

**c)** **Hedging instruments**

In 2007, the Group put in place hedging contracts to cover its floating rate loans (tranches C1 and C2) in the form of swaps
for the same duration and for the same value (EURIBOR against a fixed rate of 4.90% and LIBOR against a fixed rate of 5.26%).
The nominal value of the cash flow hedging swap is €953 million and £350 million. These derivatives were partially terminated
as part of the refinancing of tranche C in June 2017 as set out in note G.1.2 above.

During 2020, Deutsche Bank, which holds 50% of these hedging contracts, novated part of its portfolio of hedging contracts,
including those in place with the Group, to new counterparties. The transaction was concluded on 4 August 2020, and as a
result those of the Group’s hedging contracts that were previously held by Deutsche Bank, were transferred to three new
counterparties. The terms and conditions of these hedging contracts remain unchanged following their novation, in
accordance with the terms of the credit agreements entered into in 2007.


-----

These derivatives generated a charge of €56,696,000 in 2020 which was accounted for in the income statement (2019: charge
of €56,884,000).

These derivatives have been accounted for at their fair value as liabilities on the statement of financial position as follows:

In accordance with IFRS 13, the Group takes into account credit risk (DVA) and counterparty risk (CVA) in the valuation of
financial instruments. In practice, this recommendation particularly affects the valuation of derivatives to the extent that they
are measured at fair value including a probabilistic weighting of estimated cash flows.

In the case of a default by the Group, counterparties to the hedging contracts have priority over all holders of debt and
securities and guarantees granted to holders of debt under the Concession Agreement and the Intercreditor Deed. In this
respect, the Group believes that the risk of loss for the counterparties in the event of default is insignificant and therefore
has not recorded a discount to the fair value of hedging instruments under the DVA.

The table in note G.10.2 below gives the periods in which the cash flows associated with the derivatives are expected to
occur, and the periods in which the amounts initially recognised in equity are expected to impact the income statement.

**G.1.3** **Other loans**

“Financial assets measured at amortised cost”.

The G2 notes, which have a nominal value of £150 million indexed on UK inflation, correspond to the securitisation of tranche
A2 of the Group’s debt and have the same characteristics in terms of interest and maturity as the A2 tranche. The difference
between the fair value of the G2 notes at their acquisition date and their nominal value indexed at the same date is being
amortised to the income statement over the remaining term until their final maturity.

###### G.9 Matrix of class of financial instrument and recognition categories and fair value


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Measurement of fair value**

Trade and other receivables

The fair value of trade and other receivables is measured on the basis of their expected recoverable value.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities less than or equal to three months
from date of acquisition which do not carry a significant risk of variation in value and which are used by the Group to
manage short term commitments. Money market funds are evaluated at their market value at the end of the reporting
period.

Financial instruments

Financial assets accounted for at their fair value are classified in accordance with the following levels of fair value:

Level 1: fair value using quoted prices (unadjusted) observed in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: fair value using data (“inputs”) other than quoted prices included in level 1, which are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (in the form of price) or indirectly (determined from the price).

Level 3: fair value from valuation techniques which rely completely or in part on non-observable data such as prices
on an inactive market or the valuation on a multiples basis for non-quoted securities.

Derivative instruments

The fair value of hedging instruments is measured by discounting contractual future cash flows and integrating the credit
risk (CVA) or the counterparty risk (DVA).


The table below presents the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and their level in the
hierarchy of fair value. It does not include information about the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are
not measured at fair value and for which the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

**Fair value of financial assets**

Fair value of the G2 inflation-indexed notes

The fair value of the G2 notes as of 31 December 2020 has been estimated by applying the same methodology used on their
initial recognition, namely the discounting of the future cash flows of the instruments by applying discounting factors derived
from a zero-coupon curve and a credit spread determined from the spread of the C1 tranche of the Term Loan compared to
the risk-free rate in the United Kingdom, i.e. a spread at 31 December 2020 of 190 basis points.

On this basis, the Group estimates the fair value of the G2 notes to be £300 million 31 December 2020, an amount equivalent
to their accounting value.

**Fair value of financial liabilities**

Fair value of the 2025 Green Bonds

As at 31 December 2020, the fair value of the 2025 Green Bonds was estimated on the basis of observable data in an active
OTC market. The 2025 Green Bonds are classified in fair value level two.

The Group estimates the fair value of the 2025 Green Bonds to be €725 million at 31 December 2020, compared to a carrying
value of €690 million, i.e. 105% of their carrying value.

Fair value of the Term Loan

On 28 June 2007, the Group took out the Term Loan for £1.5 billion and €2 billion with a spread of 139 basis points. On 28
June 2012, the margin on the C1 and C2 tranches of the Term Loan was 339 basis points. This debt is accounted for at its
amortised cost.

The Term Loan is not quoted or traded on an active financial market and it is particularly difficult to identify any observable
market equivalents, taking into account the specificities and characteristics of the Term Loan and in particular its 30 to 40year maturity profile (see note G.10.2 below).

The Term Loan is classified in fair value level three.

The fair value of the Term Loan as at 31 December 2020 is estimated on the basis of the discounting of the future cash flows
of the debt service, and by applying discounting factors deducted from a zero-coupon curve and a credit spread determined
from the spread of the C tranche of the debt compared to the risk-free rates, i.e. a spread at 31 December 2020 of 190 basis
points in the United Kingdom and 337 basis points in France. This spread was corroborated against credit spreads observed
in companies with the same rating as Eurotunnel and for a debt with a maturity of more than 30 years.

On this basis, the Group estimates the fair value of the Term Loan to be €5,308 million compared to a carrying value of
€4,206 million at 31 December 2020. As an indication, if the rate used (including the credit spread) was 100 basis points
higher, the fair value of the Term Loan would be approximately €656 million lower. The characteristics of the current funding
agreements include any prepayment or refinancing operations on the Term Loan.


-----

Fair value of the hedging instruments

The characteristics of the Group’s hedging instruments and the estimate of their fair value as at 31 December 2020 are set
out in note G.1.2.c above.

The fair value of the hedging instruments is calculated on the basis of mathematical models integrating the discounting of
the contractual flows linked to these instruments based on observable market data, in particular forward rate curves. The
discount rates are determined from zero-coupon curves.

Hedging instruments are classified in fair value level two.

The estimated fair value of the hedging instruments as determined by the Group is corroborated against the valuations
provided by the financial counterparties.

The sensitivity analyses of the fair value of these instruments to changes in interest rates are set out in note G.10.3 below.

###### G.10 Financial risks

**G.10.1** **Exchange rate exposure**

Getlink SE prepares its consolidated accounts in euros. Fluctuations in the value of the sterling/euro rates have an impact on
the value in euros of revenues, costs and financial income and costs, as well as on elements of the Group’s reported assets
and liabilities. By way of example and all else being equal and on the basis of accounting information at 31 December 2020,
the table below presents the effect that a change of plus or minus 10% in the exchange rate would have on the main financial
indicators.

€ million **2020** **2019**

Equity 1.112 1,372 1,198 1,546 1.175 1,639 1,448 1,830

Approximately half of the Group’s revenues are denominated in sterling, whereas more than half of its operating expenses
and capital expenditure are paid in euros.

The Term Loan is denominated in sterling for a total of £1.704 billion and in euros for a total of €2.031 billion at 31 December
2020. All the external financial instruments, which hedge the Term Loan, are denominated either in sterling or in euros. As a
result, no exchange gain or loss can arise on revaluation of the external financial instruments. At 31 December 2020, the
residual foreign exchange risk mainly relates to cash assets held in foreign currencies of €69 million and a liability on the
revaluation of intra-Group receivables and payables of €50 million; a 10% change in the euro/sterling parity would result in
unrealised exchange gains or losses of approximately €2 million.

The Group seeks to improve the match the currencies in which its revenues and costs are denominated and has used and
will use currency hedging transactions to manage its foreign exchange risk where necessary.

In addition:

the Trust Deed of October 2020 allows Getlink SE to raise additional debt subject to certain conditions as described in
note G.1.1 above, and

the credit agreements for the Term Loan allow, on condition that the debt service cover ratio is not less than 1.25, to
apply for (i) a renewable credit line of up to €75 million, and (ii) a structurally subordinated unsecured additional credit
line of up to £225 million (or equivalent in euros).


-----

**G.10.3** **Interest rate risk exposure**

The risk of an unfavourable movement in interest rates during the duration of the Term Loan is covered by the fact that the
B tranches are at a fixed rate of interest, the A tranches which are indexed on inflation are at a fixed rate of interest, and the
C tranches are at a fixed rate of interest (tranches C1a, C2a and C2b will revert to a variable rate of interest in 2029, 2022 and
2027 respectively but will be covered by fixed/variable rate hedging contracts). The Green Bonds carry a fixed rate of interest.
Short-term receivables and debts are not at risk from interest rate exposure.

The contractual cash flows associated with the swaps are paid simultaneously with the contractual cash flows of the variable
rate loans and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period where the interest on the variablerate debt affects the result.

An increase of 1% in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the derivative instruments
of €189 million. A decrease of 1% in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the
derivative instruments of €230 million.

**G.10.4** **Inflation risk**

The inflation risk relates to the interest and the repayments of principal on the indexed tranches of the Term Loan (A1 to A6)
denominated in pounds and euros. By way of example, a variation of 1% in the inflation rate would have an impact of €15
million on the amount of the principal of these tranches.

**G.10.5** **Credit risks**

Credit risk represents the risk of financial loss to the Group in the event that a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to honour its contractual obligations.

**Trade receivables**

The Group’s exposure to customer credit risk arises from its customers in the United Kingdom and Eurozone countries, with
the following exceptions:

the Group’s main customers, the Railways, accounted for 20% of the Group’s revenue in 2020, and

Passenger Shuttle car customers pay for their tickets in advance, in particular via the internet; consequently, the credit
risk in relation to these customers is very limited.

The Group applies a credit policy which requires that every new customer is subject to a credit check before being able to
benefit from the Group’s standard credit terms. The Group’s credit risk exposure to account customers is managed by means
of continuous monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in regard to their credit limits and payment
terms.

**Investments**

The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in (i) term deposits and certificates of deposit with a maximum
maturity of 12 months, and with counterparties with a short-term rating of at least P-1 and a long-term rating of at least A2
from Moody’s, and (ii) money market funds with a long-term rating of AAA from S&P or Aaa from Moody’s.

Funds invested by the Group in any one monetary SICAV or money market fund should not exceed £100 million per SICAV
or fund in pounds sterling or €120 million per fund or SICAV in euros. Investments in short term deposits or certificates of
deposit should not exceed £83 million or €100 million with any one bank group. In the event of an increase in euro liquidity,
the Group may have to temporarily increase the limits with its three main retail banks to €150 million.

**Credit risk exposure**

The carrying value of the financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure. The maximum credit risk exposure at
the end of the reporting period is as follows:

###### G.11 IBOR transition

A reform of the main reference rates is under way with the replacement of interbank interest rates (IBOR - Interbank Offered
Rates) by alternative risk-free reference rates (Risk Free Rate).

The Group has organised itself for a gradual transition to risk-free rates by associating the finance, legal and risk functions
and remains attentive to the work of the market and the publications of the various bodies, particularly the IFRIC and the
IASB.

For the Group, this reform is likely to affect certain financial instruments (tranche C1a of the Term Loan which has nominal
value of £350 million) and its related hedging contracts which have a nominal value of £350 million and, to a lesser extent,
certain commercial contracts (interest on late payments, etc.).

In this context, the IASB has published several amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, of which phase one was adopted on 15
January 2020, and is applicable from 1 January 2020, allowing hedging relationships to be maintained until the transition
becomes effective.

Finally, this rate transition has no impact on the Group's 2020 financial statements.

###### H. Share capital and earnings per share

 H.1 Share capital

**H.1.1** **Management of capital**

The Group’s policy is to maintain a solid capital base in order to retain the confidence of investors, creditors and of the
market and to support the future development of the activity. Capital can include the share capital, share premium and
retained earnings. The Board monitors return on equity and the level of dividends paid to shareholders.

The Group buys its own shares on the market. The timing of these purchases depends on the market price. These transactions
are carried out as part of the share buyback programme of which the liquidity contract is part (see note H.1.3 below).

During the year, the Group has not changed its policy on the management of capital.

**H.1.3** **Treasury shares**


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

Getlink SE shares held by the Group are accounted for at cost as a reduction in equity. Subsequent disposals are taken
directly to equity and no profit or loss is recognised.

**At 31 December 2020** **11,595,861** **381,499** **11,977,360**

Treasury shares held as part of the share buyback programme approved by the General Meetings of shareholders and
implemented by decisions of the Board of Directors are allocated, in particular, to cover share option plans and the grant of
free shares.

As part of the 2020 share buyback programme, Getlink SE has continued to implement the liquidity contract concluded with
Oddo BHF on 18 May 2010. Under the terms of this contract, Getlink SE has mandated Oddo BHF to intervene on its behalf
on the market in order to promote the liquidity of transactions and the stabilisation of price of Getlink SE’s shares and to
avoid price discrepancies not justified by market trends. In 2019, Getlink and Oddo BHF updated the liquidity contract to
reflect changes in the regulations in force. The terms of the updated contract comply with the standard liquidity contract
established by AMAFI (Association Française des Marchés Financiers). As of 31 December 2020, the balance of the liquidity
contract included the following resources: 381,499 Getlink SE shares and €11,204,769.87 in cash. Based on a share price of
€14.18 per share, this combined amount represents 0.21% of Getlink SE's outstanding share capital as of 31 December 2020.

above; and

on the assumption of the acquisition of all the preference shares allocated to staff and still in issue at 31 December 2020.
Conversion of these preference shares is subject to achieving certain targets and remaining in the Group’s employment
as described in note E.5.3 above.

###### I. Income tax expense


**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Income tax**

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted
at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except as provided by IAS 12 “Income Taxes”.

The tax rates used are those in effect at the end of the reporting period.

Net deferred tax is determined at the level of each tax group.

Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient
future taxable profits will be available against which the differences can be used, at the level of the tax entity.

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are recognised according to the likelihood of their recoverability assessed on
the basis of the Group’s budget and medium-term plans. The assumptions in these plans used are the same as those used
for testing the value of assets.


-----

###### I.1 Effect on the income statement

**I.1.1** **Tax provisions of the Concession Agreement and other provisions**

The Concession requires that the Group’s Concessionaires (CTG and FM) share equally the cost price of the project and all
revenues and costs relating to the operation of the Fixed Link between the British and French companies. Operating revenues
and costs are recognised in the income statement of the partnership and are shared equally between the Concessionaires.
Revenues and costs which do not relate to the operation of the Concession are not subject to these sharing arrangements.

Article 34 of the French Finance Act for 2019 (no. 2018-1317 of 28 December 2018) renewed the exclusion of financial
expenses borne by concessionaires relating to assets acquired or built by them under a concession contract from the scope
of the mechanism limiting the deductibility of financial expenses.

**I.1.2** **Tax accounted for through the income statement**

**Total current tax** **(223)** **(3,049)**

The current tax charge relates to amounts paid or to be paid in the short term to the tax authorities for the year according
to the rules in force in the different countries and specific conventions.

**Income tax** **(313)** **2,015**

For the French tax group at 31 December 2020, the tax proof has been prepared for the 2020 financial year on the basis of
the tax rate in force of 32.01%. However, since the main reversals of temporary differences are planned beyond the period
of application, the deferred tax on the French tax group was calculated taking into account the rates applicable between
2021 and 2025.

For the British tax group, in view of its not being fiscally profitable at 31 December 2019 or at 31 December 2020, deferred
tax was calculated for the years 2021 to 2025 on the basis of the Group's estimates using the rates applicable between 2021
and 2025.

**Net tax assets/(liabilities)** **204,638** **202,878** **(90)** **(3,230)** **(8,387)** **191,171**

**Property, plant and equipment**

The impact of taxation on property, plant and equipment corresponds mainly to the conditions relating to the deductibility
of the Eurotunnel segment’s depreciation costs in the French tax group (reintegration of impairment costs) and in the British
tax group (profile of tax deductions in respect of depreciation, including capital allowances).

Deferred tax resulting from temporary differences on property, plant and equipment will reverse over the period until the
end of the Concession in line with the profile of the Group’s depreciation charges and taxable results.

**Profit arising from restructuring**

The financial restructuring in 2007 gave rise to profit in the consolidated accounts of €3,323 million. At 31 December 2020,
the taxation of €1,364 million of this amount remains deferred within the French tax group. The taxation of this residual
profit is dependent upon the repayment of a loan between the Concessionaires (FM and CTG) and Eurotunnel Holding SAS,
which in turn is subordinated to the Term Loan which matures in 2050.

**Hedging contracts**

At 31 December 2020, the Group recognised in equity a deferred tax asset amounting to €65 million for future recycling to
the income statement from the revaluation reserve for the hedging contracts that were partially terminated as part of the
debt refinancing operation in 2017 (see note G.1.2 above).

**Deferred tax in respect of tax losses**

Deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses within the French and British tax groups amount to
€408 million at 31 December 2020 (€80 million for the French tax group and €328 million for the British tax group).

The recognition of these assets for each of the tax groups is based on:

The forecasts of taxable profits derived from the Group’s five-year business plan for its different activities; this plan is
based on the same assumptions as those used in the impairment test of assets (see note F.3 above). On the basis of these
forecasts in respect of taxable profits, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of carried forward losses
which are expected to be utilised in the next five years for both the French and British tax groups.

The forecasts for use of carried forward losses to cover the reversal of temporary differences on the British tax group.

Other temporary differences, notably those relating to deferred tax assets on retirement liabilities, are mostly recognised on
a five-year horizon.

Unrecognised temporary differences correspond mainly to a deferred tax asset in respect of that part of the interest rate
hedging contracts which have not been terminated whose reversal is expected beyond the recoverability horizon.

**French carried forward tax losses**

In France, the deficits can be carried forward indefinitely but their allocation to the profit recognised for a financial year is
limited to a ceiling equal to €1 million plus an amount of 50% of the taxable profit for the financial year exceeding this first
limit.

Getlink SE is the parent company of the consolidated tax group which it forms with all the Group’s French subsidiaries.

At 31 December 2020, the cumulative tax losses of the tax group which can be carried forward indefinitely, after adjustments
in 2020, amount to €2,810 million (31 December 2019: €2,716 million), consisting essentially of:

cumulative tax losses which can be carried forward indefinitely of €928 million generated by the Getlink SE consolidated
tax group since 1 January 2008 and chargeable to the taxable profits of the members of this group (31 December 2019:
€832 million);

cumulative tax losses which can be carried forward indefinitely of €1,870 million (31 December 2019: €1,870 million)
generated by the old TNU SA consolidated tax group. These deficits may only be applied to the taxable profits of FM
and Europorte SAS; and

cumulative tax losses which can be carried forward indefinitely by subsidiaries, mainly Europorte France SAS and
EurotunnelPlus SE French branch, amounting to €12 million (31 December 2019: €14 million). These deficits can only be
applied to the taxable profits of the subsidiaries Europorte France SAS and EurotunnelPlus SE France branch.

Potential unrecognised tax assets in respect of the carried forward tax losses of the French tax group amount to €648 million
(on a base of €2,503 million).

**British carried forward tax losses**

In England, the tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely but their allocation to the profit recognised for a financial year
is limited to a ceiling equal to £5 million plus 50% of the taxable profit of the year exceeding this first limit. Tax losses carried
forward from before 1 April 2017 are only attributable to the profits of the entity that generated them. Tax loss carryforwards
arising after 1 April 2017 are chargeable to the profits of all entities of the British tax group.

At 31 December 2020, the tax losses carried forward indefinitely for the British companies amounted to £2,789 million (31
December 2019: £2,775 million).

Potential unrecognised tax assets in respect of the carried forward tax losses of the British tax group amount to €261 million
(on a base of €1,375 million).

###### Report of the statutory auditors on the annual parent company financial statements 

**For the financial year ending 31 December 2020**

This is a translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements of the company issued in
French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users.

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information
about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided
to shareholders.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing
standards applicable in France.


To the Shareholders,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying
financial statements of Getlink SE for the year ended 31 December 2020.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of
the company as at 31 December 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French
accounting principles.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

Audit framework

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report.

Independence

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules provided in the French Commercial Code (code
de commerce) and the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from 1 January
2020 to date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1)
of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014.

**Justification of assessments - key audit matters**

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and
audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary
emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have
led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have
also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.

It is this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the
French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit
matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit
of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.


-----

**Valuation of equity investments and intra-group receivables**

**Identified risk** **Our answer**


Equity investments, which are included in the balance sheet at 31
December 2020 for a net amount of €1,492 million, represent one of
the most significant asset items. They are stated at their acquisition
cost at the date of entry and depreciated, if necessary, on the basis of
their value in use, representing what the company would agree to pay
for them if it had to acquire them. At 31 December 2020, the value of
intra-group loans and receivables from the Group amounted to
€2,742 million.

The value in use was estimated by management based on the various
criteria described in note B.3 to the financial statements. As indicated
in this note, value in use is estimated by management on the basis of
various criteria (net assets, revalued net assets, discounted cash flows
or external valuations).

The estimation of the value in use of these investments requires the
use of management's judgment in selecting the items to be
considered depending on the investments concerned, which may
correspond to accounting items or forecast items (long-term
business plan and economic conditions in the countries under
consideration).

In this context and because of the uncertainties inherent to certain
elements and in particular to the probability of the forecasts being
achieved, we considered that the correct valuation of the equity
investments, related receivables and provisions for risks represented
a key audit matter.

**Specific verifications**


Our work consisted mainly in verifying that the
estimate of value in use determined by
management is based on an appropriate
justification of the valuation method and the
figures used.

So, we ensured that:

 the value in use of investments in Eurotunnel
Holding SAS is assessed taking into account
the Group's latest business plan for the
Concession business;

 the value in use of investments in Europorte
SAS is assessed taking into account the
Group's latest business plan for the Europorte
segment;

 the value in use of investments in EuroTransManche Holding SAS is assessed on the
basis of a net book asset;

 the value in use of all the equity investments
is higher than their net book value.

Finally, our work also consisted in assessing the
recoverability of intra-group loans and receivables.


We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required
by French laws and regulations.

Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the
financial statements provided to the shareholders

We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information
given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position
and the financial statements provided to the shareholders.

We attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment
terms, required under Article D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).

Report on corporate governance

We attest that the Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 22537-4, L. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.

Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code
(code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received or allocated by the directors and any other
commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying
information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your
company from controlled companies that are included in the scope of consolidation. Based on this work, we attest the
accuracy and fair presentation of this information.

Other information

In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders
and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.


-----

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report

In accordance with Article 222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the company’s management informed us of its decision
to postpone the presentation of the financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic format as defined
in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 to years beginning on or after 1 January 2021.
Therefore, this report does not include a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation of the
consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of
the French Monetary and Financial Code (code monétaire et financier).

Appointment of the Statutory Auditors

We were appointed as statutory auditors of Getlink SE (formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE) by the annual general meeting held
on 9 May 2007.

As at 31 December 2020, audit firms KPMG Audit and Mazars were in the 14th year of total uninterrupted engagement.

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French
accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control
and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting
procedures.

The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

**Statutory Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Objectives and audit approach

Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include
assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises
professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal
control.

Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management in the financial statements.

Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt
on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a
going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw
attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided
or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.


-----

Report to the Audit Committee

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit
programme implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control
regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters
that we are required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014,
confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by
Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code
de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

###### Notes to the financial statements 

Getlink SE, formerly Groupe Eurotunnel SE, is the Group’s consolidating entity. Its registered office is at 3 rue La Boétie, 75008
Paris, France and its shares are listed on Euronext Paris. The term “Getlink SE” refers to the holding company which is
governed by French law. The term “Group” refers to Getlink SE and all its subsidiaries.

The main activities of the Group are the design, financing, construction and operation of the Fixed Link’s infrastructure and
transport system in accordance with the terms of the Concession (which will expire in 2086) by the Eurotunnel segment, the
rail freight activity of the Europorte segment as well as the construction and operation (expected mid-2022) of the 1GW
electricity interconnector in the Tunnel. The maritime activity was discontinued in 2015.

Getlink SE provides various services to its subsidiaries such as administrative and financial management, corporate strategy
and shareholder relations. In 2020, Getlink SE charged its subsidiaries €23.1 million for these services, of which €19.1 million
was charged to Eurotunnel Holding SAS.

###### A. Important events

 A.1. Issue of Senior Secured Notes, the “2025 Green Bonds”

On 30 October 2020, Getlink SE completed the issue of €700 million Senior Secured Notes (the “2025 Green Bonds”). The
bonds were issued at par, bear interest at an annual rate of 3.50% and will mature in October 2025.

The net proceeds of this issue were used in particular to redeem the bonds issued in 2018 and the additional cash raised will
be used to finance the ElecLink project and other “green” investments.

Information on the 2025 Green Bonds and the conditions attached thereto is detailed in note F.1 below.

###### A.2. Covid-19 pandemic

Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the French and British governments have adopted,
since March 2020 and on several occasions throughout the year, strict provisions for the confinement of the populations
and the restriction of movement of people within and between the two countries. These measures remain in force at the
closing date.

The public health crisis and the successive measures taken by the governments have had a severe impact on traffic and on
the Group’s internal organisation, and more particularly on Eurotunnel’s activities, which have suffered from mid-March to
the end of the year from a very sharp decline in traffic, particularly for Passenger Shuttles and in the number of Eurostar
passengers. The Truck Shuttle business also suffered a significant decline in traffic, although to a lesser extent than other
sectors, due initially to the need to maintain supply flows of essential goods between France and the United Kingdom, and
then over the last quarter of the year due to the effect of stockpiling in the United Kingdom ahead of the end of the Brexit
Transition Period on 31 December 2020.

Europorte’s business was also impacted during the first half of the year, particularly traffic in the automotive sector.

Faced with this situation, the Group implemented a series of measures to allow the movement of goods, while ensuring the
health safety of its customers and staff.

It has also taken decisions to preserve its cash flow by implementing activité partielle in France and a furlough scheme in
the United Kingdom for part of its workforce. The Group has also launched a savings plan aimed at limiting its expenditure
to what is strictly necessary, and at deferring a significant portion of its capital expenditure planned for 2020, while ensuring
that it maintains the expenditure required for safety, continuity of operations and preparation of Brexit. All of these measures
remain in place at the closing date.

Among other measures to preserve its cash position, the Group also announced on 3 April 2020 the cancellation of the
payment of its 2019 dividend. The refinancing of Getlink's Senior Secured Notes concluded in October 2020 (see note A.1
above) also enabled the Group to strengthen its cash position.

Despite this unfavourable environment, the various measures taken by the Group throughout 2020 enabled it to comply at
31 December 2020 with the covenants relating to Eurotunnel's Term Loan and to strengthen its liquidity position. At 31
December 2020, the Group's cash and cash equivalents amounted to €629 million, up €104 million compared to the end of
2019.

Nevertheless, in the context of the health crisis and as a precautionary measure, on 17 October 2020, the Group entered into
agreement with its creditors for a waiver on its main covenant, the “senior debt coverage ratio”, failure to comply with which
would constitute an event of default under the Term Loan. This waiver will apply for the three test dates between December
2020 and December 2021 inclusive, unless the Group decides that such a waiver is not required no later than two months
prior to one of the dates in question. The waiver is subject to certain conditions, including the holding of a minimum cash
balance of approximately €200 million at the Eurotunnel sub-group level at the relevant dates. At 31 December 2020, the
cash held by the Eurotunnel sub-group totalled €330 million.


-----

The consequences for the Group of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 will depend on the evolution of the pandemic over the
coming months and the decisions and actions of the French, European and British authorities, as well as their impact on the
economy in general and on cross-Channel transport in particular.

As part of the preparation of its budget estimates for 2021 and subsequent years, the Group has used the information
available to date and its best assessment of how the situation, particularly in terms of health, could evolve in the short and
medium term. These estimates are obviously subject to uncertainty in the context of high pandemic volatility. On the basis
of these forecasts, the Group will have a sufficient level of liquidity to cover the servicing of its debt in 2021 and 2022 as well
as the financing of its activities.

Getlink SE has taken this context into account in determining the main estimates and assumptions made in preparing its
annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, as set out in note B.1 below.

As indicated in note F below, the conditions attached to the 2025 Green Bonds issued by Getlink SE include financial ratios
(“incurrence covenants”), the non-compliance with which may prevent the completion of certain transactions such as the
payment of dividends or the raising of additional financing, without however giving rise to an event of default. The Group
did not comply with these ratios at 31 December 2020. However, following the refinancing transaction entered into by Getlink
in October 2020 (see notes A.1 above and F below), the conditions associated with the new notes issued increase the Group's
flexibility to raise new financing (up to €400 million) and its ability to pay dividends (€150 million per year up to a limit of
€300 million) without having to comply with these ratios.

###### A.3. Brexit: the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union

Following the decision of the referendum of 23 June 2016 and the triggering of Article 50 by the British government at the
end of March 2017, the official exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union took place on 31 January 2020 with a
Transition Period that ended on 31 December 2020. On 24 December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union
concluded an agreement on their future trade relations. The UK Government indicated that the application of the new border
control arrangements would be phased in during the first half of 2021.

During the year, the Group finalised the implementation of its action and investment plan launched in mid-2018 and
designed to maintain traffic fluidity in the post-Brexit period. These plans and the new procedures for managing vehicle and
goods inspections have been in operation since 1 January 2021.

Getlink SE has taken account of this situation in the determination of the principal estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of its financial statements at 31 December 2020 as set out in note B.1 below.

###### B. Accounting methods and policies

The annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in France. Transactions
recorded in the accounts are valued in accordance with the historical cost convention and the accounts are prepared on the
going concern basis.

###### B.1. Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. The Board periodically reviews its
valuations and estimates based on its experience and various other factors considered relevant for the determination of
reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’ carrying value. Furthermore, the estimates underlying the
preparation of these annual financial statements as at 31 December 2020 have been established in the context of the
uncertainties concerning the Covid-19 pandemic and the final terms and conditions for the implementation of Brexit.
Depending on the evolution of these assumptions, actual results may differ from current estimates.

The use of estimations concerns mainly the valuation of investments in subsidiary undertakings and of associated debts and
loans (see note E below).

###### B.2. Valuation of intangible and tangible assets

Intangible and tangible fixed assets are valued at their acquisition cost. These do not include any share of financial expenses
or overheads.

Fixed assets are amortised according to their economic lives as mentioned below:

Software 1 to 3 years

Machinery and other industrial equipment 5 to 10 years

IT equipment 5 years

Office equipment 5 years

Office furniture 5 to 10 years


-----

###### B.3. Valuation of investments in subsidiary undertakings

Getlink SE assesses the value in use of its investments in subsidiary undertakings on the basis of several criteria, such as the
net book value of the asset, the adjusted book value of the asset, the discounted net financing cash flows, or external
evaluations. A depreciation of intra-group loans where applicable or a provision for impairment may be made when the net
assets of the subsidiary undertaking is negative.

###### B.4. Investments in securities

Investments are stated in the statement of financial position at cost. If the market value is lower than the acquisition cost, a
provision for depreciation is booked for the difference. “Investments in securities” and “Cash and cash equivalents” include
any accrued interest due thereon.

###### B.5. Treasury shares

Getlink SE holds its own shares acquired as part of a share buyback programme and a liquidity contract.

Treasury shares which are reserved explicitly for a share option plan are accounted for as investments in securities at their
purchase price.

In the absence of an explicit allocation to staff or to a share capital reduction, the shares purchased as part of the buyback
programme are accounted for at cost in financial fixed assets.

Shares acquired as part of the liquidity contract, the aim of which is to reduce excessive volatility in Getlink SE’s shares, are
accounted for at cost in investments and the gain or loss on sale of these shares is calculated on a FIFO basis.

At the end of the financial year, these shares are valued on the average share price during the last month. A provision is
made if this valuation is below the book value, except for those shares which are allocated to stock option plans, the free
shares and shares that are to be cancelled.

###### B.6. Share-based payments

As part of the share option plan, Getlink SE makes a provision for risk and charges relating to share option grants as soon
as it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources from the business in the future. When treasury shares are granted
as part of a share option plan, a provision is made for the difference between the exercise price proposed to the beneficiaries
and the net accounting value of the treasury shares granted.

###### B.7. Tax integration convention

Under the terms of the group tax integration convention, tax charges are recognised in the individual financial statements
of consolidated companies, on a stand-alone basis. Any tax savings or losses realised by the Group are recognised
immediately in the parent company’s income statement for the financial year.

###### B.8. Provisions

Provisions are recognised when there exists a legal or constructive obligation stemming from a past event and when the
future cash flows can be reliably estimated.

###### B.9. Conversion of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies

Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for on the basis of the exchange rate on the
date of the transaction, and are then re-valued at the rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

Unrealised exchange differences resulting from this revaluation are recorded in the cumulative translation reserve. A
provision for risks and charges is recognised if the conversion shows unrealised losses.

###### B.10. Debt issuance costs

Debt issuance costs are amortised over the remaining term of the loan at a constant interest rate until maturity of the loan
using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate used to discount all contractual payments due
on the loan until maturity. These flows are calculated on the basis of the forecast flows due for each of the financial
instruments constituting the financial loan. Expenses are presented as deferred charges and are amortised over the life of
the loan.

Other 24 – – **24**

**Total** **24** **700,000** **–** **700,024**

Getlink SE issued €700 million 3.50% Senior Secured Notes (the “2025 Green Bonds”) on 30 October 2020 (the “Offering”).
The 2025 Green Bonds are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange (trading as Euronext Dublin) and are admitted
to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. The 2025 Green Bonds align with the International Capital Markets
Association’s (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018 and Loan Market Association’s (LMA) Green Loan Principles 2020 and
therefore they fall into the category of “green” financing.

The 2025 Green Bonds are governed by an English law trust deed (the “Trust Deed”) between Getlink SE and BNY Mellon
Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee for the holders of the 2025 Green Bonds.

The 2025 Green Bonds are due on 30 October 2025 and interest thereon is payable semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and
30 December of each year, commencing on 30 December 2020.

Pursuant to the Trust Deed, €25,252,500 was paid into a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) corresponding to one year of
interest on the 2025 Green Bonds and a one year commitment fee on the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The fees directly attributable to the transaction amounting to €10.5 million are amortised over the life of the 2025 Green
Bonds.

As at 31 December 2020, the 2025 Green Bonds were rated BB- by S&P and BB+ by Fitch.


-----

**Permitted use of proceeds of the Offering**

In accordance with the offering memorandum relating to the Offering, the Group (i) used a portion of the net proceeds
therefrom to redeem its €550.0 million 3.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 and pay applicable redemption premium and
accrued, but unpaid, interest thereon; and (ii) is allowed to use the remaining portion of such net proceeds to finance capital
expenditure in relation to ElecLink and/or other Eligible Green Assets.

In accordance with its Green Finance Framework, Getlink will prepare and publish a Green Finance Allocation Report within
one year of the issuance of the 2025 Green Bonds and annually thereafter until full allocation of the amount equal to the net
proceeds of the Offering. This report will provide information on the allocation and environmental impact of the 2025 Green
Bonds issued.

**Security and ranking**

The 2025 Green Bonds are subject to an English law intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) between, inter
alios, Getlink SE and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as security agent. The 2025 Green Bonds are secured
by first ranking liens (the “Notes Security”) on (i) all shares in the capital of Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Ltd; and (ii)
a debt service reserve account set up by the Group (the DSRA).

**Redemption**

Optional redemption

The 2025 Green Bonds may be redeemed early under certain conditions and upon the occurrence of certain tax events.

Repurchase upon a change of control

If an event treated as a change of control triggering event occurs, then each holder of the 2025 Green Bonds has the right
to require that Getlink SE repurchase all or part of such holder’s 2025 Green Bonds at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase.

Mandatory redemption

If Getlink SE disposes of its shares in Eurotunnel Holding SAS to a third party in accordance with the requirements of law or
a governmental authority, it shall apply the net cash proceeds of such disposal (i) first, repay the amounts outstanding under
the Term Loan and (ii) second, to redeem all outstanding 2025 Green Bonds at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase.

**Covenants**

The Trust Deed provides for certain incurrence covenants that are customary for this type of financing. These covenants are
only tested upon the occurrence of an event, rather than on an on-going basis. Unless certain conditions are respected,
certain prohibitions apply in relation to the incurrence of additional debt, the making of certain restricted payments,
including dividend payments and the purchase of treasury shares (subject to conditions including if there is an event of
default or if the DSCR is less than 1.25) and other operations including certain sales of assets, the granting of certain liens
and consummation of certain merger and consolidation transactions.

As is customary for financings of this type, there are a number of exceptions to the incurrence covenants that are aimed to
ensure that the Group has sufficient flexibility to operate its business.

**Events of default**

The Trust Deed lists certain events of default, which permit the trustee or a certain percentage of holders to declare the 2025
Green Bonds immediately due and payable.

###### F.2. Deferred charges

The deferred charges include costs directly relating to the issue of the 2025 Green Bonds pending recognition in the income
statement at the same rate as the future remuneration of these notes until maturity on 30 October 2025, over a period of
five years.

**2.3** **OUTLOOK, OBJECTIVES, RECENT EVENTS AND EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD**

Events after the reporting period are described in note K to the consolidated financial statements for the financial year set
out in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Outlook**

As described in the analysis of the consolidated financial results and in notes A.1 and D.9 to the consolidated financial
statements in sections 2.1 and 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document, the periodic traffic restrictions and successive
lockdown measures imposed by the French and British governments between March and December 2020 had a significant
impact on the Group’s traffic and revenues during the 2020 financial year, particularly those of Eurotunnel.

The new lockdown measures introduced in the last quarter of 2020 in the United Kingdom, France and other European
countries, and still in place at the end of the year, were accompanied in the first weeks of 2021 by tighter border restrictions
between the United Kingdom and the Continent. These new restrictions have a direct impact on Eurotunnel’s operations,
particularly Passenger Shuttle traffic and Eurostar services through the Tunnel, which had already been severely affected
throughout 2020. As a result, in January 2021 Passenger Shuttle traffic was 71% lower than in January 2020.

Truck Shuttle traffic, which received a boost in the last quarter of 2020 from stockpiling in anticipation of the end of the
Brexit Transition Period on 31 December 2020, was down 37% in January 2021 compared with the same period in 2020,
impacted both by the effects of post-Brexit destocking and by customers’ need to adjust to the new rules and customs
control procedures in force since 1 January.

The Brexit trade agreement of 24 December 2020 clarified the new framework for trade between the United Kingdom and
the European Union.

The cross-Channel Passenger market is still very much affected by the uncertainties related to the Covid-19 crisis, particularly
with regard to the emergence of new variants, the deployment of the vaccine in the United Kingdom and on the Continent
and the duration and nature of travel restrictions between countries. Nevertheless, the Group remains confident that a strong
rebound in its Passenger Shuttle traffic will materialise as soon as these restrictions are eased, as happened in the summer
of 2020. The Passenger Shuttle service continues to benefit from its position as an extremely safe mode of transport in the
health context, with a car market share in January 2021 of 77.8%, the highest ever.

Eurostar traffic has remained at a very low level in the first weeks of 2021, still penalised by travel restrictions between the
UK and the Continent. The Group is closely monitoring developments in Eurostar’s financial situation, but remains reassured
by the contractual framework of the Railway Usage Contract signed in 1986 with the two States. The launch in October 2020
of the direct service from Amsterdam to London strengthens Eurostar’s offer and, in the medium term, the Group remains
confident that growth in high-speed train traffic between London and the Continent will resume.

In 2021, the Group intends to continue the actions implemented in 2020 to preserve its cash position by controlling its
operating costs, in particular through the dynamic management of its Shuttle capacity and operating plans based on traffic
levels and, as the case may be, by using the short-time working schemes for its staff.

The Group also plans to limit its capital expenditure over 2021 to a level similar to 2020 by deferring certain expenditure on
major renewal programmes, while giving priority to projects related to safety, continuity of service and the completion of
the final adaptations for Brexit. The postponement of this expenditure in the context of the public health crisis does not alter
the Group’s medium-term investment strategy, which is focused on strengthening its quality of service and modernising its
infrastructure and equipment.

Europorte’s business, which was impacted in the first half of 2020 by the effects of the public health crisis, returned to normal
in the second half of the year, and, driven by active management of last-minute ad-hoc services, ended the year with revenue
down by only 2% compared with 2019. The trend for the second half of 2020 is continuing into early 2021, and Europorte
remains well positioned to pursue its strategy of healthy and sustainable growth based on the profitability of its operations
and the quality of its services.

As far as ElecLink is concerned, following the agreement given by the IGC on 10 December 2020, work to install the cable in
the Tunnel began at the end of January and by 24 February 2021, 5 km of cable had been installed. Installation work is
expected to last until the summer of 2021. Once the cable has been installed, an extensive test and commissioning phase
will be required before commercial operation, which is scheduled for mid-2022. As part of the exemption granted in 2014,
ElecLink will submit a request to the national regulators and the European Commission in the first half of 2021 for a definitive
extension of the condition relating to the deadline for bringing the interconnector into service. The Group remains confident
of a favourable outcome to this request.

On 27 February 2020, the Group set a financial target of an EBITDA in 2020 of €580 million at an exchange rate of £1=€1.14
and at constant scope and maintained the objective of exceeding €735 million EBITDA by 2022 (at £1=€1.14) following the
commissioning of the ElecLink electricity interconnector from mid-2021. In a still uncertain economic context following the
United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on 31 January 2020 and the consequences of the Covid-19 crisis, the Group
withdrew these two objectives in 2020.

Nevertheless, despite the unfavourable environment, the various measures taken by the Group throughout 2020 enabled it
to comply at 31 December 2020 with the covenants relating to Eurotunnel’s Term Loan and to strengthen its liquidity
position. At 31 December 2020, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to €629 million, up €104 million compared
to the end of 2019.


-----

Following the completion of the refinancing of Getlink SE’s Green Bonds in October 2020, which raised an additional €126
million of cash, the Group will continue to work on optimising its financing structure to minimise the cost of its debt in line
with market conditions.

Given the strength of its balance sheet and its operational excellence, the Group remains confident in the resilience of its
business model and its ability to return to growth of both revenue and margins when the crisis ends.

**Objectives and 2021 financial outlook**

In the absence of clear visibility on the future decisions by the governments concerning the public health crisis and associated
travel restrictions, the Group is postponing any announcement regarding its 2021 financial performance.

The lack of short-term visibility does not undermine the Group's confidence in the strength of its various activities, their
growth potential in the medium and long term nor its ability to improve its operational and environmental performance.

On the basis of its latest budget estimates, which are based on the information available to date and the Group’s best
assessment of how the situation, particularly health and economic conditions, might evolve in the short and medium term,
the Group considers that it will have a sufficient level of liquidity to service its debt in 2021 and 2022 and finance its
operations.

Confident in its long-term prospects, the Group confirms its commitment to shareholder return and on 25 February 2021
the Group announced that it intends to propose the distribution of a dividend of €0.05 per share to the General Meeting to
be held on 28 April 2021.

**Recent events**

February 2021 Shuttle traffic

In February 2021, Le Shuttle Freight transported 99,787 trucks, a decrease of 24% compared to February 2020, in a market
still marked by the adjustments to new post-Brexit administrative rules but with a trend towards normalisation. The
compulsory requirement to provide a negative Covid-19 PCR test carried out on British soil less than 72 hours previously for
trucks entering France remains the most restrictive constraint for cross-Channel logistics chains.

In February 2021, Le Shuttle transported 31,277 passenger vehicles. The passenger market obviously remains severely
impacted by the travel restrictions put in place by the British and French governments due to the pandemic.

**3.1** **RISK FACTORS**

Like any business, Getlink SE carries out its activities in evolving conditions and is necessarily exposed to risks (industrial,
environmental, human, commercial, financial and others) that, should they materialise, could have a negative effect on its
activities, its financial position and its assets.

Getlink SE identifies these risks using a formalised procedure and seeks to reduce the probability of their occurrence or
potential impact by implementing formalised and specific action plans. The overall system of risk identification and
management put in place is presented in section 3.4 of this Universal Registration Document. The control environment
designed to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to control these risks is described in section 3.4.2 of this Universal
Registration Document.

Getlink SE applies the provisions of the reference framework on internal control and risk management systems published by
the AMF (the French financial markets regulator).

For the 2020 financial year, Getlink SE has carried out the annual review of risks that could have a significant negative impact
on its operations, reputation, financial position or results. This review of risks, presented in a risk map, covered all active
consolidated subsidiaries within the scope of the Group on 31 December 2020.

The most significant specific risks to which the Group considers itself exposed at 24 February 2021, the date on which the
annual accounts were drawn up, are described hereafter.

These risks are presented in three categories:

risks specific to the environment in which Getlink operates;

operating risks relating to the Group’s business; and

regulatory environment and compliance risks.

These risks are ranked according to their net materiality and assessed based on their probability of occurrence and net
impact (financial and reputational), after taking into account any mitigation measures that are in place. In each category, the
most important risk factor is presented first. The subsequent factors are not ranked in order of importance.

The following pictograms have been used to illustrate net materiality:

This list is not exhaustive and there may be other risks of which the Group has no knowledge or that are not considered to
be material or specific at the date of this Universal Registration Document, and that could have an adverse effect.

Risks that could have a CSR impact are identified by the following symbol: 🙒.

Most of the non-financial risks relating to the company's activities are presented in the Non-Financial Performance Statement
in chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document since almost none of these risks meet the materiality criteria set out in
the European Prospectus 3 Regulation.

The main financial risks that do not meet the materiality criteria set out in the European Prospectus 3 Regulation and so are
not presented in this chapter 3 are dealt with in section 2.2.1 in note E.4 (pension funds) and note G.10 (liquidity risk) of this
Universal Registration Document.

**3.1.1** **RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE GROUP’S OPERATING ENVIRONMENT**

|3.1.1 RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE GROUP’S OPERATING ENVIRONMENT|Col2|
|---|---|
|a) Macro-economic and geopolitical conditions||
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description The economic and geopolitical environment affects overall changes in demand for transport. Brexit and travel restrictions relating to Covid-19 could weaken the British and European economies and slow down trade. The Group has a specific exposure to the prevailing economic conditions in France and the United Kingdom since 85% of its revenue depends on economic conditions and on trade between the United Kingdom and continental Europe as well as on geopolitical conditions (including the migrant situation and the political context). Since 2016, these conditions have been affected by the uncertainties relating to Brexit and that could remain the case in 2021 given the potential regulatory changes. As of 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a member state of the European Union and the Transition Period envisaged to negotiate the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement produced a trade and cooperation agreement on 24 December 2020 that defined the new trade relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Although an agreement has been reached, customs formalities and health and phytosanitary controls have been re-established for the transport of goods. These carry the risk of disruption (at least until businesses familiarise themselves with the new rules). Moreover, many aspects of the future relationship have yet to be finalised. A worsening or stagnation in economic conditions (a risk of reduced exports, disruption of supply chains or a decline in GDP) as well as geopolitical risks (such as the political context and the European migratory situation) could have a direct impact on the volume of cross-Channel traffic, both for passengers and freight.|Control and mitigation The risk is primarily external and is related to the macro-economic environment (Brexit and the economic and migrant situations), market conditions and competitors’ pricing strategies. The Group has put a specific process in place to monitor potential macro-economic risks as well as detailed monitoring. This risk is regularly monitored (through specific reviews, sensitivity tests of the business plans and the review of various financial and legal indicators), the results of which are presented to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors. Alongside its stakeholders, Getlink has endeavoured to build appropriate solutions in preparation for Brexit. It has worked with the French and UK customs and border control authorities (investment and contingency plans) and the new procedures have been in place since 1 January 2021. The steps put in place (special offers, #BrexitandBeyond communications, Pit-Stops as well as the Eurotunnel Border Pass), limit the impact of Brexit; however, they cannot completely remove the risk of lost revenue: ▪ Brexit could affect Eurotunnel's competitive position, in particular if it is not able to benefit from the duty-free sales scheme. ▪ The Group actively participates in the development of the activity of the Networks and Railway Companies; this risk is nevertheless mostly external to the Group, which cannot have any meaningful control over the activities of the Railways and Railway Companies. Despite the measures taken to limit this risk, the European and global economic situation makes it impossible to reduce the net materiality of this risk and it remains a major risk for the Group.|


-----

|RISKS AND CONTROLS|Col2|
|---|---|
|i) Contraction of markets and competitor pressure||
|Net materiality||
|Risk identification and description The risk of contraction of the Short Straits truck and passenger market is one of the possible negative consequences of Brexit. Since 2019, the Group has felt the advance impact of the implementation of Brexit, with the truck market being affected by stockpiling followed by stock reduction in the United Kingdom as well as some reluctance among Passenger Shuttle customers to travel. A slowdown or stagnation in economic conditions could have a direct impact on the volume of cross-Channel traffic both for Passenger Shuttle and Truck Shuttle traffic. In respect of its Eurotunnel activities, the Group faces competition from cross-Channel transport operators, whose pricing strategies and other competitive initiatives could have a negative impact on Shuttle Service volumes (particularly on those of the Truck Shuttle Service) and to a lesser extent on passenger numbers in High- Speed Passenger Trains. Market growth and competitive pressure could be impacted by fluctuations in the price of fuel and exchange rates (especially as regards Brexit), which may affect operators’ pricing policies. The Group’s commercial and operating strategy, as well as the as yet uncertain possibility of duty-free sales, as set out in chapter 1 of this Universal Registration Document could be affected by this context. In Europorte’s competitive environment, developments in the market and in rail freight transport traffic and related activities are quite specific: in 2020, competition between operators remained lively and the historic operator still dominated the market in a context of difficult weather conditions. In addition, increasing competition from building and public works sector companies for rail maintenance activities could have an impact on the renewal of certain contracts in the Europorte segment. The level of activity of the Railways, being the Group’s principal customers, could have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position. The Tunnel is used by Railway Companies’ High-Speed Passenger Trains and Rail Freight Services, whose results could be affected by external events and circumstances beyond the control of the Group. The Group does not operate these services and cannot exert direct influence over the commercial operation of Railway Companies’ services.|Control and mitigation The risk is primarily external and related to the macro-economic environment and the pricing strategy of competitors. The Group cannot control the macro-economic environment nor competitor pricing behaviour. The impact of this risk should be less for a business whose business model is based on a premium quality of service for both passenger and freight traffic, however it remains significant. The Group has adapted its commercial strategy to this competitive environment, including reviewing the operations of different sectors. The Group has deployed a number of measures (special offers, engaging in a dialogue with our customers, #BrexitandBeyond communications, diversifying the customer offer including the Passenger Shuttle Flexiplus service). Since 2018, an engineering department has been in place for the Europorte segment. The development of smart engineering and predictive maintenance helps strengthen Europorte’s position in the market in which it operates. The risk linked to the business and development of the Railways and Railway Companies is mainly external to the Group since it does not have actual control over the activities of the Railways nor the Railway Companies. Nevertheless, the Group actively participates in the development of this activity, such as with the pricing framework of the Railways Usage Contract defined in the Network Statement. This aims to offer access conditions that are efficient, stable and encourage Railway Company growth. In particular, the ETICA scheme (Eurotunnel Incentive for Capacity Additions) enables the Group to contribute to the development of new services by the Railway Companies through a non- discriminatory financial aid mechanism during the key start-up and traffic build-up phases. In parallel, the Group conducts regular communication actions and cooperative initiatives with the authorities (government ministries, IGC, the French transport regulatory authority (ART) and ORR) and railway players (Railway Companies, infrastructure managers), to help them understand and progressively reduce the barriers to growth. In this context, the Group works with the authorities and railway players to facilitate the development of new destinations and improve the competitiveness of rail services. The strategies deployed allow the probability of this risk to be reduced; however they do not reduce its impact, which remains hard to control because it is external to the Group and depends on geopolitical conditions.|


-----

|ii) Border controls affecting the handling of traffic flows|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description For the Eurotunnel segment, border controls remain a key matter relating to smooth traffic flows. The post-Brexit agreement entered into on 24 December 2020 allows for quota-free and duty-free access on condition that rules of origin of goods are met. As of 1 January 2021, customs formalities were re-established between the United Kingdom and the European Customs Union. Taking into account the specific characteristics of the cross-Channel border, the re-establishment of the border has been organised according to clear, innovative processes based on a high level of automation: the “smart border”. The planned organisation was operational as of 1 January and made it possible to absorb flows satisfactorily. Nevertheless, the preservation of smooth commercial trade flows depends on the capacity of economic operators (importers, exporters, transporters) to prepare their customs and sanitary formalities before the arrival of goods at the border and on these formalities remaining unchanged and an appropriate level of availability of state agents and the efficiency of customs controls. This risk may accentuate the risk of inadequate management of vehicle flows from their arrival at and their departure from the Fixed Link, particularly on peak days (end of the school holidays). The entire value chain is implicated (passengers and trucks): check-in, tolls, loading and unloading with the multiplicity of controls in place.|Control and mitigation With regard to the movement of goods, Eurotunnel has worked with governments, the European Union, the transport industry and its customers on technological solutions aimed at reducing the impact of customs controls of trucks and trains at the border. The Group has worked in close collaboration with the authorities on the ground to ensure smooth flows at the Eurotunnel terminals by adapting installations to the specific needs of different controls as set out in section 1.6.1.a of this Universal Registration Document. Contingency plans were deployed (customs formalities and sanitary and phytosanitary controls at the SIVEP Customs Centre as well as the Eurotunnel Border Pass). Work is ongoing to optimise the arrangements that were implemented on 1 January 2021 and to continue preparing the necessary modifications for Brexit customs formalities for trucks arriving in the United Kingdom21, while continuing to integrate the additional and evolving constraints linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. With regard to the movement of passengers, the Treaty of Canterbury, presented in chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document, commits the two States to providing smooth traffic flows through the provision of juxtaposed identity controls. Eurostar and Shuttle passengers are controlled by the French Border Police and by the UK Border Force at the departure terminal. Eurostar passengers and Shuttle vehicles are not subject to border controls on arrival at their destination. The investment policy supporting this plan to overhaul the terminals is presented in section 1.6. of this Universal Registration Document. The probability of this risk remains high, but its potential impact has fallen due to the implementation of the measures envisaged. Nevertheless, the Group does not control the risk relating to possible changes in procedures not to the adequacy of the relevant authorities’ resources.|


21 On 11 March 2021, the UK government announced a revised timetable for the introduction of additional controls which delays their
application to 1 October 2021, 1 January 2022 or March 2022 depending on the category.

|RISKS AND CONTROLS|Col2|
|---|---|
|b) Public health crisis||
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description The current Covid-19 pandemic has resulted, in addition to the human aspects, in the closure of certain areas of activity, leading to changes in the levels of production, consumption, transport and normal travel in different regions. National lockdown measures and travel restrictions have led to a significant decline in economic activity for the Group, despite the relative stability of Truck Shuttle activity and the recovery of Europorte’s business in the second half of the year. As at 24 February 2021, the pressure of the pandemic remains high in France and in the United Kingdom. Restrictions at French and European borders are being tightened: restrictions on “non- essential” travel, PCR tests, quarantine, speeding up of vaccinations and vaccination certificates. The emergence of new variants with worldwide spread leading to a greater risk of contagiousness could call into question the effectiveness of vaccines and lead to new restrictions, curfews and even new lockdowns. As much as possible, European leaders are keen to coordinate their responses to the latest developments related to Covid-19 variants. Restrictions change frequently and rapidly. Targeted lockdown measures may continue during 2021. This uncertain environment is likely to continue to affect travel and transport.|Control and mitigation The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the Group's traffic, activities and financial situation throughout 2020. In March, the company activated its Pandemic Crisis Plan and implemented preventive and hygiene measures such as social distancing and barrier measures to protect the health of team members and customers as a priority, while ensuring that business continued in a new and changing context. Work organisation has been re-thought with participation from employees. Awareness- raising operations on barrier measures and the follow-up of contact cases have been and are still being circulated. Eurotunnel and in particular its Shuttle Services were certified by AFNOR (the French standards authority) on 23rd February 2021 following verification of the Covid-19 health measures implemented with the maximum score of 100% as set out in section 6.5.3 of this Universal Registration Document. With the aim of preserving jobs and the company's cash flow, the Group has taken various actions during 2020, including actions to be continued in 2021, which are presented in Chapter 1 of this Universal Registration Document: ▪ the implementation of government schemes to assist employees and employers favouring short-time working in France and the United Kingdom, from the start of the first lockdowns; and ▪ a cost-savings plan aimed at limiting external expenditure and optimising capital expenditure, while ensuring investments in safety and business continuity. The medium-/long-term economic consequences are included in the "Macro-economic and geopolitical conditions" risk above. The Group is paying close attention to the evolution of the pandemic and is constantly monitoring the situation in order to deploy the health instructions and put in place the measures recommended by the States as soon as possible. Since this risk is external, the Group does not control the evolution in the probability of this risk and its impact remains important.|

|c) Impact of national energy policies|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description Energy policy decisions may be taken in France, Great Britain or by the European Union that could change the long-term fundamentals of ElecLink’s interconnector market (for example, the price of carbon emissions, the share of nuclear power in the French energy mix or the overall penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources), which could affect ElecLink's business model. The consequences of Brexit are hard to evaluate in this respect. Change in the post-Brexit regulatory framework, in particular in respect of access rules, could entail additional administrative procedures for ElecLink. ElecLink could be considered to be more exposed than other interconnectors to these risks, since it is an asset that has the benefit of a derogation that is not covered by the tariffs paid by end consumers. Brexit might also have an impact insofar as part of the market mechanism underlying ElecLink's revenues comes from the European Union market mechanism (e.g. market coupling).|Control and mitigation ElecLink has set up continual monitoring of market changes and the regulatory and political situation. Contingency plans are in place to mitigate against the risk of not being able to access capacity auction platforms post Brexit. The Group has arranged new revenue studies and projections for the ElecLink project at the end of 2020 using a new expert. These studies have confirmed the project's estimated revenues. Despite the measures taken, which allow the probability of this risk to be limited, the impact of this risk remains high.|

|d) Threats related to terrorist attacks||
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description Set against the background of an increased threat of terrorism, the Group, as a transport infrastructure, is exposed to the occurrence of malicious acts targeting the organisation, its environment or its image. These may be perpetrated on its installations and in particular its Eurotunnel installations or neighbouring infrastructures required for circulation of the trains or Shuttles. Depending on their seriousness, the occurrence of malicious acts could have an impact on: ▪ the well-being of individuals (customers, team members and partners) and of physical and non-physical assets; ▪ the operations of the business and its stakeholders and/or its image; and ▪ obligations in respect of safety and security: new rules on the part of the French, British, European or other authorities could increase the operational burden or lead to new obligations being imposed. In France, following the attack in Nice on 29 October 2020 the national vigilance, prevention and protection system (Vigipirate) is now at "attack emergency” for the whole of France until further notice. Although safety is a fundamental government function and so is primarily the responsibility of the State services, it concerns the whole of civil society. Everyone contributes to the resilience of the nation through their own actions and level of preparedness for crises and Getlink contributes to the prevention of the occurrence of malicious acts. The Group carries out activities on behalf of the States and must implement security and public health measures along with specific measures for the application of national programmes (such as the French Vigipirate national system). As stipulated in the Concession Agreement, the Group adapts its operating practices to meet these requirements and to deliver the required quality of service. ▪ the operations department adheres to security obligations, under the control of the IGC. It proposes the security policy and the implementation conditions and coordinates their deployment; ▪ a Concession safety plan has been shared with the relevant State services since 1994; ▪ Getlink’s security policy has been updated and will result in updated protection plans for each of the organisation’s core installations. Getlink has crisis management arrangements in place which are managed by its safety department. It regularly carries out crisis management practice exercises covering various topics in order to improve the effectiveness of the arrangements. Nevertheless, this risk is largely of external origin and requires a constant strengthening of the control arrangements, which could require further changes to operational and commercial practices and which may lead to an increase in operating costs or a deterioration in service quality, irrespective of the insurance cover in place (as described in section 3.3 of this Universal Registration Document) or government responsibilities.|Control and mitigation The Group has not had a terrorist incident in 26 years. Training and risk management procedures relating to terrorist incidents have been set up centrally by the Group in coordination with the authorities (such as the armed forces and border police), under the supervision of the French and British governments. This risk is also taken into account in the very design of the Tunnel and the System. The Fixed Link is extremely secure (special prevention plan, recommendations issued by national authorities, on-site military presence and so on). Controls have been strengthened since 2015. Whilst the additional control measures deployed strengthen the protection of facilities and lessen the probability of this risk occurring, the impact of such an attack remains significant.|

|e) Climate change|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description Awareness of climate issues is now leading to profound changes in consumption and mobility. The transition of the economy towards a low-carbon economy could result in a loss of customers, due to changes in behaviour, mobility habits, remote working, carpooling, a reduction in mobility and a change in the engine types of customer vehicles (passenger and freight).|Control and mitigation As set out in Chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document, the Group has worked to define a programme of actions to be implemented that will give new scope to its ambitions in terms of its environmental and societal approach in order to place the fight against climate change at the heart of its environmental policy, in particular by proposing a strong ambition on the reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the Group has increased its understanding of its carbon footprint throughout its value chain in order to define a robust greenhouse gas strategy. The Group has also updated the assessment of the carbon performance of the Group's business activities in comparison with competing modes of transport. In addition, a work programme was launched in 2020 on the acceptability of new engine-types in the Tunnel, including CNG, LNG and hydrogen. Finally, the updating in 2021 of Eurotunnel's previous Climate Change Impact Report will enable the risks and opportunities specific to the Group's infrastructures and businesses (in terms of transition and physical risks) to be assessed, in full compliance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure. This risk is nevertheless an opportunity for the Group given the role of rail transport at national and European level in the ecological transition and the modal shifts that can be anticipated as a result.|

|f) National railway network train path unavailability|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality||
|Risk identification and description Europorte’s operations such as traction are mainly carried out on the national French rail network managed by SNCF Réseau, which is responsible for allocating train paths to railway undertakings. Late modifications by SNCF Réseau and the current organisation of maintenance of the national rail network reduce the availability of train paths. These network traffic issues adversely affect the predictability that railway undertakings, shippers and freight forwarders need for their own logistics chains. These issues may be exacerbated by SNCF staff labour action (strike action). This lack of predictability is a source of increased costs in terms of downtime as well as affecting the attractiveness of rail transport which in turn represents a curb on growth. Furthermore, the critical nature of this risk may be exacerbated by weather-related risks as described in section 3.1.1.h below.|Control and mitigation In order to reduce this risk, Europorte has deployed the necessary steps to optimise existing tools and has set up a specialist unit trained to optimise train path reservation. A programme has been set up to train employees in the use of SNCF Réseau tools. Europorte does not control this external risk. Taking into account the social context and customer orders that are increasingly arriving later, the probability of this risk is increasing and this risk remains significant.|

|RISKS AND CONTROLS|Col2|
|---|---|
|g) Exchange rate variations||
|Net materiality||
|Risk identification and description The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in euros. Fluctuations in the sterling/euro exchange rate have an impact on the value in euros of revenue, costs, financial income and expenses, as well as of the assets and liabilities as reported by the Group. Although the Group is only exposed to a single exchange rate, the volatility of sterling, particularly in the context of Brexit, has an impact on revenue combined in euros. A little less than half of the Group’s revenue is generated in sterling, whilst a larger proportion of expenditure (operating and capital expenditure) is denominated in euros. Eurotunnel’s Term Loan is denominated in sterling for a nominal amount of £1.704 billion and in euros for a nominal amount of €2.031 billion at 31 December 2020. The Group’s various business activities result in receivables and payables between the different Group companies, sometimes in different currencies, particularly between Getlink SE and its subsidiaries. The Group arranges funding for its various business activities. These intra-Group financing arrangements may generate currency imbalances which, taking account of exchange rate risk and depending on the direction of the funding flows, may automatically translate into losses in the consolidated financial statements.|Control and mitigation The Group is working on improving the match between the currencies in which its revenue and costs are denominated. The Group also uses exchange operations to ensure optimum management of this risk. However, there is no guarantee that these measures will significantly reduce the risk borne by the Group in the event of a fall in the rate of sterling against the euro nor that they will ensure that the materialisation of this risk would not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position and/or its ability to service its debt. In addition to the measures described above, the Group’s finance department continually monitors movements in the sterling/euro exchange rate, while its treasury risk management committee receives formal monthly detailed reports of forecast and actual exchange rate fluctuations. The work of the treasury risk management committee is reported to Getlink SE’s Audit Committee. The measures are set out in note G.10 in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document. Risk management is optimised but an extrinsic part of this risk remains potentially sensitive, given its impact.|

|h) Physical climate risks|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description Severe weather events such as heatwaves, floods, storms and/or natural disasters could affect the ability of the organisation (both Eurotunnel’s infrastructure and Europorte, which operates in an open environment on the national rail network) to carry out its operations in a normal way or to deliver the expected service. Thus, looking forward to 2100, the consequences of global warming could increase the intensity and occurrence of these phenomena. Moreover, these phenomena could also modify the quantity and origin of agricultural raw materials transported by Europorte.|Control and mitigation Within the framework of the Natural Risk Prevention Plans (NRPP) and more particularly the local RPP, French government services regularly carry out studies that simulate climate events such as storms, once-in-a-century rainfall and rising water levels using a rigorous hydrodynamic model that takes into account structures built since the middle ages to drain (by means of ditches) and protect (by means of dykes) the coastline of Flanders, which begins at Sangatte. The update in 2021 of Eurotunnel's previous Climate Change Impact Report will provide a more detailed understanding of the climate risks and opportunities specific to the Group's infrastructures and businesses (in terms of climate change and physical risks), in order to determine appropriate action plans to ensure the resilience of its infrastructures and services, in full compliance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure. Europorte attends meetings on crisis management plans with SNCF Réseau and adapts its transport plans to a degraded mode for a service resumption under the best possible operating conditions.|

|i) Cyber attacks|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description Businesses are increasingly exposed to risks linked to cyber attacks such as physical risks (such as hardware outages, theft and sabotage), human risks (such as human error) and software risks (such as software malfunctions). Cyber security is an essential element that must go hand in hand with digitalisation. This challenge has been identified as an absolute priority at the highest level in the Group, particularly with regard to projects linked to Brexit and ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System which permits the tracking of visitors from countries that do not need a visa to enter the Schengen area) and is taken into account from the outset in the system design. Getlink has in place mechanisms to prevent, detect and repair a cyber attack. Nevertheless, given the complexity of information systems and their interconnectivity, cyber risks are considered as risks likely to have a significant impact. Malicious computer software attacks, data hijacking (ransomware attacks), personal data theft and internal malicious acts are additional factors that justify this risk level. The collection of personal data in projects as part of Brexit-related developments such as smart borders or ETIAS, are factors that exacerbate the impact of the risk. The wider implementation of remote working to prevent health risks linked to the Covid-19 pandemic could increase the risk due to the development of remote access.|Control and mitigation With regard to information systems, risks related to the integrity of data and systems are covered by procedures and controls that are integrated into the systems themselves. The Group has an IT tool user guide that enables all team members to share best practice and levels of control appropriate to the risks incurred. This policy is accompanied by an information systems safety audit programme carried out by an external firm. Cyber security is provided in four areas: ▪ Governance to analyse risks, define policies and ensure the operational management of cyber security in a transversal way, while making all entities and players accountable. This governance is ensured by two committees, the Board of Directors’ Safety and Security Committee and the cyber security steering committee, made up of Group operating officers and cyber security specialists. ▪ Rigorous system protection, regularly tested by audits and tests carried out by service providers qualified by the authorities, in particular the French National Agency for Information Systems Security (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information, “ANSSI”). ▪ Real-time, round-the-clock attack detection systems, also certified by ANSSI, and linked to an alert system. ▪ Action plans in case of an attack, which involve both IT specialists and business users. Reaction processes allow known attacks to be blocked quickly. Agile Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) in place provide a “digital fallback” platform which is independent of the IT system, which contains the essential information enabling the business to continue its activity in the event of a system blackout. This platform also contains a communication system to replace the messaging system if necessary. These challenges remain a priority in 2021 and for the following years, particularly since 2017 the Group has put an ambitious digital plan in place to enrich and improve the services offered to its customers and optimise the efficiency of internal processes. Collaborative working systems, mobile applications and Big Data and Cloud solutions are being rapidly developed. In 2020, the Group’s subscription to cyber insurance with a total cyber risk coverage of €10 million has helped reduce the assessment of the impact of the risk but not its probability.|

**3.1.2** **OPERATIONAL RISKS RELATED TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESS**

|3.1.2 OPERATIONAL RISKS RELATED TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESS|Col2|
|---|---|
|a) Delay of a strategic project||
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description This risk mainly concerns the ElecLink project relating to the electricity interconnector through the Tunnel connecting the electricity transmission networks in France and Great Britain. As ElecLink’s sole shareholder, the Group is exposed to the risks relating to the project. The two main risk factors are as follows: ▪ A delay in completing the project due to specific requests from or a delay on the part the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, which could have an impact on the commissioning date, future revenue and the expected return on investment; ▪ Less favourable market conditions than expected when the final investment decision was made. The absence of visibility post-Brexit regarding the market mechanisms for British interconnectors, which may face technical restrictions in accessing European market coupling platforms, could lead to a less efficient allocation of cross-border capacity between the connected markets. In October 2020, the Group obtained authorisation to carry out tests to connect the converter stations to the national high-voltage networks and on 10 December 2020 the IGC gave its approval to proceed with the pulling of the cable through the Tunnel. As of the date of this Universal Registration Document, this work is in progress and is expected to continue in 2021. After an in-depth test phase, commercial operation should begin in mid-2022. Despite the agreement of the IGC to install the cable in the Tunnel, there is still a risk of delay in the completion of the project due to specific requests made by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority when the commissioning tests are carried out in the Tunnel, which would have an impact on the date of entry into operation, future revenues and the expected return on investment. The risk of operational disruption to Tunnel activities is monitored proactively and effectively mitigated. In the medium term, the risk also relates to major investment projects launched by Eurotunnel as set out in section 1.6 of this Universal Registration Document as well as strategic issues such as the transport of electric and autonomous vehicles.|Control and mitigation The Group has strengthened the operational monitoring and supervision of this project. In response to additional requests from the IGC, the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, the Group has conducted a large number of studies and requested additional reports by experts. In parallel, construction work on the converter stations, the installation of the external cables outside the Tunnel and the installation of supports in the Tunnel continued according to the original schedule. The Group has nevertheless demonstrated its ability to finance the project. The Group carried out a value-in-use test on ElecLink at 31 December 2020. This test confirmed that the value in use of all ElecLink's assets is higher than its carrying amount at 31 December 2020. In carrying out the valuation tests, the Group used the best estimates available to it at the balance sheet date. The value-in-use test includes in particular the contractual conditions of the derogation to date. However, given the ongoing construction of the ElecLink project and the current context, particularly in relation to Brexit, the assumptions on which these estimates are based are, by their nature, still uncertain and actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, the Group has been particularly vigilant in setting up appropriate insurance coverage for ElecLink to cover possible damage to the Tunnel. The main risk remains the delay in the commissioning of the project due to delays on the part of the regulator. The Group considers that the impact and probability of this risk remain significant.|


-----

|b) Ability to manage innovative projects|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description The ability to manage innovative technical projects and incorporate new changes creates uncertainties that may impact operations. The implementation of numerous new projects requires the development of innovative solutions. During replacement and investment campaigns, risks need to be anticipated and all departments must work together. The Group may run into problems related to project management, from design to industrialisation. These could damage the Group's image and reputation for its ability to deliver innovative solutions. Against the background of its service quality and digital transformation strategy, the Group is planning major investments in the next few years, especially in the renovation of its infrastructure and rolling stock as described in section 1.6.1 of this Universal Registration Document. Investments have to be planned several years before they are put into service. The length of the investment cycle carries risks for the expected return on past investments. The uncertainties linked to this type of long-term investment could cause significant budget overruns. This risk is considered major due to its potential financial impact, given the level of investments planned, even though the necessary means to limit the probability of its occurrence have been developed. The Group will have to deal with numerous renovation campaigns involving improvements/innovations that are a source of uncertainty. Further technical requirements imposed by regulators, which generate additional costs, which could make the delivery or implementation of projects more complex.|Control and mitigation The Group has created a new projects and engineering department in order to identify, prioritise and coordinate projects better. Forward planning and collaboration have been strengthened. The digital transformation strategic project is part of the continuous improvement of the quality of service. The industrial reorganisation and the use of external engineering reinforce the control of this risk. This risk is of medium impact and probability.|

|c) Infrastructure and/or rolling stock failure||
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description Infrastructure and rolling stock have been in operation for 26 years. They are monitored via the large-scale maintenance plans with replacements needed on occasion. The first-generation Truck Shuttles and certain key systems for the Passenger Shuttles will need replacing (halon, cooling fluids). Maintenance requirements may increase. The rolling stock and some of the Eurotunnel installations have been supplied in very small volumes by a very limited number of suppliers to meet highly specific operating requirements. The Group believes that if its original suppliers were unable to supply replacement parts or whole Shuttles for any reason, or were unwilling to do so on acceptable terms, it would be able to obtain suitable materials and equipment from other manufacturers. However, the price or timeframe for such replacements could have an adverse impact on the Group’s financial position and outlook. The postponement of certain investments following the pandemic (cost rationalisation via the Shield plan) could increase the risk. As regards ElecLink, it cannot be excluded that the installation work in the rail tunnel of high-voltage cables may affect traffic planning in the Tunnel.|Control and mitigation The Group has more than 26 years’ experience in maintaining its rolling stock, equipment and infrastructure. It has a standard maintenance programme, a long-term, large-scale maintenance programme, as well as a rolling stock and equipment replacement plan as indicated in section 1.2.4 of this Universal Registration Document. However, given the specific nature of the Fixed Link’s rolling stock, equipment and infrastructure, the particular conditions of use in a saline environment (cause of corrosion), and the intensity of their use as well as technological advances, these programmes and plans may prove insufficient or unsuitable, particularly in the event of premature obsolescence or an increase in technical faults. This could lead to unforeseen costs or to partial or temporary interruptions of service that could affect the Group’s activity, financial position or results. The Group attaches importance to the reinforcement of appropriate behaviour and implements a set of appropriate procedures to ensure efficient use of the infrastructure and equipment. The Group has implemented standardisation and renovation programmes designed to reduce future maintenance needs and improve the availability of its rolling stock. The impact of the new industrial solutions introduced to improve operating performance may be hard to master and could lead to temporary disruptions to services. The equipment and materials risk is managed through the purchase of reserve stocks, reviews of the panel of suppliers, and research into alternative equipment and technologies. In order to reduce the potential impact of these risks, mitigation measures and a risk control and management system have been put in place. Through its safety policies, each Group subsidiary participates continuously and actively in the proper functioning and improvement of this system. The actions implemented by the various entities in response to these risks help to maintain equipment and infrastructures at a high level of reliability and performance. The Fixed Link has, for example, taken various actions, including the following: ▪ establishing stocks of spare parts; ▪ quality control; ▪ replacement of rails and blocks when necessary; ▪ maintenance plans; ▪ implementation of preventive measures by monitoring near misses; ▪ monthly safety reports, presented to the Safety Committee and to the IGC. Regarding ElecLink, a number of control mechanisms have been put in place to avoid disruption to Tunnel maintenance during the construction phase. The financial health of suppliers is verified by the procurement department, which can request the assistance of the finance department to validate commitments with the companies concerned. The way in which Eurotunnel is organised, with the creation of a dedicated projects and engineering department, aims to strengthen the leadership of maintenance production and future investment projects. The improvements following the purchase of new Truck Shuttles in 2017, the mid-life programme launched in 2018 and other renovation projects in progress will help to reduce the probability of this risk. The arrangements in place have improved the management of maintenance production and major investment projects. In the meantime, the risk of failure remains high, with impacts on revenue in the event of occurrence. The postponement of certain investments in the light of the pandemic means that it is not possible to lower the probability of this risk in the short term.|

|d) Major Tunnel fire|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description A major fire in the Tunnel is a significant specific risk. A fire in an industrial or commercial establishment has direct and indirect impacts on people, companies and the environment. If it occurred, it might heavily impact on Eurotunnel activity. Tunnel traffic could be reduced or even halted for an indefinite period. Damages could be sought. With regard to past incidents, the occurrence of another major fire could also result in a substantial increase in insurance premiums.|Control and mitigation Safety-related and fire risks in the Tunnel are covered by the design of the System itself and by a series of principles, procedures and controls that have been validated by the IGC and that provide effective detection in order to enable timely intervention to evacuate people and facilitate the intervention of the emergency services. All Shuttles are equipped with fire detection devices, extinguishing equipment and fire doors. A ventilation system renews the air in the service tunnel at a higher pressure than in railway tunnels. Eurotunnel has put pre-boarding security measures and controls in place including moving the tarpaulin controls, antenna detectors on the Truck Shuttles and replacing pagodas, which are additional measures to lessen the risk along with prevention campaigns for truck drivers. The Group monitors innovations in fire detection and prevention systems. The Group also takes into account the fact that these risks may come from external entities using the Group's facilities. The increasing number of electric vehicles being transported could increase the risk and the arrival of new propulsion technology (liquid petroleum gas, hydrogen etc) is being analysed. The Tunnel has specialist rescue mission teams who patrol the service tunnel 24 hours a day. SAFE stations and other fire detection and fighting systems, such as the Salamandre plan, help to reduce the probability of this risk occurring and its impact. Nevertheless, whilst this risk may be diminished with all the measures in place, the potential impact remains significant.|

|e) Collision / derailment / railway accident on the national railway network|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality 🙒||
|Risk identification and description Rail traffic entails risks for the environment (transport of dangerous goods), third parties (when conurbations are crossed, level crossings and so on), customers and staff. The Tunnel infrastructure, due to its restricted environment, is less exposed to rail risks than the national rail network. Europorte, a rail freight company operating on the national rail network, has recorded two derailments in the last two years without any major bodily injury or material damage. Rolling stock failure or human error can be the cause of railway accidents.|Control and mitigation Rail transport is a regulated activity. Regulation covers all the human and technical aspects and its aim is to avoid railway accidents and reduce their consequences. To be able to operate on the French rail network, rail freight (and passenger) undertakings such as Europorte must have: ▪ a European rail freight company licence issued by their country of establishment (by the Ministry of Transport for French companies) or by another Member State of the European Union. This licence certifies that the undertaking meets a minimum requirement in terms of good reputation, financial standing and professional competence, as well as civil liability cover; ▪ and a safety certificate for the lines on which the operator wishes to operate issued by the National Safety Authority (ANS): the Établissement Public de Sécurité Ferroviaire (EPSF) in France. Drivers are trained in safety instructions. Additional controls and safety inspections are in place. However, the obsolescence of equipment and the transport and handling of dangerous goods can exacerbate this risk. The probability of this risk remains moderate but its impact could be very high.|

|f) Cash flow / covenants risk||
|Net materiality||
|Risk identification and description The Group is required to comply with the Term Loan covenants relating to Eurotunnel as well as those relating to the Green Bonds. Failure to comply with some of the covenants relating to the debt could, as the case may be, constitute an event of default or restrict the terms and conditions for the use of available cash as set out in note G.1 to the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2020 as set out in section 2.2.1 as well as sections 8.2.4 and 8.2.5 of this Universal Registration Document.|Control and mitigation The Group monitored this risk throughout the year and regularly communicated to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors in respect of the various actions envisaged. An increased focus on cash flow forecasts and compliance with covenants was put in place in the second half of 2020 and it will continue in 2021. In the context of the public health crisis and out of precaution, the Group has entered into a waiver agreement with its creditors until the end of 2021 in respect of its main covenant. The Group has also placed €35 million into a Capex reserve account, as set out in section 1.1.2.a of this Universal Registration Document, which is intended to finance the capital expenditure required to maintain and operate the Fixed Link infrastructure. As part of the refinancing of the Greens Bonds, the Group raised an additional €126 million in cash and set up a €75 million revolving credit facility (so far unused). Cost savings plans, the postponement of certain investments to reduce cash outflows, the cancellation of the 2019 dividend, the good performance of cash receipts, particularly those of the Truck Shuttles, and the intentionally prudent management of inter- company flows have all enabled the Group to manage the risk.|

|Risk identification and description The Group carries out its activities in a highly regulated environment, as set out in chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document, which results in a high degree of dependency on decisions and measures over which the Group has very little or no influence. Although regulatory changes may bring new market opportunities for the Group's activities, they also generate risks. Like any business operating in the United Kingdom, the Group faces legal and regulatory uncertainty with the risks of divergent positions between the French and British regulators in different areas, and more particularly a risk of coordination between the two national control bodies (the French Transport Regulatory Authority (ART, formerly ARAFER) and the UK Office of Rail & Road (ORR)). Given the binational nature of the company, its activities and a fortiori in the post-Brexit regulatory context (GDPR, competition, anti-corruption and so on), Getlink could also face legal and regulatory uncertainty, due in particular to the divergent positions of the authorities. Future changes in regulations, their interpretation or their application by the regulators, the authorities or the courts may lead to additional costs for the Group and affect its activity, its reputation, financial position and/or its results. The relevant authorities could also adopt other stricter rules or rules in new areas that are not currently considered, with similar effect. The Group is aware of the strong legal and regulatory framework in which it operates and seeks as far as possible to conduct communication actions and implement communication and awareness-raising to safeguard the Group’s interests.|Control and mitigation A dedicated department, the public affairs department, oversees compliance with the rights and duties arising from the Concession by both the ceding States and the Concessionaires, and liaises between and closely monitors relationships with the IGC, ART and ORR, which are responsible for economic regulation of the Fixed Link, as well as the national and European lawmakers. The Concessionaires and the regulatory authorities work together in a collaborative approach and have established a work programme spanning several years in order to optimise dialogue. ART and ORR have concluded an agreement to ensure cooperation based on reciprocity, transparency, compromise and trust. The management of these risks is closely monitored by certain departments, including the legal department, through a monitoring procedure and follow-up meetings with the relevant operational departments. As a preventive measure, the legal department is responsible for organising awareness-raising activities and preventive measures. The Group has developed a compliance strategy under the direction of the Secretary to the Board of Directors, who assumes the role of Compliance Officer for the Group. The risk is mainly external. It is difficult to control changes in legislation and their interpretation by the regulatory authorities, so control remains weak. Eurotunnel's ability to control this risk consists of carrying out awareness-raising activities with the possibility of recourse to the courts as a last resort.|

|b) Changes in tax regulations|Col2|
|---|---|
|Net materiality||
|Risk identification and description Changes in the tax regime could result in an increase in taxes. Until recently, the impact of this risk was minimal since the Group was fiscally loss-making. Now that the Group is making a fiscal profit, the impact has become greater even though the Group has significant tax loss carry forwards in the United Kingdom and France. The risk is that these carried forward losses could no longer be used. The mechanisms for the five-yearly reassessment of business rates in the United Kingdom are a source of uncertainty. For example, the last reassessment of UK Business rates in April 2017 resulted in a significant increase. Current changes, particularly the BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) measures, could impact the Group, and French-British taxation could also be impacted by the consequences of Brexit.|Control and mitigation The Group is keen to comply with local tax laws and regulations so it relies on a network of tax professionals to ensure compliance with its obligations in this area and thus limit tax risk to a reasonable and customary level. A tax model has been set up incorporating the impact of medium- and long-term changes. The publication of the tax strategy and the implementation of a risk mapping and various means of control covering tax evasion are control measures that help control internal risk control; however the residual risk is mainly external. This risk remains moderate in view of the resources in place.|

**3.2** **LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**

In the course of its business, the Group and its subsidiaries can be involved, like any organisation, in various administrative,
legal or arbitration procedures, the most significant of which are discussed in more detail below.

More generally, it cannot be ruled out that in future new legal proceedings, whether related to ongoing proceedings or not,
could be brought against any of the Group’s entities or their legal representatives. Were such proceedings to have an
unfavourable outcome, they could have an adverse impact on the business, financial position or results of the Group, its
image or that of its corporate officers.

The legal, human resources and finance departments work to resolve ongoing and potential disputes as well as improving
procedures and training aimed at minimising the risk of litigation.

**3.2.1** **SIGNIFICANT PROCEEDINGS**

**a)** **Litigation relating to the cessation of the maritime activity**

The cessation of the maritime activity on 1 July 2015 led to several proceedings, including by the liquidator of SCOP
SeaFrance and the AGS (the French insolvency fund for the management of employee claims) as well as the legal challenge
by DFDS as to the exercise price of the put options for the two ferries.

Regarding the sale of the ships, DFDS brought a claim in arbitration for restitution of part of the purchase price. The Paris
Maritime Arbitration Chamber rejected all DFDS's claims for principal and interest by an award dated 26 February 2019. DFDS
requested a second instance review and the hearing was held in November 2019 before a new panel of arbitrators. The initial
award was confirmed by the Paris Maritime Arbitration Chamber on 30 April 2020.

The claims that the liquidator of SCOP SeaFrance and AGS (the wage guarantee insurance association) were able to initiate
were the subject of a transaction resulting in the approval and recognition of the withdrawal of proceedings and actions by
AGS by the Commercial Court on 28 February 2020 and 9 June 2020 respectively and the claims are now closed.

The Société d’Exploitation des Ports du Détroit (SEPD, the company operating the ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer)
succeeded in a claim before the Commercial Court of Lille to obtain payment of port fees in relation to the mooring of the
Rodin and Berlioz ships during the summer of 2015. The Group is appealing the Court’s judgment on the grounds that the
operator alone, namely SCOP SeaFrance, is responsible for such fees. The case was heard at the Douai Court of Appeal at
the end of January 2021 and the judgment is expected from the second half of March 2021.

**b)** **Litigation relating to Eurotunnel activity**

The expert measures expedited at the Concession site following the 2008 fire have ended. The Court experts have filed their
report at the Commercial Court. The carriers’ claims, which have been frozen since 2008, will now be considered by the
competent court. The Group’s insurance policies cover such claims and the Group’s interests will be defended by its thirdparty liability insurer.

In 2016, France Manche SA was indicted following a workplace accident in 2011 during work in the Tunnel involving a subcontractor. The criminal investigation is still in progress and may last several years.

In 2017, a sub-contractor’s temporary worker had a work accident on the Concession site. The public prosecutor's office
referred Getlink to the Criminal Court of Boulogne-sur-Mer, which finally dismissed the case against Getlink and
France Manche.

No natural persons from the Group, managers or otherwise, have been indicted. The safety of employees and sub-contractors
remains the Group’s priority as set out in chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document.

**c)** **Litigation relating to Europorte activity**

Following a tendering process launched by the Grand Port Maritime de Bordeaux (GPMB) to operate the Verdon port
terminal, Europorte entered into a terminal operator agreement with GMPB and a contract for port handling services with
Société de Manutention Portuaire Aquitaine (SMPA) in 2015.

In 2016, following discussions between the various stakeholders aimed at establishing the necessary conditions to start
operating the terminal, in what was a difficult social and competitive environment, Europorte terminated the above contracts
in application of the relevant contractual provisions. GPMB nonetheless decided to substitute the initial contractor for SMPA,
at Europorte’s risk and expense. This decision was initially overturned by the Administrative Court of Bordeaux but later
upheld by a Council of State order dated 14 February 2017. Several actions are ongoing before the Bordeaux Court, firstly
to cancel this decision (claim for damages lodged by Europorte on 10 August 2018) and secondly to contest the late payment
penalties and occupation fees invoiced to Europorte by GPMB (appeal of the judgement of the Administrative Court of
Bordeaux of 2 July 2018 having partially allowed the enforcement orders in question). This dispute was the subject of a
settlement agreement between GPMB and Europorte.

SMPA has been unable to operate the Verdon port terminal and its appointment ended on 21 March 2018 pursuant to the
provisions of the port terminal agreement. The tendering process to award a new port terminal agreement launched by
GPMB on 7 July 2017 has been declared unsuccessful.


-----

By order dated 28 June 2017, receivership proceedings were launched before the Commercial Court of Bordeaux in respect
of SMPA. On 23 December 2017, SMPA brought an action against Europorte before the Commercial Court of Bordeaux to
obtain compensation for alleged damages. Those proceedings were converted into judicial liquidation proceedings by
judgment of 29 May 2019. The Liquidating Agent having taken over the proceedings on its own account, the case was heard
on 5 January 2021 and an outcome is expected on 23 March 2021.

At the same time, Sea Invest Bordeaux, having been excluded during the call for tenders, initiated proceedings to cancel the
port terminal agreement concluded between GPMB and Europorte. In a judgement handed down on 22 February 2021 by
the Bordeaux Administrative Court of Appeal, the Court annulled the terminal agreement of 19 December 2014 by which
the Grand Port Maritime de Bordeaux had entrusted the operation of the Verdon South-West container terminal to
Europorte.

**3.2.2** **IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROFITABILITY OF THE GROUP**

As far as it is aware, and subject to the paragraphs above, the Group and its subsidiaries have not during the last 12 months
been involved in any judicial or governmental proceedings or arbitration that is ongoing or suspended, which could have or
has had a significant negative effect on its financial position or profitability.

As at 31 December 2020, the amount of provisions for the significant litigation or procedural risks in which the Group is
involved amounts to €3 million.

**3.3** **INSURANCE AND RISK COVERAGE**

Getlink SE’s insurance programmes consist primarily of policies covering material damage and business interruption
(including terrorism) and third-party liability.

Regarding the Fixed Link, the insurance policy for damage to property and operating losses (including terrorism) covers up
to a total limit of €700 million in a single layer. The policy was renegotiated and renewed on 1 January 2021 for a period of
one year, ending on 31 December 2021.

The third-party liability policy taken out by the Group (except specific programmes) was also renegotiated and renewed on
1 January 2021 for a period of one year, ending on 31 December 2021.

The specific insurance programme for EPF, EPP and Socorail which was already in place, has been renewed for the period
1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021. It includes cover for material damage and business interruption, third-party liability
and environmental damage.

In certain circumstances, payments by insurance companies under existing insurance guarantees may not be sufficient to
cover all of the loss suffered. Losses in excess of the agreed indemnity limits or the application of deductibles or certain
exclusion clauses could result in the Group incurring unforeseen costs, affect its business, financial position or results.

In addition, changes to the insurance market and the occurrence of operational incidents could lead to an adverse change
in the Group’s insurance programme and the terms and conditions of such insurance, such as the level of premiums, the
level of insurance deductibles and the scope of any exclusions which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial position or results.

In 2020, the Group took out cyber insurance for a total cyber risk coverage of €10 million.

As part of these risk management procedures, the Group constantly monitors the adequacy of coverage and actions to be
undertaken. In 2020, the insurance coverage was sufficient for the needs of the Group.


-----

**3.4** **INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS**

The control environment, which is essential to the internal control system, to good risk management and to the application
of procedures, relies on behaviour, organisation and team members. It is part of a culture of commitment and rigour
communicated by the Group. Individual and collective commitment is essential to the adoption of behaviour founded on
integrity and transparency, in order to act ethically and contribute to the long-term success of the Group.

Each year the Group develops and strengthens its compliance culture, basing it on a new Ethics Charter that is the bedrock
on which the set of internal policies, code of conduct and procedures adopted by Getlink are based. A strong “zero tolerance”
message, in particular in the fight against corruption, is promoted by the Chairman and general management.

This section presents the internal control and risk management measures taken by the Group, including management of
ethics and compliance risk.

**3.4.1** **DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT**

**a)** **Legal and reference framework**

Pursuant to article L. 225-100-1 of the French Commercial Code, the Getlink SE Board of Directors presents in its
management report the main aspects of the internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the company
for the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.

This report was drafted in keeping with the Reference Framework recommended by the AMF (French financial markets
regulator) dated 22 July 2010.

The report was examined by the Audit Committee and then reviewed and finalised by the Board of Getlink SE on
24 February 2021.

**b)** **Definition, objectives and scope of internal control and risk management**

Management of risks is a dynamic process at Getlink, consisting of a combination of means, processes, behaviour, procedures
and actions adapted to the specific features of each company. It contributes to the effective management of the company’s
business, the efficiency of its operations and the efficient use of its resources and should enable it to appropriately factor in
all significant risks, be they operational, financial or compliance. The process goes beyond the strictly financial sphere and
encompasses the various types of risk including operational risk.

Specifically, the process seeks to ensure:

compliance with the laws and regulations in force;

the application of instructions set by general management;

the proper functioning of the internal processes, particularly those related to safeguarding its tangible and intangible
assets; and

the reliability of financial information.

Internal control is not restricted to a set of procedures nor mere accounting and financial processes and it does not
encompass all the initiatives undertaken by corporate or management bodies.

Getlink’s corporate governance system rests on three lines of control in accordance with the IFACI (French institute of internal
audit and control) recommendations, which define the roles and responsibilities of operational management, crossdisciplinary functions and internal audit.

The internal control and risk management system extends to all Group entities included in the scope of consolidation.

**3.4.2** **COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS**

**a)** **Risk management procedures**

The objective of the Group’s risk management process is to enable general management and the Board to:

have an overall, consistent and structured view of all types of major risks to which the business is exposed and changes
therein; and

assess the appropriateness of the mitigating measures implemented by those responsible for managing each of the risks
in the light of their potential impact on the strategic objectives.

Risk management contributes to creating and preserving the Group’s value, assets and reputation.


-----

**i)** **Identification and analysis of risks**

This first stage allows the key risks that threaten the achievement of the objectives to be identified and consolidated. This
identification is followed by an analysis which involves examining the potential consequences of the key risks whether
financial, human, legal or related to reputation and estimating the likelihood that they may occur.

**ii)** **Risk management**

The risk management system is monitored and regularly reviewed with a view to its ongoing improvement. The aim is to
identify and assess key potential risks and draw lessons from incidents.

The process includes a formal annual review presented to the Audit Committee and, subsequently, to the Board of Getlink SE,
at the end of the financial year under consideration. In conjunction with the Safety and Security Committee, the Audit
Committee and the Board of Directors oversee the annual review of strategic financial, operational and non-financial risks,
as well as their ranking and presentation in the Universal Registration Document. The risk reviews are based on the strategic
plan applicable at the date of the relevant review.

Risk reviews are coordinated by the person in charge of risk management in the organisation. These reviews help to assess
the risks facing the business and to identify and assess the mitigating measures put in place to manage them. They enable
a risk mapping.

The process, which consists primarily of formal interviews with directors and senior management across the business,
comprises two parallel approaches:

a top-down approach, consisting of the identification of the risks linked to strategic initiatives (both from the point of
view of their direct effect on the business and the knock-on effect that they may generate on pre-existing risks) and
changes in the business’s economic environment; and

a traditional bottom-up approach which seeks to identify risks in each of the main business areas (commercial,
technical/operational, financial, staff, safety and security, environment and corporate governance).

The Group approached the risk review in a context of high economic uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Against
that background, the Group finance department, with the main business units and senior management, focused on major
risks and risks likely to become major. The Group has also committed itself to strengthen the management of these risks.
The risk review is implemented by general management and applied by departments of the various entities and functional
departments, through an appropriate operational risk management system in matters of:

governance (bodies and decision mechanisms, supervision and monitoring);

supervision (identifying key risks to watch, risk management policies comprising limits); and

monitoring (budget monitoring, reporting).

**iii)** **Treatment and monitoring of risks**

With regard to risk management, the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring the existence and
effectiveness of risk management systems. In this context, the Audit Committee is required to review the entire system put
in place by general management. The risk management system is the result of interaction between the risk committee and
the other players, i.e. internal audit, the insurance department and the functional departments, as well as the operational
departments that manage the risks in their areas of responsibility on a daily basis.

Each risk is assigned a level of control that corresponds to the systems of selecting and implementing the measures aimed
at reducing the risk. The company may envisage a number of measures: reduction, transfer, suppression or acceptance of a
risk. The choice of how to manage a risk will involve weighing opportunities against the costs of risk management measures,
while also taking account of their possible effects on the likelihood and/or consequences of the risk occurring. The controls
to be put in place fall under the scope of the internal control system. In this way, the internal control system contributes to
the management of risks incurred in the business’s activities.

The risk manager and internal audit monitor major risks and new or emerging risks and any significant changes are reported
to the Executive Committee and to the Audit Committee.

The mapping of risks is updated periodically. This risk identification and management approach strengthens awareness of
the Group’s risks and builds on existing work in order to establish appropriate action plans.


-----

**b)** **Internal control components**

Internal control comprises five closely related components, as follows:

control environment;

risk assessment;

control activities;

information and communication;

monitoring.

They are implemented by the Group as follows:

**i)** **Control environment**

The control environment, which is key to the internal control system and essential for good risk management and procedural
application, is based on human behaviour and is the foundation for other internal control elements.

Getlink SE’s control environment is based on the following components:

A general human resources policy which sets out the Group’s values and operating principles, as well as the key measures
in place in relation to working conditions and practices, staff training and development and standards of conduct.

The interest shown by the Board of Directors in internal control and general management’s will to continuously improve
operational processes.

The definition of responsibilities through an organisation chart, distributed on the intranet and the introduction of a
delegation of authority procedure and approval limits.

The existence of operating policies and procedures, documented for all the main business segments.

The existence of a formal monthly reporting process and regular budget reviews ensuring good financial management
within the business.

**ii)** **Risk assessment**

Every business is faced with external and internal risks that may prevent the full realisation of its objectives.

The Group relies on several processes to identify the risks and take them into account:

The annual budget and five-year plan set the operating and commercial objectives in the business’s main fields of activity
and the financial results expected. They are presented to the Board of Directors of Getlink SE after having been reviewed
by the Audit Committee.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are established for the main identified risk areas, including safety, commercial
performance and operational reliability and are reported weekly basis to members of the Executive Committee.

An annual risk review as described in section 3.4.2.a above.

**iii)** **Control activities**

Control activities proportionate to the specific challenges of each process seek to provide assurance that the necessary
measures are taken to control the risks likely to impact the attainment of objectives. Application of standards and procedures
contributes to the implementation of management directives. Control activities are carried out at all hierarchical and
functional levels of the company. For each business area, specific measures are recommended to respect the key points of
internal control.

Within the Group, ethics and compliance are supervised by the Board of Directors through the work of its Ethics and CSR
Committee, which ensures the communication through the whole organisation of the ethics, culture and principles applicable
to executives, as well as all team members, and which serve as the basis for the work of the other Board committees and
executive and corporate officers. The implementation of this approach is led by an internal working group (the Compliance
Steering Group) which brings the internal control, internal audit, legal, human resources and public affairs departments
together to oversee compliance with the rules set out in the Ethics Charter and the procedures contained in it, with the
responsibilities being allocated to the relevant departments. The compliance convergences and links are set out in a matrix
of compliance topics with owners allocated to each topic. The legal department is thus the owner of the topics relating to
personal data. The Board secretariat monitors financial market laws and regulations, as well as best practice with regard to
corporate governance, and ensures they are transposed into internal procedures. Deployment in the subsidiaries is carried
out by a network of compliance representatives.

The Group’s ethics system, which is based on the Group's values and Ethics Charter, is supplemented by various policies. The
aim of this system is to develop an ethical culture among all new team members that promotes integrity of behaviour, to
raise individual awareness of compliance with international and national laws and regulations and to highlight initiatives
aimed at strengthening the prevention system and avoiding infringements, breaches or negligence in these areas. Since
2019, a new Ethics Charter, which has a more user-friendly format containing a greater number of illustrations and offering
a practical guide to ethics, forms the bedrock underpinning all internal policies, codes of conduct and specific procedures
adopted by Getlink including anti-corruption policy, competition policy and protection of personal data. A Securities Ethics
Charter sets out the measures to prevent insider trading and establishes “trading closed periods”.

In the interests of continual improvement, as early as 2019 Getlink launched an awareness programme, which is called Get
Compliant. In accordance with the “zero tolerance” message promoted at the highest levels in the organisation with regard
to all types of corruption, the Group, which is subject to the Sapin II law, has defined a rigorous corruption risk prevention


-----

programme which is applicable to all Group entities and is founded on team member training and information campaigns
to raise awareness of major fraud and corruption risks. A map of corruption and influence peddling has been created in
conjunction with internal stakeholders in order to identify the types of risks to which the Group could be exposed in the
course of its operations. A third-party evaluation procedure has also been developed with several levels of controls. An anticorruption policy and a whistleblowing system are in place. All team members can contact the Group’s ethics officer if they
consider that communicating information to a line manager could present difficulties or not result in the proper follow-up.

The Group is keen to comply with local tax laws and regulations so from the outset it has relied on a network of tax
professionals to ensure compliance with its obligations in this area and thus limit tax risk to a reasonable and customary
level. A tax model has been set up incorporating the impact of medium- and long-term changes.

The publication of the tax strategy and the annual update of the risk mapping and the various means of control covering tax
evasion are control measures in place. Each year, in accordance with the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 the Group maps its
risk of exposure to facilitating tax evasion and the appropriate prevention procedures are in place.

With regard to Human Resources, the French Group Committee provides an opportunity for the mutual sharing of
information, an exchange of viewpoints and dialogue between French employee representatives and the Group’s
management on strategic objectives and key staff issues and to keep employees abreast of developments and the future
outlook for the Group. The European Company Council is the staff representative body representing staff in France and the
United Kingdom (trade union or elected representatives) and Group management: this consultation and dialogue body at
European level provides a forum for communicating information on the major issues concerning the European company.
A Group intranet site enables each and every team member to have access to information on his or her subsidiary and those
of Getlink SE, particularly where internal control procedures are concerned.

In the area of Corporate Social Responsibility, the Group has adopted a formal CSR policy (signed on 13 March 2015) that is
upheld and supported at the highest level of the organisation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. It outlines the
principles and the commitments of the Group, describes the social, territorial, environmental, economic and ethical
challenges, and defines the commitments to be met. Since 2018, the Group has published a NFPS (non-financial performance
statement). Getlink has an organisation and structured governance as set out in section 6.3 of this Universal Registration
Document, which was strengthened in 2019 by the creation of a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) team.

Since 2013, the Group has also been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and has fully embraced its ten key
principles, notably those relating to human rights and employment law.

With regard to procurement, the Code of Conduct for Purchasing, brought up to date in 2011, is the guide to practices and
ethics that enables each team member to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. It also helps develop a climate
of trust between Group representatives and persons outside the business. Formal purchasing procedures and delegations
of authority are in place for the management and approval of purchases. Finally, the call for tender procedures specify the
conditions of competition and referencing for the main suppliers.

In respect of safety, procedures related to the protection of people, goods and data underpin the risk cover principles in
terms of organisation and safety. The Board’s Safety and Security Committee monitors performance in these areas by means
of quarterly reports from the security and sustainable development department. These include the reporting of safety
performance against target, the results of safety evaluations and an update on security matters. The Safety and Security
Committee has created two subgroups, one responsible for emergency planning and the BINAT exercises and the other for
security issues. Furthermore, a formal document entitled SMS (Safety Management System) is updated as necessary and at
least once every five years by the safety and sustainable development department. This document identifies the major risks
to which the business’s customers, employees, sub-contractors and visitors are exposed, and the measures in place to
manage them. The SMS is formally approved by the Safety Authority of the Intergovernmental Commission.

In respect of insurance, the Group chooses to call only on top ranking insurers. It uses programmes to cover, in particular,
the third-party liability of all its entities and material damage and business interruption consequent upon a covered loss. An
analysis of the relevance of insurance coverage is carried out every three years, and is revised during the renewal of insurance
policies.

With regard to treasury activities, an operational treasury risk management committee has been set up: it regularly examines
fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and the use of financial instruments, as well as monitoring cash flows, liquidity
and compliance with the restrictions imposed by banking agreements. The investment and cash management policies are
approved annually by the Board of Directors of Getlink SE. The treasury plan enables monitoring within a foreseeable
time-scale of the liquidity of each of the various Group entities.

The Group is putting a tool in place to model its processes in order to control and secure its activities according to risk, the
essential aim of which is to achieve a clear distinction between objectives, risks and controls.


-----

**iv)** **Internal information and communication**

The Group ensures the internal distribution of relevant and reliable information, knowledge of which enables each individual
to exercise their responsibilities.

The Board of Directors of Getlink SE is regularly provided with the information that it requires:

annually, the strategic plan and the annual budget; and

monthly, a report containing information on financial results and the financial position and a summary of the operational
and commercial performance.

The Audit Committee, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Safety and Security Committee and the Ethics and
CSR Committee of the Board of Getlink SE receive reports relating to their work at each of their periodic meetings. The
chairmen of these committees keep the Board of Directors of Getlink SE informed of the work of their committees.

The members of the Executive Committee of Getlink SE regularly receive information and papers on the following topics:

the financial results and analysis of performance in relation to the budget;

a “dashboard” containing the key performance indicators for each business segment (safety, commercial performance
and market share, productivity and operational reliability, quality of service, employee headcount and related statistics,
financial results with comparison against the previous year, the budget and against the most recent forecasts);

key information related to safety, human resources, operations, and to commercial and financial performance.

Regular communication with Group personnel is achieved through the Group intranet and other means of digital
communication which allows each team member to obtain information on the Group’s main activities and on new policies
and procedures applicable within the business. In addition, a newsletter is produced for each subsidiary. Periodic meetings
referred to the Management Forum bring together key managers.

**v)** **Monitoring and supervision**

The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors oversee the internal control monitoring arrangements. Monitoring forms
part of the Group’s day-to-day operations, and includes regular management and supervisory activities, as well as the work
carried out by the audit functions. During 2020 and up to the date of this Universal Registration Document, the Group has
not identified any major shortcomings in its internal control system.

Monitoring and supervision fall to the following parties:

**General management**

The mission of general management is to define the strategic aspects of the risk management and internal control systems
and to ensure their implementation. To do so, it is supported by the operational departments.

**The Audit Committee**

Twice a year, the Committee examines the internal audit plan and its objectives, as well as the general conclusions of internal
audit missions. The initiatives and projects that shape internal control are also presented to it. The Audit Committee then
reports on its activities to the Board.

**The Group finance department**

The Group finance department is responsible for all finance functions within the Group, through its centralised functions
(planning, reporting, consolidation, tax matters, accounting and cash) and through its functional links with the financial
director of each segment. It encourages a sound understanding of the Group’s internal control rules as well as their
dissemination and proper application, and it monitors the progress of internal control and risk management projects.

The risk management and internal control department reports to the Group’s finance department. This department is
responsible for implementation and monitoring of the key risk mapping in order to minimise the impact of adverse events
and fully capitalise on opportunities. It is also tasked with the development and deployment of internal control throughout
the entire Group. Alongside professional experts, it coordinates the implementation of projects and internal control tasks
decided by general management.

**The internal audit department**

The internal audit department reports to the Group’s general management. Twice a year, the Head of internal audit reports
to the Audit Committee on the work undertaken by the internal audit department. Internal audit plans audit work in order
to ensure appropriate coverage of all the main risk factors and it submits an audit plan to the Audit Committee. A formal
process exists for the correction of weaknesses highlighted in internal audit reports. The status of corrective actions is
presented to the Audit Committee.

The Internal audit department comprises a central team which performs regular consulting and assurance assignments in
the business units, as well as on corporate or cross-departmental subjects. For each assignment, a report is drawn up stating
the general opinion on the level of control over the risks inherent to the activity concerned, and the findings identified as
well as its recommendations in the form of an action plan to be implemented by the audited entity. This report is passed on
to the functional department concerned and to the Chief Executive Officer.


-----

An integral part of the corporate risk assessment, Internal audit takes part in the annual risk review and assesses the
appropriateness and effectiveness of measures in place to mitigate the identified risks. The results of the corporate risk
assessment and the internal audit review are presented to the Audit Committee.

The internal audit department maps the insurance activities showing the extent of coverage for the major risks faced by the
organisation. In particular, internal audit consults the Safety and Security Committee each year to identify all the insurance
activity requirements in these areas.

Since 2012, the quality of the internal audit department’s work has been evaluated by IFACI (Institut français de l’audit et du
contrôle internes – the French institute of internal audit and control), under the International Professional Practices
Framework (IPPF) for the internal audit profession.

**Specific committees**

The Group has a number of specific committees relating to internal control:

the investment committee which endorses the Group’s major investment projects;

the treasury risk management committee;

the risk management committee; and

the steering compliance committee.

The Concessionaires have set up operational committees for the following specific areas:

safety;

operating performance (service quality and customer experience);

IT projects; and

information systems security bringing together all Group departments to identify cyber security risks.

Specific monitoring groups oversee progress achieved in key projects.

**3.4.3** **INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF FINANCIAL AND**

**ACCOUNTING INFORMATION**

**a)** **Monitoring the accounting and financial structure**

**i)** **Structure**

The Group’s finance department is responsible for preparing the Group’s parent and consolidated financial statements and
implementing the internal control systems related to finance and accounting. To this end, it has put in place a monitoring
function to identify and manage the main risks that could potentially impact the preparation of accounting and financial
information published by the Group:

it ensures the Group has the organisation and resources in place to record its transactions accurately and in full;

it oversees, via the management reporting processes, the reliability of the published accounting and financial information;

it supervises the preparation and year-end closing of the financial statements, paying particular attention to the
accounting treatment of major or complex transactions, the quality of estimates used in the consolidated financial
statements and the year-end closing procedures that are considered sensitive; and

it is informed of the statutory auditors’ conclusions drawn from their work on the parent company and consolidated
financial statements. It also keeps itself abreast of any significant risks or major weakness in internal control notified by
the statutory auditors and makes sure that these are addressed via the corrective actions implemented by the Group.

Financial management is centralised in the Group’s finance department, which is responsible for defining the Group’s
accounting rules and policies, cash management, consolidation of the Group financial statements and financial reporting.
This centralised responsibility covers all the Group accounting entities in France and the United Kingdom.

Accounts management is performed by each entity in accordance with the Group’s accounting principles. Data is then passed
to the Group’s finance department for consolidation.

The Audit Committee plays a crucial role in controlling the Group’s financial reporting and in preparatory work for the
approval of the annual financial statements and consideration of the interim financial statements by the Board, in particular:

any changes to accounting policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee;

the Group finance department submits a report to the Audit Committee on major accounting and reporting issues and
options at each accounts closing;

the Audit Committee reviews the annual and half-year consolidated financial statements before their presentation to the
Getlink SE Board;

at its meetings, the Committee receives formal reports drawn up by the statutory auditors, financial management, internal
audit and the treasury and risk management departments.


-----

**ii)** **The accounting rules**

The quality of accounting and financial information relies on observance of the accounting rules and principles during both
the accounts production process and the year-end closing process, to ensure that the information contained in the financial
statements is true and fair.

The rules to be observed for accounts production and in the upstream processes are the following: truthfulness of
transactions and events recorded, completeness of all transactions and events, accurate measurement of transactions
amounts, the accruals principle and appropriate classification of transactions and events in the accounts.

The rules to be observed for the year-end closing process are the following: existence of assets and liabilities, rights and
obligations, completeness of assets and liabilities, accurate measurement and allocation of assets and liabilities, appropriate
presentation and intelligibility of the financial information, truthfulness of rights and obligations, accurate measurement and
assessment of financial information.

These rules are set forth in written procedures and cover all operations performed by the Group’s financial control
department; they are accessible and are conveyed to the various Group entities.

**iii)** **Organisation and security of information systems**

A single integrated accounting system, SAP, is used across all accounting entities. The upload of transactions and accounting
data from other SAP modules is automatic. For systems outside the integrated SAP environment – principally in the areas of
passenger sales – accounting data uploads are automated. Reconciliation and verification controls are in place to ensure the
completeness and accuracy of these interfaces.

The IT systems and environment are organised to ensure secure, reliable, accessible and relevant provision of accounting
and financial information. Controls are in place to ensure the physical security of hardware and software, the integrity of data
and the continuity of operation of the major computer systems. The Group has set up enhanced system protection measures
in the face of increasing risks of unauthorised intrusion into information systems and its possible consequences, from
inappropriate access to loss of data.

**b)** **Processes involved in the preparation of accounting and financial information**

**i)** **Transaction accounting**

The reliability of published financial information depends on adequate controls over the transactions giving rise to
accounting entries to ensure they are accurate, complete and compliant with the standards in force. These controls are
applied for all processes feeding into the accounts, particularly operating revenue, purchases, inventory control, fixed assets,
payroll and treasury, in addition to capital transactions and provisions and commitments. The month-end closures, including
detailed verification of the main revenue and expenditure accounts, are carried out by the budget controllers. Formal balance
sheet reconciliations are also carried out by the accounts department.

Financial and management accounting is integrated and prepared using the same source data. Monthly reconciliations are
carried out between management accounting data and the accounting data used to prepare the published accounting and
financial information.

**ii)** **Consolidation**

Consolidation of the financial statements of the various Group entities is carried out centrally by the Group’s finance
department, which ensures that the scope and rules of consolidation are kept up to date.

There is a formal process for preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements that includes:

advance reporting dates allowing the Group to anticipate the accounting treatment of complex transactions;

publication by the Group’s finance department of a timetable and period-end closing instructions for the subsidiaries;

preparation of consolidation packages by subsidiaries to ensure standardisation in the application of Group accounting
policies and in the information reported in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.


-----

**iii)** **External communication of financial information**

An annual timetable is drawn up by the Group’s finance department setting out the periodic obligations related to the
provision of accounting and financial communications to the market.

Formal processes are in place to ensure that:

information is communicated externally in a timely manner and in compliance with the laws and regulations in force;

sensitive information remains confidential;

all information, including non-accounting information presented in support of financial communications, is checked
before release;

information meeting the definition of inside information is communicated to the market at the right time, in compliance
with the relevant rules.

**iv)** **Statutory auditors**

Independently of the Group’s finance department, the statutory auditors, as part of their work to audit and certify the
financial statements, carry out a review of the internal control procedures used to prepare and ensure the quality of the
financial statements.

by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to determine the
remuneration and benefits of any kind granted to the corporate officers and the total remuneration paid during the year or
attributed for the year. The contents of this corporate governance report are listed in detail in the Table of Cross-References
annexed to this Universal Registration Document and cover the following matters:

the list of offices and appointments in any company held by all corporate officers during the past financial year;

regulated agreements;

current authorisations agreed by the shareholders in general meeting in relation to increases in capital and the use made

officers and the total remuneration paid during the financial year;

the limitations, if any, on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer;

the corporate governance code which Getlink SE has applied; and

the specific arrangements relating to the participation of shareholders in general meetings.

The Company Secretary to the Board of Directors was mandated to compile the preliminary content of the corporate
governance report, which was prepared based on the work of various departments and functions including the following:
finance, internal audit, internal control, human resources and legal. The report was presented to the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee, the Ethics and CSR Committee and the statutory auditors. It was submitted
to general management which considers it to be consistent with the systems in place within the Group. The Board approved
it on 24 February 2021.

The corporate governance code to which Getlink SE refers is the code for listed companies drawn up by the Association
Française des Entreprises Privées (AFEP) and the Mouvement des Entreprises de France (MEDEF) (hereafter referred to as the
Afep/Medef Code).

**4.1** **GENERAL MANAGEMENT**

**4.1.1** **CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS**

As announced on 30 January 2020, on 1 July 2020 the Board of Directors implemented a governance structure separating
the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in which Jacques Gounon remains Chairman of the Board of Directors,
whilst Yann Leriche takes up the role of Chief Executive Officer as the sole chief executive officer.

From March 2007 onwards, the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer were joined with Jacques Gounon carrying out
the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, this mode of governance having been considered more
appropriate in a period of major restructuring and refinancing. The Group governance structure was adjusted to the specific
needs of the organisation at that time and was part of a continual bid to support the overall development vision of the
business:

to ensure the viability of the business in the first phase of Getlink SE’s history; and

to prioritise more effective and responsive management in the second phase of Getlink SE’s history, in order to promote
the organisation’s development.

**Separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer**

On 30 January 2020, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board of Directors decided to implement
the separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. From 1 July 2020, the roles are
being carried out by:

Jacques Gounon, Chairman of the Board of Directors for the duration of his term as a director until the end of the General
Meeting called to approve the accounts for the year ending 31 December 2021, and

Yann Leriche, Chief Executive Officer for an initial term of office of the same length as that of directors i.e. four years.

Getlink’s Board has confirmed its choice of a governance model that ensures the separation of executive responsibilities
from the functions of Chairman and which is in line with best corporate governance practices. This new structure, combined
with the progressive rotation of Board members, will further enhance the efficiency and agility of the Board’s operations.

The Board of Directors considers that this uncoupled governance structure is the best choice for Getlink. The decision to
separate the roles is intended to enable Getlink SE to benefit both from the Chief Executive Officer’s knowledge and industrial
expertise in the transport and mobility sector in the broadest sense as well as the operational, safety and technical constraints


-----

of these activities set against the international context and from the Chairman’s international stature and his credibility and
experience in binational relations, particularly in the context of the implementation of Brexit.

The complementary profiles of Jacques Gounon and Yann Leriche allow a harmonious governance of the Group, based on a
balanced and complementary distribution of the respective roles of the Chairman and the CEO. This separation of functions
will allow the succession of Jacques Gounon to be implemented under the best possible conditions, while ensuring a
transition phase so that the evolution of Getlink’s strategy is carried out in accordance with the company’s binational culture
and values. This governance structure will allow Yann Leriche to dedicate himself fully to the pursuit of programmes of
excellence in the development of the organisation, while benefiting from Jacques Gounon’s strategic vision and his
knowledge of the Group acquired during his years as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

**In-depth process established by collective decision of the Board of Directors**

Getlink SE has followed a thorough, well-thought out and robust process for the evolution of governance agreed by
collective decision of the Board of Directors and led by the Nominations Committee.

The Nominations Committee, after having analysed Getlink’s governance and with the assistance of a governance
consulting firm, drew up a Board proposal for an objective process for identifying, assessing and selecting internal talent
and external candidates and a detailed roadmap.

The Board of Directors agreed the process then, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, determined
the key competencies of the individuals sought and the resulting selection criteria.

After hearing presentations from various recruitment firms, the Nominations Committee appointed a firm and actively
managed its involvement. The Committee approved the evaluation methodology and developed a research plan in
conjunction with the firm.

The Nominations Committee kept to the methodology of a rigorous evaluation of potential candidates that enabled it
to assess, among other things, their experience, past performance, potential, development needs and cultural fit. This
evaluation was conducted by external experts recognised for the rigour of their methodology. The Nominations
Committee considered that this proven and objective methodology combining interviews based on professional
experience with interpersonal questionnaires, practical case studies and 360-degree references underpinned the
relevance of the evaluation and enable it to unlock a rounded, complete and solid image of the person and an objective
overview when the Board came to take its decision.

The Nominations Committee analysed the initial list of potential candidates in order to draw up a short list. The final
selection decision was made collectively by all members of the Board of Directors after holding interviews in plenary
session with the final candidates.

The Board of Directors was kept informed of the work of the Nominations Committee at each meeting and each stage
of the process was presented to the Board of Directors.

**Powers of the Chairman of the Board of Directors**

In accordance with French law the Chairman of the Board organises and directs the work of the Board of Directors, on which
he reports to the General Meeting. He ensures the proper functioning of the bodies of Getlink SE and, in particular, that the
Directors are able to carry out their duties. In particular, he may request communication of any document or information
that may help the Board of Directors in preparing its meetings.

In order to ensure a smooth and gradual transition, particularly in the context of the uncertainties related to Brexit, and to
prepare for the entry into office of the Chief Executive Officer at the head of Getlink in the best possible conditions, the
Board of Directors had decided to entrust the Chairman of the Board of Directors with enhanced responsibilities in order to
allow in-depth consultation between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer on the major issues affecting the life of
the Group and to give the Chairman the capacity to represent Getlink in its high-level relations. Against the background of
the public health crisis, the Board of Directors considers that the best way to ensure the efficiency, balance, stability and
visibility of governance during this key period for the company is to maintain the current governance and the strengthened
collaboration that exists between the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer.

In addition to the general powers provided for by law, the Chairman of the Board of Directors was entrusted, on a temporary
basis and in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer, with the following specific responsibilities by the Board of
Directors’ Internal Rules. The Chairman of the Board of Directors will have a special mandate for the purposes of:

representing the Group in its high-level relations, such as with public authorities, financial institutions and/or key
stakeholders, both nationally and internationally;

representing the Board of Directors in its relations with shareholders and investors and assuming a role in driving strategy
in close coordination with the Chief Executive Officer;

providing support to executive management on issues affecting the balance and cohesion between the French and British
components of the Group and its teams.

In all these specific responsibilities, the Chairman of the Board of Directors acts in close coordination with the Chief Executive
Officer, who is solely responsible for the management and operational leadership of Getlink. The Chairman’s responsibilities
are of a contributory nature and do not confer any executive power on him.


-----

**Powers of the Chief Executive Officer**

The Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the company. He
carries out his powers within the scope of the corporate purpose and subject to the powers expressly conferred by law on
shareholders and on the Board of Directors. He represents the company in its dealings with third parties.

Getlink SE is bound by decisions of the Chief Executive Officer that do not fall within its corporate purpose, unless it can be
proven that the third party knew or should have known in the circumstances that the decision exceeded such purpose.
However, the publication of the company’s Articles of Association does not alone constitute such proof.

**Limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer**

The provisions of the Articles of Association or decisions of the Board of Directors limiting the powers of the Chief Executive
Officer may not be invoked against third parties.

The Internal Rules of the Board of Directors have been revised to specify, as of the Chief Executive Officer’s entry into office
on 1 July 2020, the limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer for certain decisions which, due to their purpose
or amount, will be subject to prior approval by the Board of Directors. Without prejudice to the legal provisions relating to
the authorisations that must be granted by the Board of Directors (regulated agreements, sureties, endorsements and
guarantees, transfers of equity interests or real estate etc), the prior authorisation of the Board of Directors is required for
transactions that are likely to affect Getlink’s results, balance sheet structure or risk profile.

The Chief Executive Officer must obtain the prior approval of the Board of Directors for the following transactions:

**Nature of the operation** **Threshold**


Acquisition and disposal of assets or shareholdings, investment or divestment, creation, acquisition or disposal of any
subsidiary or shareholding, or internal restructuring

Borrowing, to the extent compatible with the contracts and commitments outstanding at the time, refinancing or early
repayment


€20 million

€10 million


All transactions with an impact on shareholders’ equity €10 million

Litigation: transactions, compromise agreements €10 million

When such transactions, decisions or commitments give rise to successive payments to third parties linked to the
achievement of results or objectives, the above-mentioned limits shall be assessed by aggregating these various payments.
The prior approval procedure is not applicable to intra-group transactions and decisions.

The new Group governance structure is adapted to the specific needs of the organisation and is part of a continual bid to
support the overall development vision of the business.


The Board sets the term of office of the Chief Executive Officer.


The Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of Getlink SE. He
exercises his powers within the scope of the corporate purpose and subject to the powers expressly conferred by law on
shareholders and on the Board, as well as the limitations imposed by the Internal Rules described in this section.

The Chief Executive Officer represents Getlink SE in its relations with third parties. Getlink SE is bound by decisions of the
Chief Executive Officer that do not fall within its corporate purpose, unless it can be proven that the third party knew or
should have known in the circumstances that the decision exceeded such purpose. However, the publication of the
company’s Articles of Association does not alone constitute such proof. Provisions of the Articles of Association and
decisions of the Board limiting the powers of the Chief Executive Officer are not binding on third parties.

The Articles of Association provide that no person may be appointed as Chief Executive Officer or Deputy Chief Executive
Officer if they are aged over 68 years old.

The Board may terminate the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer at any time. The Board may also terminate the
appointment of the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.


**Deputy Chief Executive Officers**

In the context of the implementation of the uncoupled governance structure, the Board of Directors of Getlink SE decided
at its meeting of 6 March 2020 to remove the role of Deputy Chief Executive Officer and therefore terminated the office of
Deputy Chief Executive Officer with effect from 15 March 2020.

As at the date of this Universal Registration Document, Getlink SE does not have a Deputy Chief Executive Officer in post.


The Deputy Chief Executive Officer assists the Chief Executive Officer. With regard to third parties, the Deputy Chief
Executive Officer represents the company in the same manner as the Chief Executive Officer and, pursuant to article L. 22556, II sub-paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code, he has the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer. The
maximum number of Deputy Chief Executive Officers is three. If the Chief Executive Officer were to cease to exercise or
be prevented from exercising his duties, the deputy chief executive officers, if any, continue to carry out their duties and
fulfil their role, unless decided otherwise by the Board, until a new Chief Executive Officer is appointed.


-----

At the date of filing of this Universal Registration Document, the Group's general management is carried out by Yann Leriche,

executive officers:

allocations limited by individual;

restrictive rules for holding and retaining shares;

prohibition of leveraged transactions in Getlink securities or speculative transactions in any performance shares; and

definitive allocation (in the event of the executive's departure) at best pro rata based on the executive's actual presence
within the Group during the performance appraisal period.

As indicated in section 4.2.5.a.i of this Universal Registration Document, the Articles of Association set a minimum quantity
of shares that Directors must hold until the end of their term of office. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and, subject
to the vote of the General Meeting of 28 April 2021 on his appointment to the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer
are bound by this statutory shareholding requirement from the date they take office.

** The two directors representing the employees are not taken into account for the calculation of the independence percentage, in accordance with the
Afep/Medef Code, nor for the calculation of the parity percentage in accordance with the currently applicable provisions of the French Commercial Code
nor, for the sake of consistency, for the international representation percentage.

**Changes in the Board of Directors in 2020**

On 30 April 2020, following the proposal of the Board of Directors, the General Meeting decided:

to appoint two new directors, Jean-Marc Janaillac to replace Colette Neuville on 30 April 2020 and Sharon Flood to
replace Philippe Vasseur on 1 October 2020; and

to allow the possibility of appointing an additional staff representative director to join the Board and represent staff
whose employment contracts are governed by English law.

On 5 November 2020, the Board of Directors co-opted Carlo Bertazzo as a Director to replace Giancarlo Guenzi, who
resigned, for the remainder of his predecessor’s term of office. Ratification of this co-option will be proposed at the Ordinary
General Meeting of Getlink SE to be held on 28 April 2021.

**Board renewal plan**

The Board of Directors reviewed the renewal of its members, taking into account the expertise of the directors and the need
to keep independence and international and female representation on the Board. The Board of Directors, on the
recommendation of the Nominations Committee, paid particular attention to the skills, experience and knowledge of the
Group’s businesses that each director must possess in order to participate effectively in the work of the Board and its
committees.

The Board of Directors decided to harmonise the rotation of members since it wished to keep the size of the Board of
Directors at a maximum of 15 members. In doing so, it had regard to the structure of the Board of Directors in terms of
number, independence, gender parity, age, international representation and skills. It also drew on the consequences of the
application of the 12-year term of office criterion for the assessment of independence as well as the continuing work to
lower the average age of the Board members. As a result, the Board of Directors has drawn up a plan to stagger the terms
of office of directors.


-----

**Staggering of terms of office: changes in the composition of the Board of Directors**

In order to continue the work begun in 2018 towards a harmonious renewal of the terms of office of its members, the Board
of Directors proposed to the General Meeting held on 30 April 2020, which resolution was approved, the following staggering
of the directors’ terms of office:

one director was exceptionally renewed for a single year: Peter Levene’s term was extended until 2021, until the end of
the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2020 financial year;

two directors were exceptionally renewed for two years: Jean-Pierre Trotignon’s and Perrette Rey’s terms were extended
until 2022, until the end of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2021 financial year;

one director was exceptionally renewed for three years: Colette Lewiner’s term was extended until 2023, until the end of
the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2022 financial year; and

the term of office of Colette Neuville was not proposed for renewal.

In order to preserve the collective efficiency of the Board, as well as the desired level of independence within the Board of
Directors and to allow the entry into the Board of Directors of members with less than 12 years of office who can be qualified
as independent in light of the criteria set forth in the Afep/Medef Code, Philippe Vasseur has agreed to end his term of office
after the 2020 General Meeting i.e. before the end of his term of office in 2022.

The Afep/Medef Code considers that after 12 years of service, a director can no longer be considered as independent.
Although this rule does not ipso facto lead to the resignation of the directors concerned, the directors initiated a collective
discussion on this subject within the Corporate Committee and the Nominations Committee and the Board of Directors
decided on the recommendation of those Committees to introduce a good conduct guideline in the Board of Directors’
Internal Rules such that:

independent directors with more than 12 years of service will resign from office no later than 12 months after reaching
12 years of service; and

directors having reached the age of 80 will resign from office no later than 12 months after their 80[th] birthday.

The Directors’ CVs are set out in this section 4.2.1.

**Director selection process**

Getlink SE’s selection process is designed to appoint a diverse set of highly competent directors and officers with in-depth
knowledge and experience of the main sectors of activity. The factors taken into account, as described in the appendix to
the Board of Directors’ Internal Rules, are set out in section 4.2.5 of this Universal Registration Document.

Getlink SE follows a thorough appointment process by collective decision of the Board of Directors. With the assistance of a
governance consulting firm, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee draws up, when appropriate, a detailed roadmap
of the implementation of the Board succession plan and the research to be conducted.

The Committee appoints a recruitment firm to search for candidates meeting the set criteria and manages the involvement
of the recruitment firm. In conjunction with the firm, the Committee considers the initial list of potential candidates then a
short list before proceeding to hold interviews. The final decision is made collectively by all members of the Board of
Directors.

**2021 changes**

As a continuation of the work begun in 2018 and following the rotation of directors organised in 2020, the Board has decided
to propose to the General Meeting of 28 April 2021 that Yann Leriche, the Chief Executive Officer, be appointed to the Board
of Directors to replace Peter Levene, whose term of office is coming to an end, and to proceed with the appointment of a
UK staff representative to replace Tim Yeo who, having exceeded 12 years in office, has agreed to step down from the Board
to help maintain the level of independence of the Board. The staff representative director who will represent employees with
a UK contract of employment is Mark Cornwall, who was elected as an employee representative director by the European
Company Committee. These changes will take effect at the end of the General Meeting on 28 April 2021.

The table below sets out the anticipated changes to the composition of the Board of Directors and its committees for the
2021 financial year:

**4.2.4** **STATEMENTS REGARDING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS**

As at the date of this Universal Registration Document, there are no family connections between any of the members of the
Board or the Executive Committee.

In addition, as at the date of this Universal Registration Document, no member of the Board or the Executive Committee
has been:

convicted of fraud during the past five years;

implicated in any bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation proceedings during the past five years; nor

charged with any offence or any official public sanction by any statutory or regulatory authority during the past five years.

To Getlink SE’s knowledge, no Director or executive officer has been banned by a court from acting as a member of a board
of directors, a management or supervisory board of an issuer or from participating in the management or conducting the
business of an issuer during the past five years.

United Kingdom on 19 December 2013 and was placed in liquidation on 8 December 2014.

**4.2.5** **TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE PREPARATION AND ORGANISATION OF THE WORK OF THE BOARD**

**OF DIRECTORS**

**a)** **Composition and organisation of the Board of Directors**

**i)** **Board Directors**

At the date of this Universal Registration Document, the Board of Getlink SE has 15 Directors:

three non-independent directors;

two staff representative directors;

nine independent directors; and

one director previously qualified as independent but who is no longer considered independent now that his term of
office has reached 12 years.

The composition of the Board of Directors, subject to the vote on the resolutions by the General Meeting to be held on
28 April 2021, is set out in section 4.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document. The average age of the Directors is 63
(including staff representative directors); it will be reduced to 61 after the 2021 General Meeting.

The Board of Directors at the end of the General Meeting will be composed of eight independent directors, four nonindependent directors and three staff representative directors i.e. 67% independent directors excluding staff
representatives[23].

23 Directors representing staff are not taken into account for the calculation of the independence rate, in accordance with the Afep/Medef

Code.


-----

The Board of Directors includes six women and will have the same number of women at the end of the General Meeting of
28 April 2021, i.e. 50% of the Board of Directors (excluding staff representatives[24]), in compliance with the law of 27 January
2011 on the balanced representation of women and men on boards of directors.

The proportion of non-French resident directors will be 42% (excluding staff representatives).

The members of the Board of Directors of Getlink SE are very active: in 2020, there were a total of 29 meetings of the Board
(13 meetings) and its committees (16 meetings).

The expertise and complementary experience of the Directors is an advantage for the Group since they bring their industrial,
managerial, financial and scientific skills to the organisation and have a diversity of backgrounds with a mix of men/women,
ages and nationalities.

Board members are appointed, re-appointed and removed by the shareholders’ General Meeting. The Nomination and
Remuneration Committee assesses the composition and size of the Board, oversees the assessment process for candidates
for the role of member of the Board, determines whether such candidates are qualified to become Board Directors, in
accordance with the criteria set out by the Board, and makes recommendations to the Board with regard to the selection of
candidates.

The Board has agreed a diversity policy, recognising that a diverse Board encourages more efficient governance and more
enlightened decisions. The composition of the Board aims to balance experience, ability and independence in line with the
equality and diversity which reflect the binational nature of the business. Good synergy within the Board depends on the
diversity (in terms of nationality, skills and so on), equality and complementarity of its members. The Board, as a whole, must
also adequately reflect the communities within which the Group carries on its business (public/private; transport business;
rail infrastructure; cross-Channel market; Franco-British business; crisis management).

In accordance with its diversity policy, the Board ensures that it has the balance and breadth of skills that reflect the
challenges faced by the Group. The Board maintains a plurality of experience, nationalities and gender while ensuring that
all members are committed to the Group’s fundamental values.

**Competences of the Board members in 2020**

It is expected that Directors should have the following essential qualities:

to be mindful of the interests of the company;

to be a good judge, in particular of situations, strategies and people, based primarily on their experience;

to be able to anticipate so as to identify risks and strategic issues; and

to have integrity, be present, active and involved.

24 Directors representing staff are not taken into account in the calculation of the percentage, in accordance with article L. 225-27 of the

French Commercial Code.


-----

The following qualifications or attributes in particular are taken into account in the selection of Directors: management
and/or board experience, comprehensive and multi-disciplinary experience, integrity and professionalism, and personal
qualities required to contribute actively to the discussions of the Board.

On 30 April 2020, the shareholders voted in favour of a change to the Articles of Association so that each Getlink SE Director
is obliged to hold a number of ordinary Getlink SE shares corresponding to the equivalent of one year’s Director’s
remuneration (formerly called Directors’ fees). Directors have three years in which to acquire such shares. If any of the
Directors do not own the prescribed number of ordinary shares, they are deemed to have resigned unless the situation is
remedied within the appropriate time.

If there are one or more vacancies on the Board, the Board may, between two General Meetings, make interim appointments
in accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-24 of the French Commercial Code. The term of office of Directors
appointed as a replacement for another director is the remainder of the term of office of their predecessor.

In order to ensure the continuity, coherence and quality of the Board’s work, and in accordance with recommendation 13 of
the Afep/Medef Code relating to training of new directors, Getlink SE provides new Board members an induction period
designed to facilitate their integration and that is adapted to the individual’s skills, experience and expertise: site visits to
facilitate an understanding of the Group’s business, a briefing on economic/financial data, the Group’s key constitutional
documents and the possibility to attend external training, including with the Institut Français des Administrateurs (French
institute of directors). Induction arrangements for the two directors who joined Getlink in 2020 have been disrupted by the
public health crisis and the associated travel restrictions.

As at the date of this Universal Registration Document, the term of office of a Director in the Articles of Association is four
years. The appointment terminates at the end of the ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements of
the preceding financial year and held during the year in which their term of office expires. By way of exception and in order
to implement or keep a staggered renewal of directors' terms of office, the Ordinary General Meeting may appoint or renew
directors for terms equal to or less than four years or less in length.

All outgoing members are eligible for re-election. Notwithstanding the above, the number of Directors aged over 75 years
old serving on the Board as individuals or as permanent representatives of legal entities may not exceed one third (rounded
up to the nearest whole number, if applicable) of the number of Directors serving at the end of each General Meeting called
to approve the parent company’s financial statements. If this limit is exceeded, the oldest Director is automatically deemed
to have resigned. As a good conduct guideline, the Directors have agreed in the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors to
retire from office when they reach the age of 80.

**ii)** **Chairman of the Board**

The Board appoints one of its members as Chairman for a period identical to their term of office as Director, unless the Board
sets a shorter term. The Chairman must be an individual.

The Chairman of the Board represents the Board. He directs and organises the work of the Board and reports on this to the
General Meeting. He ensures the proper functioning of Getlink SE’s bodies and, in particular, that members of the Board are
able to perform their duties.

The age limit for the position of Chairman of the Board is 70. The term of office of the Chairman expires on the date of the
ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements of the financial year during which the serving Chairman
reaches the age limit. However, the Board may extend or renew the term of office of the Chairman for additional one-year
periods, up to five times.

Should the Chairman be temporarily unable to carry out his duties or in the event of his death, the Board may appoint a
Director to serve in his place. When the impediment is temporary, the appointment is for a limited period, which may be
renewed. In the event of the incumbent’s death, the appointment is effective until a new Chairman is appointed.

**iii)** **Meetings of the Board**

The Board meets as frequently as the interests of the company require and at least three times each year. Meetings are called
by the Chairman or by the Director designated to act in the Chairman’s place and are held at the registered office or at any
other place specified by the person who calls the meeting. However, if the Board has not met for more than two months,
Directors representing at least one third of the members of the Board and, if appointed, the Chief Executive Officer, may
request that the Chairman call a meeting on a specific agenda.

Meetings of the Board are conducted in French with a free translation into English. Documents provided to members for
meetings of the Board, as well as minutes of the meeting, are prepared in French with a free translation into English.


-----

The Shareholders' Meeting held on 30 April 2020 amended the Articles of Association so as to give the Board of Directors
the power to take written decisions as provided for in the third paragraph of article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial
Code. Thus, at the Chairman's initiative, the Board of Directors may adopt certain decisions by written consultation, provided
that they are included in the list provided for by law, namely:

the provisional appointment of Board members:

   - when there is a vacancy due to the death or resignation of a director;

   - when the number of directors is less than the legal or statutory minimum required;

   - when the composition of the Board of Directors no longer respects the proportion of each sex provided for by law;

the authorisation of sureties, endorsements and guarantees given by the company;

updating the Articles of Association to comply with legal and regulatory provisions as delegated by the extraordinary
general meeting;

the convening of the General Meeting;

the transfer of the head office within the same French département; and

more generally any decision falling within its own remit expressly referred to by the law or regulations in force.

**iv)** **Quorum**

The presence of at least one half of the serving members is required for a meeting of the Board to proceed to business. The
Internal Rules of the Board provide that members are deemed to be present within the scope of article L. 225-37 of the
French Commercial Code, for the purpose of calculating the quorum and majority, when they participate by videoconference
or other means of telecommunication that enable them to be identified and to participate in the meeting in accordance with
governing laws and regulations. This provision does not apply for the approval of decisions referred to in articles L. 232-1
and L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code.

In the event of a directors’ written resolution, the directors are deemed to be "present or represented" if they have replied
in writing within the prescribed time limit.

**v)** **Majority**

Decisions are taken by a majority of members present or represented, with the Chairman casting the deciding vote in the
event of a tied vote.

**vi)** **Powers**

The Board determines Getlink SE’s business objectives and oversees their implementation. Subject to the powers expressly
granted to shareholders in General Meetings and within the limits of the corporate purpose, the Board may consider any
matter affecting the proper functioning of Getlink SE and takes decisions in this respect in the interest of all shareholders.

The Board of Directors is committed to promoting the creation of long-term value in the organisation by considering the
social and environmental challenges of its activities. The Board regularly considers, in connection with the strategy it has
defined, financial, legal, operational, social and environmental and other opportunities and risks, as well as the measures
taken as a result. The Board of Directors ensures, where appropriate, that a system is in place to prevent and detect corruption
and influence peddling. It also ensures that executive corporate officers implement a policy of non-discrimination and
diversity, in particular with regard to the balanced representation of women and men on management bodies.

In its relations with third parties, Getlink SE is bound by decisions of the Board that do not fall within its corporate purpose,
unless it can prove that the third party knew or should have known in the circumstances that the decision exceeded the
corporate purpose. However, the publication of the Articles of Association does not alone constitute such proof.

The Board may carry out such controls and checks as it deems appropriate. Each Director receives all information and
documents needed to perform their duties in accordance with the conditions set out in the Internal Rules of the Board,
particularly as regards confidentiality.

The Board may decide to establish committees for the purpose of considering issues that the Board or its Chairman may
submit for their review. The Board determines the composition and terms of reference of the said committees, which conduct
their business under the responsibility of the Board. The Board also determines the remuneration of the committee members,
if any.

The Board decides or authorises the issue of debt securities pursuant to article L. 228-40 of the French Commercial Code,
unless the General Meeting resolves to exercise this power.

**vii)** **Board members’ rights, information and ethics (Ethics Charter, code of conduct, Internal Rules)**

From the outset the Group has been built on strong values, which ensure cohesion and ensure its future and its development.
The Board is committed to promoting these values within the Group, as well as best practice in governance and ethics.


-----

**Governance**

The Ethics and CSR Committee ensures that the ethical culture and principles applicable to management and the entire staff
are communicated within the business. As set out in section 3.4 of this Universal Registration Document, general
management supports the ethics and compliance policy with, in particular, a strong zero-tolerance anti-corruption message.

**Group Ethics Charter**

The Group has established a Group Ethics Charter. In accordance with the United Nations Global Compact, the Group Ethics
Charter describes the fundamental values which must guide every team member, whatever the circumstances, by reference
to the OECD guidelines for multinational companies.

This Charter was reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on 18 December 2018, in a more illustrative and helpful
format so as to offer a practical guide to ethics. This Charter forms the bedrock underpinning all internal policies, codes of
conduct and specific procedures adopted by Getlink (including the anti-corruption and competition policies and the
Securities Ethics Charter).

**The Directors’ Charter**

The Directors’ Charter sets out the rights and obligations of each Director, in particular with regard to conflicts of interests.
Each Director undertakes to abide by this charter and carry out their duties with independence, integrity, loyalty and
professionalism. As indicated below, the Senior Independent Director ensures that the Board and its committees abide by
governance practices and is responsible for handling any conflict of interests of executive officers and other members of the
Board: “Directors undertake, in all circumstances, to maintain their independence of analysis, judgement, decision and action
and to reject any direct or indirect pressure on them from other Directors, groups of shareholders, creditors, suppliers, and
more generally, any third party. In particular, Directors must avoid plurality of functions within companies, which directly or
indirectly compete with the company, such plurality being likely to affect the interest of the company, or its governance. […]
Directors undertake not to seek or accept from the company or the subsidiaries thereof, directly or indirectly, any advantages
likely to affect their independence.”

Conflicts of interest within the Board are managed as follows:

all Directors are under the obligation to inform the Board of any circumstances – even potential – of a conflict of interest
between themselves (or any individual or legal entity with which they have a business relationship) and Getlink SE or any
of the companies in which Getlink SE has an interest, or any company with which Getlink SE intends to enter into an
agreement of any nature whatsoever;

if a Director is unsure about the existence of a conflict of interest – even potential – he or she must immediately inform
the Chairman of the Board who will have the responsibility of deciding whether or not the Board must be informed, and
thereupon initiate the procedure for managing conflicts of interest;

if the member of the Board referred to in the previous subparagraph is in fact the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman
must inform the Senior Independent Director of the Board, or failing that, the Board itself;

the relevant Director must refrain from voting in the Board’s decision regarding the conclusion of the agreement in
question and from participating in the discussion preceding that vote; and

additionally, the Chairman of the Board, the members of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and, as the case may be,
the Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s) are under no obligation to communicate information or documents relating to the
agreement or the transaction from which the conflict of interest arose to the member or members of the Board when
they have reasonable grounds to believe that the member or members have a conflict of interest; they must inform the
Board of the information or documents being withheld.

**Securities Ethics Charter**

The Board drew up a code of conduct governing transactions in securities so as to avoid any insider trading issues. This code
was updated following the entry into effect of EU Regulation 596/2014 of 16 April 2014 on market abuse and the AMF
guidance of 26 October 2016 on permanent reporting and the management of inside information. The first part of the code,
which is now called the Securities Ethics Charter, sets out the essential ethical principles that apply and the second part sets
out the applicable preventive measures, with specific preventive measures for financial transactions. The appendix to the
code contains a description of the legal and regulatory provisions applicable, together with details of potential sanctions.
This code sets out the blackout periods for securities transactions and the exercise of options. This recommendation covers
all types of exercises of options including simple exercises, i.e. options exercised without an ensuing sale. The code defines
the following blackout periods:

a minimum of 30 calendar days prior to the publishing of the annual and half-yearly financial statements; and

a minimum of 15 calendar days prior to the publishing of the quarterly disclosures.


-----

**Non-regulated agreements**

Getlink has set up an internal control procedure for regulated and non-regulated agreements in accordance with the relevant
regulations pursuant to French law 2019-486 for the growth and transformation of companies of 22 May 2019 (the “PACTE
law”).

The agreements covered by article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code, referred to as “regulated agreements”, are
subject to a specific procedure and must be subject to prior authorisation by the Board of Directors and a special report by
the statutory auditors before being presented to the General Meeting for approval.

Agreements relating to current operations and concluded under normal conditions as well as intra-group agreements
between two companies, one of which directly or indirectly holds 100% of the capital of the other, are excluded from this
control procedure.

The internal procedure describes the following:

the parties involved and the criteria to be considered in order to qualify a current transaction and a transaction concluded
under normal conditions;

the procedure for identifying agreements, which is based on an assessment conducted by a committee composed of the
finance department, the legal department and the Getlink Board Secretariat with the support of the teams concerned
and a review at least once a year of current agreements entered into under normal terms and conditions; and

the specific procedures to be applied depending on whether the agreement is a standard agreement entered into under
normal conditions, subject to an annual review by the Board of Directors, or a regulated agreement, subject to prior
authorisation by the Board of Directors and approval by the General Meeting as well as an annual review.

**Internal Rules**

The Board has approved a set of Internal Rules to complement the laws, regulations and Articles of Association, specifying
the role and functional practices of the Board and its committees, with particular attention given to the principles of the
Afep/Medef Code. The Internal Rules are updated on a regular basis and most recently on 24 February 2021 to allow for an
Environment and Climate Lead Director to be appointed.

The Internal Rules include specific provision concerning the composition of the Board and the independence criteria applied
to its members, the duties and powers of the Board, information provided to members and the Internal Rules of each of
its committees.

The main provisions of these Internal Rules are described below.


**Role of the Board of Directors (article 1 of the Internal Rules)**

The Board of Directors has the following roles as part of its management responsibilities for Getlink SE, which it undertakes
in the best interests of the company taking into consideration the social and environmental aspects of its activity and the
framework of its legal and constitutional obligations:

be combined or separate;

-----

sets the annual performance objectives of the executive officers and determines their remuneration in accordance
with the principles defined in the Afep/Medef Code, as amended, and submits this remuneration to the General
Meeting for vote in accordance with the conditions required by law and the recommendations of the Afep/Medef
Code, as amended;

takes note of the essential characteristics of the internal control and risk management systems adopted and
implemented by general management. Specifically, the Board checks with general management that the steering
procedure and internal control and risk management systems are able to ensure the reliability of the company’s

management;

ensures that strategies and objectives are in place for the known major risks facing the company, and that these major
risks are taken into account in the company’s management;

exercises over information provided by the organisation; in this capacity, it defines the communication policy of
Getlink SE concerning the frequency of publication of financial information relating to the Group. In particular, it
approves the text of press releases announcing annual and half-yearly financial results as well as any significant event
with respect to the financial markets; and

approves regulated agreements as required by the laws and regulations in force at the relevant time.

The Internal Rules state that shareholders should be consulted when the sale of assets representing one half or more of
the company’s assets over the last two financial years is considered. This threshold is considered to have been attained
when two ratios reach or exceed half of the consolidated amount (calculated for the divesting company over the previous
two financial years). Ratios include:

revenue realised by the assets or operations sold to total consolidated revenue;

the sale price of the asset(s) sold to the stock market capitalisation of the Group;

the net carrying amount of the asset(s) sold to the total consolidated balance sheet;

the pre-tax current net result generated by the assets or operations sold to consolidated pre-tax current net result; and

the number of employees of operations sold compared to the total Group workforce.

**Members of the Board (article 2 of the Internal Rules)**

Irrespective of their specific position or competences, each Director must act in the best interest of the company.

Each Board Director must devote the time and attention necessary to fulfil their duties and participate in meetings of
the Board and of the committees of which they are a member.

The Board must be composed of members chosen for their skill and experience relevant to the business of the Group.

Members of the Board may attend training sessions on matters specific to the business, its activities or its business
sector, such training being organised by Getlink SE on its own initiative or at the request of the Board.

Each Director is required to notify the AMF and Getlink SE of any acquisition, disposal, subscription or exchange of
financial instruments issued by Getlink SE or any transaction in related financial instruments, in accordance with
applicable regulations.

The duties of Directors are as described in the Afep/Medef Code. Before accepting the position, Directors must ensure
that they are aware of the general obligations of Board members and of those specific to their role. Directors must be
aware of all relevant provisions of the governing law, the Articles of Association of Getlink SE and the Internal Rules
of the Board that apply to them.

Each Director has the obligation to disclose to the Board any actual or potential conflict of interest between them and
Getlink SE or the Group and must abstain from voting on matters considered at meetings of the Board to which the
conflict of interest relates, unless the conflict of interest arises in connection with an agreement entered into in the
ordinary course of business under normal conditions. In respect of ElecLink, the Internal Rules contain restrictions for
members who represent or have a professional activity in an electricity generation or supply company.

The number of additional appointments held by members of the Board in listed companies outside the Group is
limited to two additional appointments in listed companies outside the Group for executive officers and to four
additional appointments in listed companies outside the Group for other Directors. This includes any appointments
held in foreign listed companies. Board members must inform the Board of any new appointment. The limit is assessed
on each appointment or re-appointment. In accordance with recommendation 19.2 of the Afep/Medef Code, executive
officers must receive prior advice from the Board before accepting another appointment in a listed company.

Board members must all contribute towards determining the business strategy of the Group and overseeing the

members of the Board on any matter pertaining to the Group, whether or not related to meetings of the Board, without
the prior consent of the Chairman.

Every Board Director must comply with all market regulations intended to prevent market abuse that would be harmful
to the interests and reputation of the Group.

Executive Officer all useful information in order to coordinate the work of the Board and its committees.

he manages all potential conflicts of interest as set out in the Directors’ Charter.

Specific responsibilities

If the Chairman of the Board is not in charge of general management, he is entrusted by these Internal Rules with the
following specific duties in addition to the general powers provided for by law and in close collaboration with the Chief
Executive Officer. The Chairman of the Board is given a special mandate for the purpose of:

representing the Group in its high-level relations, leading or participating in any discussion between the company and
its stakeholders, its high-level relations, particularly with public authorities, financial institutions, and/or major
commercial partners, both nationally and internationally;

representing the Board of Directors in its relations with major shareholders and institutional investors outside meetings
of the General Meeting (which he chairs), in coordination with the Chief Executive Officer, who retains responsibility

Independent Director if the Board has decided to appoint one of its members to this function in accordance with
article 6;

assuming a role in driving strategy in close coordination with the Chief Executive Officer, involving, in particular,

Executive Officer on any significant event affecting strategy and to be invited to certain internal executive meetings;

providing support to general management on issues affecting the balance and cohesion between the French and
British components of the Group and its teams.

In all these specific duties, the Chairman acts in close coordination with the Chief Executive Officer, who alone is
responsible for the direction and operational management of the company. He ensures that a close and trusting
relationship is maintained with general management and provides it with assistance and advice while respecting its
executive duties. The Chairman’s duties are contributory in nature and do not confer any executive powers on him.

Information

The Chairman ensures that the information provided to the Directors enables them to make informed decisions and, when
he is not in charge of general management, he ensures that the Chief Executive Officer communicates the documents and
information necessary for the Directors to be able to perform their duties. The Chief Executive Officer keeps the Board
regularly informed of significant events and situations relating to the life of the Group and the Board may ask him for any
information that may enlighten the Board and its Committees. He may meet with the statutory auditors in order to prepare
the work of the Board. The Chairman of the Board is kept informed by the Chief Executive Officer of significant events and
situations, in particular urgent situations relating to the life of the Group, so that the Chairman may inform the Board. He
may ask the Chief Executive Officer for any information likely to be useful to the Board.

The Chairman of the Board’s duties include ensuring that the Board is informed of any issue relating to compliance with
the principles of corporate social and environmental responsibility, market trends, the competitive environment and the
main challenges (regulatory issues, when applicable), and that the Chief Executive Officer communicates in a timely
manner any information that he deems relevant in this respect; the Chairman of the Board ensures that shareholders’
rights are respected when General Meetings are being organised.

**Chief Executive Officer (article 3)**

The Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the company
subject to the restrictions resulting from the obligation to submit decisions relating to the significant transactions referred
to in article 1 of these Internal Rules to the Board for prior approval.

The following transactions are considered to be significant (non-exhaustive list):

any acquisition and disposal of assets or equity interests, investment or divestment, creation, acquisition or disposal
of any subsidiary or equity interest, or internal restructuring, when the total of such investment exceeds €20 million;

to the extent compatible with the contracts and commitments in force at the relevant time, any borrowing of an
amount in excess of €10 million, as well as any refinancing or voluntary repayment of any indebtedness;

any transaction having an impact on equity, where the amounts involved exceed €10 million;

in the event of a dispute, the conclusion of all treaties or transactions, or the acceptance of all compromises, when the
amounts involved exceed €10 million;

the granting of any security interest in the company’s assets.

When such transactions, decisions or commitments give rise to successive payments linked to the achievement of results
or objectives to the third party or parties involved in the contract, the limits are assessed by adding these different
payments together. The prior approval procedure is not applicable to intra-group transactions and decisions that will give
rise to the conclusion of agreements exclusively involving subsidiaries and the company itself.

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the appointment of senior management; however, he will inform the Board
of the identity, skills and experience of the selected candidates before appointing the main operational managers and
heads of functions.

**Board proceedings, videoconferencing or teleconferencing (article 4 of the Internal Rules)**

The Internal Rules of the Board state that Directors may participate in meetings by all means authorised by law and the
Articles of Association, including videoconferencing or teleconferencing as long as such videoconferencing or
teleconferencing facilities (i) enable the transmission of at least the voices of the participants and (ii) satisfy technical
requirements enabling the continuous and simultaneous transmission of the proceedings.

The General Meeting of 30 April 2020 voted to harmonise of article 20 of the Articles of Association with French law 2019744 dated 19 July 2019 to enable decisions falling within the Board’s own remit to be taken by written consultation of the
directors.


-----

**Information for Board members (article 5 of the Internal Rules)**

The Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer gives each Director the documents and information needed to carry out their
duties, subject to the confidentiality obligations described in the Internal Rules.

**Committees (article 6 of the Internal Rules)**

The Board may establish temporary or permanent specialised committees consisting of members appointed by the Board,
with one committee member designated by the Board as the committee chairman.

The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination and Remuneration Committee, a Safety and Security
Committee, an Ethics and CSR Committee and an Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee.

**Independent Directors**

At least half of the Directors must be independent within the scope of and in accordance with the criteria set out in
recommendation 9.5 of the Afep/Medef Code.

The criteria for Directors to be viewed as independent are the following:

not to be nor have been during the course of the previous five years:

   - an employee or chief executive officer of Getlink SE;

   - an employee, chief executive officer of a company or a director of a company consolidated within Getlink SE;

   - an employee, chief executive officer or a director of the company’s parent company or a company consolidated
within this parent;

not to be nor have been during the previous five years an executive corporate officer of a company in which Getlink SE
holds, either directly or indirectly, a directorship or in which an employee appointed as such or an executive corporate
officer of the company (currently in office or having held such office for less than five years) is a director;

not to be a customer, supplier, investment banker, commercial banker nor advisor:

   - that is material to Getlink SE or the Group,

   - or for whom Getlink SE or the Group represent a significant part of their business.

The evaluation of how significant the relationship is with Getlink SE or the Group must be debated by the Board
and the quantitative and qualitative criteria that led to this assessment (continuity, economic dependence,
exclusivity, etc) are described in the corporate governance report. The Board of Directors assesses the significance
of the business relationship with the company. The significance or not of a business relationship is not only
considered in terms of quantitative criteria. The Board also considers other parameters when determining whether
such a relationship is material and free of major conflict.

   - not to be related by close family ties to a corporate officer;

   - not to have been an auditor of the company within the previous five years;

   - not to have been a Director of Getlink SE for more than 12 years.

Board members representing substantial shareholders of the company may be considered independent so long as such
shareholders do not participate in the control of the company. However, where the interest of the shareholder in question
exceeds 10% of the share capital or voting rights, the Board must consider the matter of the Director’s independence, on
the basis of a report from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, taking into account the structure of the capital
of the company and the existence of potential conflicts of interest.

Independent Directors who have served more than 12 years as a Director of Getlink SE shall no longer be considered
independent and shall resign from office as a Directors of Getlink SE no later than 12 months afterwards.

Directors who have reached the age of 80 shall resign from office no later than 12 months after their 80th birthday.


**Board members who satisfy the independence criteria**

The Board is required to verify at least once a year that Directors satisfy the independence criteria set out above. The
independence of the two staff representative directors is not assessed, in accordance with the recommendations set out in
the Afep/Medef Code.

After consideration of their individual position by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board considered that
on 24 February 2021 the following Directors met the independence criteria set out in the Afep/Medef Code: Patricia Hewitt,
Perrette Rey, Peter Levene, Colette Lewiner, Corinne Bach, Bertrand Badré, Sharon Flood, Jean-Marc Janaillac as well as
Jean-Pierre Trotignon.


-----

Jacques Gounon in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until 30 June 2020, is not considered to be an
independent Director nor are Elisabetta De Bernardi di Valserra nor Carlo Bertazzo who represent Atlantia which controls
Aero I Global & International S.à.r.l., Getlink SE’s principal shareholder.

Tim Yeo reached 12 years of service as a director of Getlink SE in 2020 so is no longer be considered as independent. In
order to preserve the level of independence of the Board of Directors and in line with the Board renewal plan, Tim Yeo has
agreed to retire from the Board of Getlink SE. This decision will take effect at the end of the General Meeting to be held on
28 April 2021.

The Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, has assured itself that there are no
significant business relationships between Group companies, and other companies outside the Group in which independent
Board members of Getlink SE are also appointed as a director.

The Board referred to a table summarising fund flows (purchases and sales) during the last financial year, between Group
companies and Group companies of which independent Directors of the company are also board members.

These fund flows are considered in relation to the total weight of purchases and sales, for each group, to measure their
significance. For 2020, this table shows that the sum of sales of Group companies, to any one of the groups concerned, or
of its purchases from any one of those groups, does not exceed 0.35% of the total sales or purchases of Group companies
or of any one of the groups concerned, with the exception of two suppliers, EDF and Colas, of which Colette Lewiner is
a director.

Firstly, the Board noted and confirmed the practice of initiating calls for tender. The Board carried out a qualitative analysis
of the parameters used to determine whether or not such a relationship is material and if it is exempt from conflicts of
interest, including but not limited to:

the length and continuity (precedence, history, renewals);

the importance or the “intensity” of the relationship (possible economic dependency; exclusive relations or predominance
in the sector in which the business relationship is established; distribution of bargaining power, etc);

the organisation of the relationship: Colette Lewiner is not a member of the Board of the contracting companies (FM,
CTG, Europorte) and holds no direct decision-making power over the contracts and agreements constituting the business
relationship; Colette Lewiner has received no remuneration associated with the contract, link or business relationship that
may exist with EDF and Colas.

Thus, the Board on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, confirmed the absence of any
significant business relationship in 2020.

The following table sets out the position of each Director in relation to the independence criteria referred to in the
Afep/Medef Corporate Governance Code:

**Environment and Climate Lead Director**

In order to support the organisation to move towards a lower carbon economy, the Board of Directors of Getlink SE has
instituted the possibility of appointing an Environment and Climate Lead Director.

The role of the Environment and Climate Lead Director is to ensure that the Board of Directors is able to make informed
decisions on a just transition and encourage a long-term transformational approach to climate change issues.


-----

The Environment and Climate Lead Director will be able to monitor transparently the company's progress in relation to the
transition programme decided by the Board of Directors. To this end, the Environment and Climate Lead Director may, in
particular:

ensure that the Board of Directors is fully informed of the progress of the workstreams in accordance with the defined
trajectory and in relation to crucial milestones, to enable the company to prepare itself on different time scales;

provide regular, cross-functional updates on science, innovation, peer initiatives and regulations to the Ethics and CSR
Committee;

invite experts, in the Ethics and CSR Committee or in the full meeting of the Board of Directors, to discuss specific issues,
to strengthen collective knowledge; and

consider the creation of an independent stakeholder panel to inform Board decisions.

The Board of Directors has appointed the Chairman of the Ethics and CSR Committee as the Environment and Climate Lead
Director.

**Senior Independent Director**

The Internal Rules of the Board allow for the appointment of a Senior Independent Director who must be independent as
defined by the Afep/Medef Code. The Senior Independent Director is appointed for the duration of his/her term of office
as Director.

The Senior Independent Director has the following duties:

monitor and manage any potential conflict of interest situations that may arise for the executive officers and other
Directors;

suggest additional agenda items to the Chairman for meetings of the Board, as required;

ensure that the Board and committees adopt good governance; and

manage the annual assessment of the Board on the basis of an anonymous detailed questionnaire on the roles and
competence of the Board, its functioning as a whole and the areas dealt with by the Board and its committees.

In order to preserve his/her independence, the Senior Independent Director is not remunerated for this role.

Colette Neuville was Getlink SE’s Senior Independent Director until the end of her term of office as a Director on 30 April
2020.

Taking into account the separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, no Senior Independent Director has
been appointed following the departure of Colette Neuville.

**Staff representative Director(s)**

In accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-27 of the French Commercial Code, the shareholders’ General Meeting
held on 18 April 2018 amended the company’s Articles of Association to approve the formalities for the appointment of the
requisite number of staff representative director(s) as required by law and the appointment was made in the six months
following approval of the amendment of the Articles of Association.

The General Meeting held on 30 April 2020 voted to harmonise articles 15, 16 and 17 of the Articles of Association relating
to members of the Board in order to reflect the new wording of article L. 225-45 arising from French law 2019-486 dated
22 May 2019 relating to the growth and transformation of businesses, the so-called “PACTE law” and to supplement these
arrangements with the possibility of making optional appointments. In this case, one of these Directors will be appointed, in
accordance with article L. 225-27-1 of the French Commercial Code, in accordance with the procedures provided for in
paragraph III-2° of said article, namely appointment by the Group Committee, and the other or others in accordance with
the procedures provided for in paragraph III-4° of the same article, namely by the committee of the company that has the
status of a European Company, referred to as the "European company committee".

The staff representative Directors have the same status, rights and responsibilities as the other Directors.

- Term expired during the 2020 financial year.

The significant number of meetings and high attendance rate of Directors throughout the year should be noted. This
frequency of meetings and attendance rate are the first objective factor which this year more than ever offer assurance that
the Board is in a position to fulfil its role especially in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.

**Recurring topics**

In 2020, in addition to financial and legal authorisations, the Board placed its focus mainly on issues of strategy, the accounts
and corporate and business governance.

At each of its meetings, the Board discussed the progress of the business, took note of share activity and relative
performance, monitored cash flow and reviewed data trends concerning attempted intrusion within the perimeter of the
Concession.

During the 2020 financial year, the Board finalised the financial statements as at 31 December 2019 and prepared the
half-year financial statements for the six-months ended 30 June 2020. Through these presentations and the monthly reports
to the Board, the Board was kept informed of the financial situation and the cash position. The presentation of the financial
department also covered risks and material off-balance sheet commitments and highlighted the key points arising from the
statutory audit and the accounting options adopted.

The Board also considered the five-year plan and the budget for 2021 for all activities. The Board also carried out a review
of the Group risk map, as well as the activity of the internal audit function.

The Board also made preparations for the 2020 Combined General Meeting and, in particular, drew up the draft resolutions.
The Board decided to renew the share buyback programme. It conducted the annual review of the regulated agreements.

Regarding corporate governance, during 2020 the Board approved the corporate governance report. The Board discussed
the formal assessment of its functioning and that of its committees undertaken by the Senior Independent Director and
based on a formal meeting guide. The Board determined the variable remuneration for 2019 of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration
Committee and set the targets that would determine the variable portion of the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for 2020. When assessing the performance of the executive officers,
the external Board members meet without the internal Board members being present. The Board also examined governance
issues, in particular regarding its own composition in the light of the recommendations of the Afep/Medef Code, particularly
with regard to the diversity of profiles.


-----

The Board of Directors considered the company’s policy on professional and salary equality between women and men, on
the basis of indicators relating in particular to the gender pay gap, the plan for professional equality between women and
men and on a more balanced representation of women and men in management bodies.

The Senior Independent Director, until the end of her term of office on 30 April 2020, assisted in establishing the practice of
holding meetings of members of the Board without executive officers or internal executives present (executive sessions).
Since then, each board meeting includes a session devoted to the work of the various committees. These "executive sessions"
(when these sessions are held without the presence of the executive directors) are organised, in particular, on the subjects
of governance or remuneration. In addition, Getlink SE opted for an electronic management solution for Board documents
and the dematerialisation of meetings, which provides directors with access to discussion tools, collaborative documents
and the possibility of sharing their comments, thereby optimising collaboration between directors without internal directors
being present.

The Board is kept informed throughout the year of major issues, with a particular focus in 2020 on Covid-19 and Brexit.

During the annual seminar, Board members undertook a detailed strategic analysis of the Group’s competitive environment.
It heard and debated presentations on the Group’s financial, strategic, employee and regulatory position and the results of
actions taken.

**Specific topics**

The Getlink Board of Directors met at short notice during the Covid-19 public health crisis to consider general management’s
action plans in response to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic with the objectives of protecting employees and customers
through adjusted work organisation, resilience and flexibility of service and taking the necessary measures to maintain
financial flexibility and honour its commitments.

The Board of Directors decided to instigate short-time working. As a gesture of solidarity, the company's management,
executive officers and Directors waived part of their remuneration. As a matter of prudence and in view of the general trend,
the Getlink Board of Directors decided not to propose the payment in 2020 of the dividend for the 2019 financial year at its
annual General Meeting.

The Board of Directors agreed the formalities for the General Meeting to be held on 30 April 2020 and decided that it would
be held on an exceptional basis without the shareholders and other persons entitled to attend being physically present, i.e.
behind closed doors, in accordance with Order no. 2020-321 of 25 March 2020.

In October 2020, the Board of Directors worked on securing the financial covenants and decided to issue new 2025 Green
Bonds to a value of €700 million at an annual rate of 3.5% in order to refinance the 2023 Green Bonds then in circulation.

During 2020, the Board monitored the progress of the ElecLink interconnector project.

The Board of Directors has endeavoured to put in place a balanced and appropriate governance structure, capable of dealing
with the circumstances and challenges of the Group. In 2020, the Board of Directors proceeded to separate the roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board removed the role of Deputy Chief Executive Officer by application of article
L. 225-55, sub-paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code and continued its work to harmonise the rotation of members
on the basis of the plan to stagger the terms of office of directors as presented to the General Meeting. The Board of
Directors was kept informed of the work of the Nominations Committee at each meeting and each stage of the process was
submitted to the Board. The Board of Directors also discussed, in the specific geopolitical context of Brexit, the possibility of
proposing an amendment to the Articles of Association at the General Meeting to allow the appointment of a director
representing British employees.

In the light of Euronext’s announcement of the closure of its regulated market in London, the Board of Directors decided to
apply to the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for a delisting application so as to terminate the secondary listing of
Getlink's ordinary shares on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange and this took effect on 26 June 2020.

The Board met twice between the beginning of this year and 24 February 2021, the date on which the Board approved
the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020. The average attendance rate was 100%.

These meetings dealt with the review of strategic, financial, operational and non-financial risks and their ranking, the work
on the consolidated and parent company financial statements at 31 December 2020, the management report, the nonfinancial performance statement and the governance report drawn up pursuant to the provisions of article L. 225-37 of the
French Commercial Code, the Board’s reports to the General Meeting and with the Board assessment, as well as determining
the variable annual remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Executive Officer for the 2020
financial year, the remuneration policy and the remuneration criteria for executive officers for 2021.


-----

In accordance with the Gender Equality Charter, the Board oversaw the workstreams arising out of the action plan for
professional equality i.e. a more balanced representation of men and women within the governing bodies. On the
recommendation of the Ethics and CSR Committee, it set Getlink's objectives in this area. The proportion of women on the
Executive Committee is one third. The Board of Directors, after having considered the action plan aimed at increasing the
number of women in the company and in the management bodies, has set a target for the end of 2023 of more than 40%
of women on the Executive Committee, a rate of 25% of women in the first three levels of the hierarchy, and a proportion of
women in management set at 30%. The means associated with these targets, including the recruitment of at least 40% of
each gender, are set out in section 6.1.3 of this Universal Registration Document.

With the support of the Ethics and CSR Committee, the Board of Directors took a proactive approach to reducing the carbon
footprint of its activities and monitored the work of the teams with a view to a strategy to reduce the business's greenhouse
gas emissions and, on this basis, was able to set an interim target for 2023. The Board of Directors decided to appoint an
Environment and Climate Lead Director. By doing so, the Board of Directors is demonstrating its ambition to support the
company, in particular towards a more carbon-efficient economy. The Board of Directors approved the change of name and
status of the Corporate Committee, which became the Ethics and CSR Committee, and approved the update of the Internal
Rules.

The Board agreed the agenda for the General Meeting to be held on 30 April 2021. The Board considered the information
presented to shareholders in this Universal Registration Document to enable shareholders to evaluate the management of
the company and its Board and strategy.

**c)** **Committees of the Board of Directors**

The Board delegates to the special committees the task of preparing and submitting information on specific topics for the
Board’s approval. Five committees investigate matters that fall within their field of responsibility, and submit their opinions
and recommendations to the Board namely: the Audit Committee; the Nomination and Remuneration Committee; the Safety
and Security Committee; the Ethics and CSR Committee and the Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee, all of whose
terms of reference are governed by the Internal Rules of the Board and its committees.

**Audit Committee**


Composition and duties set out in the Internal Rules


The Audit Committee is composed of at least three members chosen from among the Directors other than the Chief
Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board, including at least two independent Directors. The Board appoints one of the
members as chairman of the Audit Committee. At least one member of the Audit Committee must have “specific expertise
in finance or accounting matters” and be “independent” and the other members of the Audit Committee must be
competent in financial and accounting matters even if they are not experts in the matter.

The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year when meetings are called by its Chair.

The duties of the Audit Committee are to:

Monitor the process of preparation of the financial and accounting information; before presentation to the Board, the
Audit Committee examines the consolidated and parent company financial statements, together with budgets and
forecasts; it reviews the accounting and financial information, particularly the financial statements, checking that
important events or complex transactions have been properly accounted for.

The Audit Committee is informed of the architecture of all systems for establishing accounting and financial
information; when financial information is taken from an accounting process, it must be coherent with the accounting
information that is produced; if it is not taken from an accounting process, the Audit Committee must make sure that
the information comes from a process that is sufficiently structured and organised to be able to judge the quality and
reliability of this information.

Ensure the statutory audit of the financial statements by the statutory auditors. The Audit Committee holds discussions
with the statutory auditors and examines their conclusions, to learn the main areas of risk or uncertainty concerning
the annual or consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee examines the main factors having an impact on
the audit approach (scope of consolidation, acquisition and disposal transactions, accounting options, new standards
applied, large transactions and so on) and significant risks relating to the preparation and processing of the financial
and accounting information identified by the statutory auditors.

Monitor the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems: the Audit Committee checks the existence
of internal control and risk management systems, and that they are made use of, and makes sure that the weaknesses
identified are dealt with by corrective action. When monitoring the efficiency of the internal control and risk
management systems and, where appropriate, internal audit, with respect to the procedures relating to the
preparation and processing of accounting and financial information, the Committee meets with the internal audit and
risk control managers and issues an opinion on the organisation of their departments. It is informed of the internal
audit programme and receives the internal audit reports or a periodic summary of these reports.

The Committee examines material risks and off-balance sheet commitments, assesses the importance of failures or
weaknesses communicated to it and informs the Board, where appropriate.

Ensure that the independence of the statutory auditors is monitored: the Committee is in charge of steering the
selection and re-appointment of the statutory auditors using a call-for-tenders procedure if the case arises, issuing an
opinion on the amount of fees requested by them and issuing a recommendation on the statutory auditors proposed
for appointment by the General Meeting.

To propose a financial communication policy to the Board of Directors.

Preparing the Board of Directors' budget discussions.

During the accounts closing preparation process, the Audit Committee meets with the statutory auditors and is presented
with the accounts by the finance department. More detailed presentations are given by other managers or external
consultants on certain subjects, including internal control and risk management.

**During 2020, the Audit Committee examined the parent company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended**
31 December 2019 and the draft 2020 interim financial statements before they were presented to the Board, and expressed
its opinion on these draft financial statements to the Board. As part of this work, the Audit Committee examined the
accounting treatment of material transactions during the period, accounting methods, the accounting treatment of
refinancing transactions, the scope of consolidation and the main items of financial reporting relating to the financial
statements. It also examined material off-balance sheet commitments. It met with the internal audit director and considered
the internal audit plan for 2020. The internal audit director also reported to the Audit Committee on the activities of the
internal audit department during the first half of 2020.

The Audit Committee reviewed in 2020 the procedures for identifying, monitoring and managing risks and internal control,
reviewed the risks and analysed the risk map, and examined significant financial and operational risks. It reported to the
Board on its work.

As a consequence of the Covid-19 crisis, the 2020 half-yearly financial statements required more in-depth work and even
greater diligence on the part of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviewed the impact of the Covid-19 health crisis
on the major risks and uncertainties identified and considered the risks induced by the pandemic risk.

The Audit Committee examined the proposed refinancing of the 2023 Green Bonds and the accounting treatment of that
operation. The Audit Committee considered the various budget projections and monitoring established during the public
health crisis, as well as projects aimed at securing covenants.

The Audit Committee sought external technical research.

The Audit Committee met three times between the beginning of this year and 24 February 2021. The attendance rate of
its members was 100%. These meetings focused on the draft consolidated and parent company financial statements at
31 December 2020, the accounting treatment of material transactions during the year and accounting methods. The Audit
Committee reviewed the regulated agreements, the list of all current agreements entered into under normal conditions and
the criteria for the assessment of those agreements. The strategy of the statutory auditors and their approach to the audit
of the parent company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 was presented to the
Audit Committee, which considered the subjects covered by the audit plan, the scope of the statutory auditors’ work, the
impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the audit strategy and the major elements specific to the year in question. The statutory
auditors also presented their review of internal control in the context of the audit of the 2020 accounts to the Audit
Committee.

The Audit Committee’s meeting to examine the accounts, in advance of the Board doing so, took place on 18 February 2021,
i.e. seven days before the Board meeting.

The Audit Committee considered the Group's challenges and ambitions, as reviewed at meetings of the Board of Directors,
and the main action plans implemented to achieve these ambitions and their financial translation.

In 2020 (between 1 January and 30 April 2020), the work of the Remuneration Committee was carried out in close
collaboration with the Nominations Committee. It focused on the remuneration proposed for the executive officers against
the background of the separation of the roles and in line with the organisation’s practices as well as market practices and
having particular regard to the transition phase. The Committee worked on a 2020 plan to align the interests of employees
and executives with the performance of the business, including the grant of free ordinary shares to all employees of
Getlink SE and its subsidiaries, (with the exception of executive officers) and the grant to senior management and executives
of performance shares. The Committee considered the organisation’s policy on professional and pay gender equality and
considered the actions envisaged in the Group, as an extension of the charter project relating to professional equality. The
meetings of the Committed focused on the report on the principles and rules used to determine the remuneration and
benefits of any kind granted to the executive officers, the determination of the amount of variable remuneration for the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for 2020, and set the remuneration policy and
the criteria for determining the variable remuneration for 2020 for the executive officers.

was 100%.

Nomination and Remuneration Committee meeting attendance in 2020 (1 May to 31 December 2020)

**Committee meetings** **Number of meetings** **Attendance**

Perrette Rey (chairwoman) 2 2 100%

Peter Levene 2 2 100%

At these meetings, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee prepared the implementation of the 2020 LTI plan on
behalf of the Board of Directors. The Committee met to continue its work on preparing the future composition of the
company's governing bodies as part of the succession plan and, in particular, to prepare the succession of Giancarlo Guenzi
and meet Carlo Bertazzo.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee met three times between the start of the year and 24 February 2021. The
attendance rate was 100%. These meetings focused on the report on the principles and rules used to determine the
remuneration and benefits of any kind granted to the executive officers, the determination of the amount of variable
remuneration for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the first half of 2020 and for the Chief Executive Officer for
the second half of 2020 and set the remuneration policy and the criteria for determining the variable remuneration for the
executive officers. The Committee worked on the consequences of the absence of a 2020 target and the material impossibility
of assessing the performance of executives and LTI beneficiaries under that criterion. The Committee considered a 2021 plan
to align the interests of employees and executives with the performance of the business, including the grant of free ordinary
shares to all employees of Getlink SE and its subsidiaries (with the exception of senior executives) and the grant to senior
executives and management of performance shares. In conjunction with the work of the Ethics and CSR Committee and to
ensure the engagement of the people concerned and enable the company to progress and achieve its objectives, the
Nomination and Remuneration Committee has decided to propose to the Board of Directors that the 2021 performance
action plan be included in the cycle of the environment and climate plan and that it be subject to performance criteria to be
met over a three-year period, in line with the 2023 CSR objectives. The Committee decided to propose to the Board of
Directors that the CSR criteria usually used in the long-term incentive plans be altered so as to align Getlink's social, societal
and environmental ambitions for 2023.

The Committee considered the organisation’s policy on professional and pay gender equality and considered the actions
envisaged in the Group, as an extension of the charter project relating to professional equality.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee sought external technical research.

**Safety and Security Committee**


Composition and duties set out in the Internal Rules


The Safety and Security Committee reviews all matters concerning safety and security within the company or the Group
and reports to the Board.

The remit of the Safety and Security Committee is to:

regularly examine all matters concerning the safety or security of (i) the operation of the transport System, including
the services of the national railways during their crossing of the Tunnel, and, separately, (ii) the activities of the railway
subsidiaries. This review includes issues that may have a significant impact on the environmental performance of the
company and the Group;

review reports on any incidents or accidents and ensure that appropriate action has been taken, or appropriate
recommendations have been applied by the national railways;

regularly review response procedures and the application of recommendations made to prevent the recurrence of
similar events;

receive reports of any incidents or accidents occurring in other transportation systems or in other industries that are
similar to the company’s or the Group’s system and to recommend appropriate action;

receive reports on the safety consequences of any major changes in the transport System procedures or design, and
to provide advice, if necessary, in the context of submissions to the Safety Authority of the IGC;

more generally, take, within the scope of its powers, any initiative to be presented to the Board aimed at improving
the current levels of performance of the business, in particular by updating the risk prevention and management
strategies;

ensure, with regard to occupational health and safety, that any person affected by the safety implications of an
operating procedure or a change in such a procedure must be able to make his or her opinion known; and

to report regularly to the Board of Directors.

Composition

The Safety and Security Committee is composed of a maximum of six directors appointed by the Board, including the
Chairman of the company. Other officers and executives may be invited to participate in the Safety and Security
Committee depending on the agenda.

Meetings

The Safety and Security Committee meets at the invitation of its Chairman to discuss matters relating to the Tunnel at
least once a quarter and separately in a more restricted format to discuss rail freight matters once every six months.


Composition, duties and proceedings in 2020

At 24 February 2021, the Safety and Security Committee is composed of
Jean-Pierre Trotignon (Chairman), Jacques Gounon, Patricia Hewitt, Jean-Marc
Janaillac as well as the two staff representative directors, Stéphane Sauvage
and Philippe Vanderbec. This Committee is tasked with monitoring safety and
security issues within each sector of activity of the Group. The main
operational managers attend each of the Committee meetings relating to their
area of the business.

In respect of Eurotunnel, the Committee monitors individual and collective safety and performance indicators for the
corresponding action plans. The Committee also monitors workplace accident indicators for Fixed Link employees and subcontractors present on the site; it supports measures launched to improve results in this area and, in particular, those aimed
at developing a safety culture within the organisation.

Just as in previous years, rail safety issues including changes in the Truck Shuttle superstructures, the renovation of Passenger
Shuttles and track maintenance were regularly monitored. New topics that are important for the future were discussed, such
as the transport of batteries in trucks and actual and potential transport of electric, LNG and hydrogen vehicles. Questions
of security (prevention of clandestine attempts to cross the Channel and illegal intrusions onto the Coquelles site,
coordination with government authorities to strengthen controls and above all the business’s preparations for the
consequences of Brexit) remain an important concern for the Committee. Increased attention was paid to cyber security and
it remains an important topic for the Committee.

The Committee continued to monitor the discussions with the IGC on questions relating to the safety of the ElecLink project
and its interface with the Concession, both during the works phase and during the future operation of the cable.

The Committee also met twice to consider Europorte matters: it monitors the safety indicators and the employee training
and awareness actions implemented. The Committee also analyses the key incidents affecting operations and considers
corrective measures.

In this very unusual year, the Committee was attentive to the measures taken in each of the Group's business sectors to deal
with the Covid-19 pandemic by protecting staff and customers; a special meeting was organised at the end of March 2020
on this subject.


-----

Lastly, the committee held a joint risk review meeting with the Audit Committee at the end of the 2020 financial year.

In 2020, the Committee met five times on matters relating to the Concession and ElecLink, with an attendance rate of 100%.

The Committee held one meeting between the beginning of the year and 24 February 2021, ahead of the start of the
installation of the ElecLink cable in the Tunnel.

**Ethics and CSR Committee**

This Committee, which was previously called the Corporate Committee, wished to adopt a more self-explanatory name for
external stakeholders so it has been renamed the Ethics and CSR Committee. This change clarifies the role of this Committee
and at the same time highlights the increasing willingness of the Board of Directors to work on an overall policy approach
to CSR, which sets it apart strategically and which is anchored in the company's ethics.


Composition and duties set out in the Internal Rules


The Ethics and CSR Committee considers all questions concerning governance and the strategic and environmental
orientation of the company and the Group and reports on such questions to the Board.

The Getlink Ethics and CSR Committee’s overall purpose is to assist the Board of Directors in monitoring corporate social
responsibility (CSR) and ethical issues, so that Getlink can best anticipate the opportunities, challenges and risks associated
with them. The Ethics and CSR Committee reports to the Board of Directors on the performance of its duties and makes
recommendations on Getlink's CSR and ethics policy and achievements.

The purpose of the Ethics and CSR Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in ensuring that the Group best anticipates
the non-financial challenges, opportunities and risks associated with its business, in order to promote responsible and
harmonious long-term value creation. The Committee will issue recommendations on the Group's policy and
achievements in this area. The Committee shall pay particular attention to the principles of action, policies and practices
implemented by Getlink in the following areas: social, (in relation to the employees of Getlink and its subsidiaries);
environmental, (relating to Getlink's direct activities, those of its subsidiaries); societal and ethical.

More specifically, the Committee's mission is to ensure that CSR issues are taken into account in the definition of Getlink's
strategy, to examine CSR opportunities and risks related to Getlink's activities, to review policies in these areas, as well as
the objectives set and results achieved, more specifically in terms of investment, to ensure that merger/acquisition
processes integrate the performance of CSR due diligence, ensure that non-financial reporting, evaluation and control
systems are in place to enable Getlink to produce reliable non-financial information, review the non-financial information
published by Getlink in its annual report, review and monitor the ratings obtained from non-financial agencies, and review
the monitoring and implementation of applicable regulations in these areas.

In this perspective, the Committee examines all issues concerning governance and strategic orientations.

In its environmental role, this Committee is responsible for regularly considering the performance of the company and
the Group in environmental matters and receiving assurance regarding the Group’s environmental and climate actions
and strategic orientations designed to promote good environmental management, preserve natural resources and limit
the impact of the company’s and the Group’s activities on the environment.

In its ethics role, the Committee ensures the oversight of the ethics system. Its missions mainly consist of:

Ensuring that a framework for the ethics system and associated procedures is put in place;

Ensuring that actions are taken to promote the presentation, understanding and implementation of the Group's ethics
system, particularly in the area of the fight against corruption;

Ensuring that a network of ethics leads is set up within the Group;

Ensuring that the operating entities conduct training and awareness-raising initiatives.

In its governance role, the Committee's tasks include developing and recommending to the Board of Directors the
corporate governance principles applicable to the company and monitoring their implementation.


Composition, duties and proceedings in 2020

At 24 February 2021, the Ethics and CSR Committee is composed of Tim Yeo
(Chairman), Patricia Hewitt, Colette Lewiner, Perrette Rey, Peter Levene, JeanPierre Trotignon and Jacques Gounon. The Committee brings together the
members of the former Strategy Committee and the Chairs of the different
Board committees to enable each of the Chairs to take account of information
received and Committee discussions in organising the work of their own
committees.


-----

The Committee met twice in 2020, with an attendance rate of 89%. The Committee considered investor comments and
observations received during the governance roadshows and the resulting items to be included in the work of the different
Board committees. The Committee analysed the approach to CSR policy, the gender equality action plan, the choice of selfassessment method for the Board of Directors in 2020, the deployment and operation of the anti-corruption arrangements,
the Universal Registration Document, the London listing, the Internal Charter relating to the qualification of a convention
and the evaluation of free conventions. The Committee monitored the company's work to raise its environmental ambitions,
so that the service provided to customers and the integration of new innovations make a tangible contribution to reducing
its environmental impact. The Committee monitored the actions undertaken in 2020, the approach and criteria adopted, the
lessons learned from the Scope 3 emissions study, the detailed sources of the Group's emissions and the main contributors
to emissions.

The Committee met once between the start of this year and 24 February 2021 in order to consider the organisation’s
work on the CSR policy, the gender equality action plan, progress in the preparation of the environment and climate strategy,
and the definition of intermediate objectives for 2023, the draft Non-Financial Performance Statement, as well as the project
to appoint an Environment and Climate Lead Director.

**Economic Regulations Monitoring Committee**

The rail transport and electricity distribution sectors have undergone a number of major reorganisations initiated directly by
the public authorities and a range of economic regulatory measures have been implemented to control these activities:

The organisation of the electricity transport sector has been substantially modified to guarantee all market players the
same access conditions to essential infrastructures, necessitating the independence of transport network managers.

The number of regulatory authorities has increased: the French transport regulatory authority (ART), the French Energy
Regulatory Commission (CRE), the French financial markets regulator (AMF), competition authorities (DGCCRF). ART and
the UK Office of Rail & Road (ORR) signed an agreement providing for cooperation based on reciprocity and
transparency, in order to define guidelines for coordinated and efficient cooperation between the two authorities in the
economic regulation of the Tunnel.

In the face of these developments and without prejudice to the Group’s administrative and management bodies, the Board
of Directors decided to form a committee tasked with monitoring these economic regulations.


Composition and duties set out in the Internal Rules


The Committee is responsible for monitoring:

the efficiency of internal control systems monitoring the proper application of segregation of duty principles and other
measures set out in the economic regulations;

relations with the supervisory authorities and regulators;

approval/certification/licence processes and related retention processes;

economic regulation monitoring processes implemented in the Group.

The duties of the Committee do not involve the day-to-day monitoring of activities, as Committee members necessarily
have only a limited amount of time and resources. The Committee’s monitoring role requires members to take a step
back using summary information, to gain an adequate understanding of the procedures implemented and the main results
of controls performed. It reports to the Board of Directors on the exercise of its duties and informs it of any difficulties
encountered.


Composition, duties and proceedings in 2020

The Committee has a maximum of five members. Meetings are convened by the Chairman/Chairwoman. The Board of
Directors has appointed Patricia Hewitt (Chairwoman), Corinne Bach, Jean-Pierre Trotignon, Tim Yeo and Jacques Gounon.
The Committee did not meet in 2020.


-----

**4.2.6** **SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

Once a year, the Board of Directors conducts a formal evaluation, previously overseen by the Senior Independent Director
and since 2020 overseen by the Chairwoman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The assessment is based on
a detailed anonymous questionnaire addressing the roles and skills of the Board, its functioning as a whole and the individual
areas of its activity and that of its committees. The use of a questionnaire makes it possible to make the assessment process
objective and to give the appropriate weight to the assessments made by the directors.

The questionnaire consists of more than 70 questions, divided into six topics:

composition of the Board of Directors and term of office;

Board meetings (organisation of meetings, access to information for directors, content and quality of discussions,
relations with committees, training of directors and minutes);

Internal Rules;

directors’ remuneration;

quality of the assessment; and

role and performance of the specialist committees.

All the members of the Board of Directors (except the Chairman and Carlo Bertazzo who has been newly appointed), i.e. 13
directors, replied. They were asked to rate their assessments from 1 to 5 in descending order of satisfaction, with 1
corresponding to “completely satisfied” and 5 to “not at all satisfied”.

The Chairwoman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee presented the detailed findings to the Board. It was the
subject of a specific agenda item at its meeting on 28 January 2021.

The overall average of responses was 1.41 compared to 1.52 in 2019. The Directors’ responses to the questionnaire presented
to them show that once again this year they have a very positive assessment (scores 1 and 2) on the vast majority (87%) of
the topics covered. With an average of 1.38, the effective contribution of each director to the work of the Board of Directors
(competence and involvement) was judged very satisfactory. The Board considered itself very satisfied (scores 1 and 2 only),
in relation to the manner in which the separation of the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was implemented.
The Board of Directors debated the functioning of the Board through a collective sharing of objective observations and
discussed possible pragmatic areas for improvement, as well as their translation into action in particular with regard to the
strengthening of the participation of operational directors in the meetings of the Board of Directors and the pursuit of
objectives on the staggering of terms of office of Board members, and on internationalisation.

It will be recalled that the last external and formal triennial evaluation of the operation of the Board of Directors and its
Committees was carried out in 2019 in respect of the 2018 financial year with the support of an external firm specialising in
corporate governance which conducted interviews with each of the directors on the basis of a formalised interview guide.

**4.2.7** **PRINCIPLES AND RULES RELATING TO THE DETERMINATION OF REMUNERATION AND ALL BENEFITS OF ANY**

**KIND GRANTED TO CORPORATE OFFICERS**

In accordance with article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code, the principles and rules relating to the determination
of remuneration and all benefits of any kind, to which corporate officers are entitled, are determined by the Board on the
recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in accordance with the Board’s Internal Rules. They are
set out in as set out in chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document.

The Afep/Medef Code is the code to which Getlink SE has regard to when drafting the report required by article L. 225-37
of the French Commercial Code, pursuant to the French law of 3 July 2008 implementing EU Directive 2006/46/EC of
14 June 2006. In accordance with recommendation 27.1 of the Afep/Medef Code, the recommendations of the Code that
have not been implemented by the company and the reasons for this are set out in the report.

The Afep/Medef Code requires a precise statement on the application of its recommendations and, where applicable, an
explanation of the reasons why any recommendations have not been implemented by the company. Currently, Getlink SE
does not apply the following recommendations:

9.5.6 Independent Directors The criteria that the
committee and the
board should consider
before declaring a
director as
independent are as
follows: […]

“not be a director of
the company for more
than 12 years. The loss
of independence
arrives at 12 years.”


Colette Neuville joined the Board of Directors as an independent director. In
2019, she reached 12 years of service on the Board. The Board considered that
the objectivity, independence of mind, freedom of expression, involvement and
critical spirit always shown by Colette Neuville and that enable her to challenge
general management in the definition of the company’s strategy and the
conduct of business are all qualities that justify her classification as independent
for the rest of her term of office. Given her in-depth knowledge of the Group,
which allows her to understand the challenges accompanying the company’s
development, the Board wished Colette Neuville to continue to act as Senior
Independent Director until the end of her term of office namely on 30 April 2020.

Colette Neuville’s term of office expired at the end of the General Meeting on
30 April 2020 and she was not proposed for re-appointment.

**5.1** **REMUNERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS**

**5.1.1** **REMUNERATION POLICY (EX-ANTE VOTE)**

The following constitutes the remuneration policy for the executive officers in accordance with article L. 22-10-8 of the French
Commercial Code. This policy sets out the elements that make up the fixed and variable remuneration and explains the
decision-making process for the determination, review, and implementation of the policy. It set out the principles and the
criteria applicable to the determination, allocation and distribution of the fixed, variable and exceptional elements that make
up the total remuneration and benefits of any kind relating to the executive officers of Getlink SE by reason of their
appointment. Each year the policy is the subject of a vote during the General Meeting.

The 2021 remuneration policy for the executive officers (namely the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer) as set out
below was agreed by the Board of Directors on 24 February 2021, upon the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration
Committee. The elements of the remuneration policy presented below are the subject of resolutions to be submitted to the
shareholders’ General Meeting. If the meeting does not approve these resolutions, the remuneration policy approved by the
previous General Meeting will continue to apply.

**a)** **Principles**

**Executive officers in office**

Following the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board wishes the remuneration policy
for the executive officers to be simple, to offer continuity over time and to be measured and consistent with the Group’s
overall remuneration policy. The remuneration for the executive officers is linked to medium- and long-term growth, to the
intrinsic value of the company and to the share performance.

The Board has decided that the remuneration policy should take into account all the business’s key challenges (whether
strategic, workforce-related, societal and environmental), and not merely financial performance.

Upon the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board ensures that the remuneration of the
executive officers is aligned with the long-term interests of the company and of its shareholders, and that the different
elements of their remuneration (fixed and variable remuneration, share options or shares and the grant of additional
retirement benefits as the case may be) are commensurate and compliant with the principles set out in the Afep/Medef
Code. The Board intends that the criteria should not create a risk of encouraging executive officers to favour short-term
goals that could influence their variable remuneration and that may have a negative influence on the company in the medium
and long term.

In particular, the Board adheres to the following guidelines:

**Completeness: all elements that form part of the remuneration of executive officers are reviewed each year: the fixed**
and variable elements and long-term incentive plans, benefits in kind, directors’ remuneration and retirement conditions.

**Intelligibility of the rules and balance: the rules are simple, stable, transparent and, as far as is possible, long-lasting.**
Each element of remuneration is clearly substantiated and is in keeping with the general interests of the business: the
variable part intended to reflect the actual contribution of the executive officers to the success of the Group changes
according to criteria representing the results of the Group as well as the operational targets set for the year.
At the start of each financial year, the Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee
which leads the process, defines each of the objectives set for the executive officers for the relevant year and determines
what proportion of the overall variable portion each of them may represent.

After the close of the financial year, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee evaluates the achievement of the
targets and, based on recommendations from the Committee, the Board decides the variable part to be awarded to each
executive officer. The variable remuneration awarded for a given financial year is therefore paid in the following year:

   - The part based on the achievement of targets linked to the Group’s intrinsic annual performance is based on financial
indicators determined according to Group objectives.

   - The part based on the achievement of operational targets is based on criteria set taking into account strategic
objectives contained in the strategic plan and the five-year plan agreed by the Board, which correspond to required
short-term actions, which are essential for the business in the medium- to long-term.


-----

From the outset, Getlink SE’s executive officer remuneration policy has been designed to support the high-level
development vision of the Group and that is what prevails when the remuneration criteria are being decided:

    - to ensure the viability of the business in the first phase of the Group’s history, when the choice of criteria was
linked to the financial restructuring of Eurotunnel or the completion of the public exchange offer;

    - then to operational priorities to support the business’s development strategy, such as the development of
commercial activities, with the choice of criteria being linked to market share and the yield policy and to
innovations in customer service; and

    - all while having regard to the preservation of the infrastructure, with the choice of criteria being those such as the
Salamandre plan, the creation of the SAFE stations and the long-term improvement of the security arrangements
for the Fixed Link and more generally to protect the business.

   - The strategy of the Group is orientated towards responsible growth, having regard for all stakeholders. The use of a
societal performance criterion is a reflection of the history and values of the Group, which from the start has
committed itself to a social responsibility policy that is designed to reconcile economic performance, social justice
and protection of the environment.

    - Since 2012, CSR has been one of the criteria that determine the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s variable
remuneration (10%). Initially, the criterion was called “Quality of social dialogue in support of performance”. The
then Remuneration Committee formalised matters in 2014 and it started a discussion around the creation of a
CSR composite performance index. The Group asked an external firm to create a benchmark relating to the
practices of CAC 40 companies and conducted a qualitative inquiry of its internal and external stakeholders. This
identified some topics directly linked to Group operations. Indicators and targets have been set for each of these
topics in order to be able to determine the rate of achievement of each target. A resolution will be proposed at
the General Meeting on 28 April 2021 that this composite index, which has been used since 2015, be used once
again in 2021 for the Chief Executive Officer’s short-term variable remuneration.

    - The long-term incentive plans are based on internal and external performance criteria so as to align the long-term
financial interests of the shareholders in such a way as to enhance the decisions of senior managers, which are
crucial for the future of the business, and which could have an impact only over the long term. In 2020, Getlink
worked to enhance its CSR strategy and to ensure the engagement of those concerned and to enable the company
to progress and achieve its objectives, as part of which the Board of Directors decided to include the 2021
performance action plan in the CSR strategy review cycle. Long-term incentive plans are subject to performance
criteria to be met over a three-year period in line with the 2023 CSR objectives. The Board of Directors has decided
to propose to the Annual General Meeting that the CSR criteria usually used in long-term incentive plans be
altered so as to align Getlink's social, societal and environmental ambitions for 2023 with the day-to-day
operations of the company.

**Measurement: remuneration is determined taking into account the general interests of the business, market practices**
and the performance of the executive officers. Each year, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee receives
benchmarking information from an independent firm specialising in the remuneration of executive officers, relating to
comparable organisations both in terms of revenue and headcount and based on a sample that has been running for
several years: Altran Technologies, Bic, Biomérieux, CGG, Edenred, Eramet, Eurofins Scientific, Eutelsat communications,
Imerys, Ingenico, Ipsen, JC Decaux, Métropole TV (M6), Quadient (ex Neopost), Rémy Cointreau, Seb, Tarkett, TF1, Ubisoft
Entertainment, Vallourec and Vicat.

From an incentive perspective, the aim is not to stand out from market practice, whether it be in respect of a sectoral
benchmark or a benchmark of comparables in terms of revenue and headcount.

In addition, since 2018, the relative performance of the Getlink SE share is assessed by reference to the Group’s sectoral
index, the GPR Getlink Index. This index is made up of an international sectoral panel including the following companies:
Aena SME SA, Aéroports de Paris, Atlantia S.p.A., DFDS A/S, Eiffage SA, Électricité de France SA, Engie SA, Ferrovial SA,
Firstgroup PLC, Flughafen Zurich AG, Fraport AG, National Grid PLC, Stagecoach Group PLC and Vinci SA.

**Internal and external consistency: the Nomination and Remuneration Committee ensures that the remuneration policy**
proposed to the Board of Directors is:

   - adapted to each individual’s responsibilities;

   - measured and consistent with the remuneration policy for the employees of the Group;

   - in line with comparable groups; in order to consider the consistency of the remuneration of the executive officers,
the Committee examines the positioning of their remuneration, in line with market practice, in relation to
remuneration paid by peer groups; and

   - linked to the performance of the ordinary shares of Getlink SE, in the interests of optimising the performance of
committed capital and to align incentives between executive officers and shareholders.

Only in very specific circumstances may exceptional remuneration be awarded (for example, by reason of the importance
to the company, the implications that are involved and the difficulties that the circumstances present). The payment of
such remuneration must be reasoned and the event giving rise to the payment specifically set out.


-----

In the event of a significant change affecting the calculation of the Group’s economic parameters, such as a change in
accounting standards or a significant asset transaction approved by the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors may
calculate the parameters mutatis mutandis, i.e. excluding extraordinary exogenous elements. In accordance with
paragraph III of article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors reserves the right in exceptional
circumstances to depart from the application of the policy approved by vote provided that the deviation is temporary,
consistent with the corporate interest and necessary to ensure the company’s continued existence or viability and
provided also that it does not alter the structure, philosophy or criteria voted by the General Meeting.

**b)** **When executive officers take up or leave their posts**

In accordance with the Afep/Medef Code, a “golden hello” payment, which is payable on taking up new duties, can be
awarded only to a new executive officer coming from a company outside of the Group to offset the loss of advantages that
the executive officer may have benefited from in his previous position. The payment must be explained and the amount
must be made public when it is set, even in the case of a deferred payment or payment in instalments.

Predefined payment made when the functions of an executive officer come to an end are subject to the procedure for
regulated agreements. The departure indemnity must not exceed, where applicable, two years of remuneration (annual fixed
and variable).

When a non-competition clause is furthermore stipulated, the Board of Directors has to resolve whether or not to apply the
clause at the time of the departure of the executive officer, in particular when the executive officer is leaving the company
to avail himself of or after having availed himself of his retirement rights.

In any case, the total amount of the two payments cannot exceed the ceiling of two years of remuneration (annual fixed and
variable). The ceiling also covers, where applicable, payments linked to the termination of an employment contract.

**c)** **Rules for holding and retaining long-term remuneration instruments specific to executive officers**

Individual grants of long-term remuneration instruments to executive officers are limited to 15% of each grant per individual,
without exceeding 150% of the target short-term remuneration, based on the IFRS valuation (according to the applicable
model) at the grant date.

The Board of Directors, pursuant to the recommendations of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, reiterated, at
its meeting on 24 February 2021, the restrictive holding and retention rules applicable to executive officers. They are required
to hold a number of ordinary shares, upon conversion or exercise of long-term incentive instruments, at least equal to 50%
of the total number of ordinary shares definitively acquired for the entire term of their appointment.

Executive officers are not allowed to engage in any leveraged transactions in Getlink securities or transactions of a speculative
nature, under the terms of the recommendation of the Afep/Medef Code. In accordance with the recommendation of the
Afep/Medef Code, executive officers undertake (i) not to use hedging instruments on any share options and performance
shares that may be granted to them during their term of office, and (ii) to refrain from exercising share options that may be
granted to them during their term of office during so-called negative window periods.

In the event of the executive officer's departure, the definitive allocation of ordinary shares is made on the basis of (i) the
fulfilment of the performance conditions applicable to the plans in question on the dates initially set, and (ii) the executive
officer’s actual presence within the Group during the period of assessment of the performance conditions. The overall
allocation rate (after application of the performance conditions) is applied at best pro rata, in proportion to the number of
months of actual presence of the executive officer in the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria.
This principle applies to executive officers in all cases of forced departure for reasons other than serious misconduct or gross
negligence, which give rise to loss of long-term remuneration instruments and barring legal exceptions. No grant is made
to the executive officer in the year of departure, in accordance with the Afep/Medef Code.

**d)** **Structure of the remuneration of executive officers in office**

The remuneration awarded to the executives is structured in a balanced way so as to reward both short- and long-term
performance. The remuneration awarded to each of the executive officers varies in amount and criteria, so as to take into
account the nature of their office, in terms of experience and responsibilities.


-----

**i)** **Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for 2021**

The remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for 2021 will be comprised of:

a fixed annual remuneration;

an annual variable remuneration subject to performance criteria;

benefits in kind;

a supplementary defined contribution pension plan; and

a long-term variable remuneration in the form of shares granted subject to performance criteria.

The Chief Executive Officer, as an executive officer, does not benefit from an employment contract with Getlink.

The Chief Executive Office, who did not benefit from any “golden hello” payment, does not have the benefit of any contractual
severance or non-competition payment. He will not receive any free shares under the collective free share allocation plans
set up by the organisation for the benefit of all Group employees.

**Annual fixed remuneration for 2021**

The fixed part of the Chief Executive Officer’s gross annual remuneration for 2021 will be €400,000, unchanged from the
fixed annual remuneration set when he took office on 1 July 2020. In 2020. the Board of Directors adopted an intentionally
conservative approach taking into account the implementation of a transition period with an enhanced chairmanship to
allow a smooth and orderly transition, with the remuneration being likely to evolve in a manner consistent with the transition.
In the context of the current public health crisis, and in order to adjust to the situation, the Board of Directors decided not
to alter the Chief Executive Officer’s fixed annual remuneration for 2021.

**Annual variable remuneration for 2021**

Annual variable remuneration is intended to reflect the personal contribution of the CEO of the Group to an improvement
in its results. It is balanced in proportion to the fixed remuneration and determined as a percentage of the fixed remuneration.

The variable part of annual remuneration is determined using a target remuneration equal to 100% of the annual fixed
remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer. The cap is set at 120% of fixed remuneration. Payment of the annual variable
remuneration is not deferred (beyond the General Meeting vote). It is made up of criteria selected to support the strategy
of the business. For 2021, it is made up of 50% financial criteria that are 100% quantifiable (EBITDA and cash flow) aimed at
rewarding economic performance and 50% strategic and sustainable development criteria, making a total of 75% based on
quantifiable criteria as summarised in the table below.

Financial objectives (50%)

The following two indicators enable the quality of the Group's economic and financial management to be assessed from
various complementary angles:

Profitability of the operations process (25%): improvement in the profitability of operations assessed by reference to the
level of achievement of the consolidated EBITDA / consolidated revenue target ratio, at constant exchange rates and


-----

scope and comparable level of health constraints and traffic restrictions. In the event that constraints are greater in 2021
than in 2020, the Board of Directors will apply the ratio pro rata;.

Consolidated 2021 operational cash flow compared to that forecast in the budget (25%), at a constant exchange rate
and for the current scope of activities: (scope: Eurotunnel, Getlink, Europorte and ElecLink).

Operational objectives (40%)

Commercial development (15%): in the context of travel restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, post-Brexit
administrative and customs complexities.
Objective: steering the optimisation of the commercial strategy (assessment of the depth of the diagnostics, review of
the analysis of customers’ expectations and needs, environment, vision, assessment of changes in value chains that are
sources of opportunities).

Borders (10%): the challenges to be managed in terms of throughput and fluidity at the Tunnel terminals, set against the
additional constraints linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis and future regulatory changes.
Objective: steering the efficiency of the management of (i) the operational organisation, the reliability and optimisation
of the systems and procedures implemented on 1 January 2021, (ii) the preparation and implementation of customs
formalities for travelling to the United Kingdom and (iii) preparation for projects, in particular those of the European
Commission, aimed at modernising border management and increasing the safety and security of the Schengen area;

ElecLink (15%): pulling and installation of the cable in the Tunnel, in accordance with the schedule and budget set for
commissioning by mid-2022 at the latest.

CSR objectives (10%)

For 2021, the Board wished to retain the CSR composite performance index which allows performance to be measured over
the course of a year. This index is structured around four themes directly related to the Group’s operations: health and safety,
social climate, greenhouse gas emissions and customer satisfaction. For each of these themes, the indicators and targets set
out in chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document enable the calculation of an achievement rate of the composite
index: the composite index corresponds to the average percentage achievement of the indicators referred to, with a
multiplication coefficient weighted towards the environmental indicator. The social and environmental indicators are certified
every year by one of the statutory auditors in their capacity as an independent third party.

Methodology

The budgetary targets for 2021 were determined according to the Group’s budget as reviewed by the Board. For
confidentiality reasons, the financial targets set for each of the above quantitative criteria are not disclosed.

The financial data is adjusted for exceptional external factors, if any, in order to neutralise their impact and keep genuinely
comparable data: at a constant exchange rate and scope of consolidation.

The annual variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer is adjusted according to a scale, depending on the degree
of achievement of the target concerned.

**Payment rate (operating cash flow)**

Achievement rate* -2.10 -1.05 **Target** +1.05 +2.10 +3.15 +4.21 **+5**

Payment rate 93.34% 95% **100%** 105% 107% 112% 115% **120%**

**Payment rate (non-financial quantifiable targets)**


Achievement rate 90% 95% **Target**

Linear interpolation

Payment rate 80% 90% **100%** **120%**


This scale enables the over-performance of some criteria to be taken into account, without however the total amount
exceeding the maximum of 120% set by the Board for the variable part of the remuneration.

In the absence of a deferral, there is no provision for the possibility of claiming back part of the annual variable remuneration.

In accordance with the provisions of article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code, payment in year N of the annual
variable remuneration for year N-1 is subject to a favourable vote by the shareholders’ General Meeting.


-----

**Long-term variable remuneration for 2021**

Remuneration in shares is an essential element for Getlink to make itself attractive as an employer, since it seeks to converge
the interests of employees and shareholders and to strengthen employees’ attachment to the Group.

Each year, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors proposes a
Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan for the executive officers and senior managers and other categories of Group employees
(high potential or key contributors) in a position to promote the development of the business through their actions in the
form of performance shares or preference shares convertible into ordinary shares.

The Board’s policy in this respect is characterised by control of the dilution of capital and multiple performance conditions
spread over a number of years. Ordinary shares in the LTI plans are shares purchased by the company under the buy-back
scheme.

For 2021, the LTI plan will be structured as performance shares subject to performance criteria measured over three years.
The performance shares allocated to the Chief Executive Officer will be wholly subject to internal and external performance
conditions that are demanding, measured over a minimum period of three years and that do not guarantee a minimum
allocation or gain.

On 28 April 2021, the General Meeting will be asked to authorise a long-term incentive plan for the allotment of performance
shares in proportions comparable to the already reduced quantities in 2020, for the benefit of the Group's executive officers
and senior managers, including the Chief Executive Officer and high-potential key contributors. This plan, already reduced
in 2020 from 1,500,000 shares in 2019 to 265,000 shares, would cover a total of 300,000 shares in 2021. The plan includes
the Chief Executive Officer for a share limited to a maximum of 15% of the total allocation and senior executives and highpotential key contributors. Subject to the approval of the plan by the General Meeting of 28 April 2021, the final allocation
of the ordinary shares would be based on achieving four cumulative performance criteria, parts of which are identical to
those used by Getlink for previous plans and parts of which have been revised in the light of the work undertaken to
strengthen the company's commitment to limiting its greenhouse gas emissions over a three-year period.

The **external performance condition (the “TSR weighting”) would be based on the average performance including**
dividends (TSR) of the Getlink SE ordinary share over a period of three years compared to the Group’s sectoral index, the
GPR Getlink Index. Since 2018, the relative performance of the Getlink SE share has been measured in comparison to the
sectoral GPR Getlink Index. This index was created in 2018 by an external firm a specialist in creating indices and a subsidiary
of the Dutch bank Kempen & Co, from stocks representative of the Group’s activities. This index created by this firm is in
accordance with a methodology that conforms with the EU directive UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investments in
Transferable Securities). The reference panel is composed of companies operating in similar industries to Getlink. It includes:

European transport infrastructure companies mirroring the Group’s business (Vinci, Atlantia and ADP etc);

British transport companies mirroring Getlink’s exposure to the United Kingdom (Stagecoach and Firstgroup);

a ferry operator for the cross-Channel activity (DFDS); and

electricity companies in anticipation of ElecLink’s contribution to results (EDF, Engie and National Grid).

GPR Getlink Index reference panel: Aena SME SA, Aéroports de Paris, Atlantia S.p.A., DFDS A/S, Eiffage SA, Électricité de
France SA, Engie SA, Ferrovial SA, Firstgroup PLC, Flughafen Zurich AG, Fraport AG, National Grid PLC, Stagecoach Group
PLC and Vinci SA.

This element determines 45% of the cumulative weighting of shares that can be granted. The final attribution of ordinary
shares linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective, it being borne in mind that:

should the TSR of the Getlink SE ordinary share be strictly less than the performance of the GPR Getlink Index over the
aforementioned period of three years, no shares will be granted; and

should the TSR of the Getlink SE ordinary share be equal to the performance of the GPR Getlink Index over the
aforementioned period of three years, 15% of the number that can be granted will be granted, with the whole being
capped at 45% of the number that can be granted.

The first **internal performance condition (the “Working Ratio weighting”) would be based on the 2023 economic**
performance of the Group's rail operator activities, i.e. the Shuttle and Europorte activities, assessed by reference to their
capacity to recover their operating costs from their annual revenue and measure on the basis of the following ratio known
as the Working Ratio.

Ratio: operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortisation) / revenue

Objective: improvement in the 2023 Working Ratio compared with 2019 thanks to the commercial policy and operational
excellence.

three point improvement in the Working Ratio if the 2023 traffic levels return to the 2019 levels;

two point improvement in the Working Ratio if the 2023 traffic levels reach 90% of the 2019 levels; and

if the traffic in 2023 does not reach 90% of the 2019 level, then no shares will be granted.


-----

Allocation calculation

should the average rate of achievement of the Working Ratio improvement objective be strictly less than 100%, then no
shares will be granted;

should the average rate of achievement of the Working Ratio improvement objective be equal to or greater than 100%
15% of the number that can be granted will effectively be granted; and

the award rate above 15% will be based on outperformance against the target, with the whole being capped at 30%.

This element determines 30% of the cumulative weighting.

The second internal performance condition (the “Climate weighting”) would be based on the objective of reducing the
Group’s direct emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 15% within three years (in tonnes of CO2 equivalent) like-for-like compared to
2019 emissions; in the event that the rate of achievement of the objective is strictly less than 100%, there would be no
allocation; and in the event that the rate of achievement of the objective is equal to or greater than 100%, 15% of the number
that can be granted will be granted, with the whole being capped at 15%. This element determines 15% of the cumulative
weighting.

The third internal performance condition (the "CSR weighting") would be based on the achievement of the following four
objectives:

safety: quantitative target to increase safety training;

equality between men and women: recruitment of at least 40% of each gender;

social climate; and

quality of service measured by the results of satisfaction surveys, the number of complaints and Twitter sentiment.

This element determines 10% of the cumulative weighting. Should the rate of achievement of the objective be strictly less
than 100%, there would be no allocation; and should the rate of achievement of the objective be equal to or greater than
100%, 10% of the of the number that can be granted will be granted, with a ceiling of 10%.

The exact number of ordinary shares that will be acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period will depend
on the degree of achievement of the performance, it being borne in mind that:

should the achievement rate of each criterion be less than 100%, there will be no right to ordinary shares,

should the achievement rate be equal to or greater than 100%, the allocation ratio of the ordinary shares will follow a
progressive scale depending on the degree of achievement of the objectives,

the allocation ratio of the ordinary shares will reach 39% of its potential if each criterion is equal to its intermediate level
(corresponding to an average weighted achievement of 105.75%), and

the allocation ratio of the ordinary shares will reach 100% of its potential if each criterion exceeds its upper level. In any
case, if the weighted average rate of achievement is less than 112%, the allocation ratio of the ordinary shares will not
reach 100% of its potential.

**Restrictive rules of detention and conservation**

The allocations to the Chief Executive Officer shall be subject to the rules applicable to executive officers as set forth in
section 5.1.1.c of this Universal Registration Document.

**Benefits in kind for 2021**

The Chief Executive Officer will have a company car in accordance with the Group’s Human Resources company car scheme.

**Supplementary defined contribution pension plan/death and disability insurance for 2021**

The Chief Executive Officer will not have a defined benefit pension plan.

The Chief Executive Officer will benefit from a basic retirement benefits plan and a complementary pension plan.

The Chief Executive Officer will benefit from the supplementary pension plan applicable to all Getlink senior managers above
the B remuneration bracket. This plan, whose beneficiaries include people other than the Group’s executive officers, is not a
defined benefit plan. It is a collective defined contribution plan.

The Chief Executive Officer is covered by a death and disability insurance and personal accident policies available to
Getlink SE employees.

**Payment for leaving office**

No payments are due at the end of the term of office.


-----

**ii)** **Chairman 2021**

The Chairman’s remuneration for 2021 will consist of:

a fixed annual remuneration; and

benefits in kind/director’s remuneration.

**Annual fixed remuneration for 2021**

In view of the continuation in 2021 of the enhanced duties of the Chairman described in section 4.1.1 of this Universal
Registration Document, the Board of Directors has decided to keep the Chairman’s fixed remuneration at its current amount
of €600,000 gross per year.

**Benefits in kind/director’s remuneration for 2021**

The Chairman will benefit from an allowance for the use of a personal vehicle in accordance with Getlink’s policy and, in
respect of his office as a director, will receive director’s remuneration in the same way as the other members of the Board of
Directors.

**Retirement**

The Chairman has asserted his rights to the basic and complementary pension schemes. To date, the pension rights are still
being reconstituted.

With regard to additional pension contributions, the Chairman benefits from the supplementary pension scheme open to all
Getlink executives above and beyond the B tranche. The Chairman will be covered by the death and disabilities contract, as
well as by the personal accident policy of Getlink SE.

**Payment for leaving office**

No payments are due at the end of the term of office of the Chairman.

**iii)** **Directors’ remuneration**

The Directors of Getlink SE receive remuneration in respect of their office as directors, which was previously referred to as
attendance fees.

The maximum total amount of directors’ remuneration was reviewed at the General Meeting of 30 April 2020. It had been
set at €825,000 by the shareholders’ Combined General Meeting of 27 April 2017 at a time when the Board was composed
of 11 members. When the number of Board members was increased from 11 to 15 in 2018, the Board of Directors took
account of the need to review the overall annual remuneration package for directors in order to maintain a high international
representation on the Board of Directors and to attract and retain highly qualified individuals to sit on the Board of Directors
in the context of the work to renew the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors proposed to the General Meeting of 30
April 2020, which resolution was approved, that the overall annual remuneration package of the Board of Directors be
increased to €950,000. Despite the increase in the overall remuneration approved by a vote at the General Meeting and in
the interests of taking a measured approach in the current context, the Board of Directors has not made the corresponding
adjustment to the allocation of the overall annual budget, which has remained in line with the initial lower budget. As
described in section 5.1.2.e of this Universal Registration Document, the amount of the remuneration:

includes a fixed portion and a predominant variable portion determined on the basis of actual attendance at meetings;

is increased for directors who cross a border to attend a Board meeting;

includes an additional variable portion for actual committee participation; committee members receive this additional
remuneration for each time they participate in a different committee.

Nevertheless, in the second half of 2020 and in view of the continued impossibility for British, Italian and US resident directors
to attend Board meetings in person because of travel restrictions the Board of Directors decided to freeze the reduction
when directors participate in Board meetings by videoconference or telephone.


-----

**5.1.2** **REMUNERATION PAID OR AWARDED DURING OR IN RESPECT OF THE 2020 FINANCIAL YEAR (EX-POST VOTE)**

In accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code, the elements that make up the total
remuneration and benefits of any kind paid or granted for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 to Jacques Gounon,
in respect of his office of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer then Chairman, to Yann Leriche, in respect of his office as
Chief Executive Officer in the second half of the year and to François Gauthey in respect of his office of Deputy Chief Executive
Officer, are set out below.

In the context of the difficulties generated by the public health crisis, Getlink's choice has been one of responsibility, of a
measured approach and a shared effort while prioritising human safety, job retention and continuity of operations.

Getlink has not sought any government-backed loans, guarantees or deferrals of tax payments. In order to preserve
employment while fulfilling its public service mission and, in parallel with the withdrawal of the dividend distribution planned
in respect of 2019, the implementation of the measures to restrict operating expenses and optimise capital expenditure
presented in section 1.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document, as part of the arrangements put in place by the French
and British governments, Getlink has implemented a short-time working arrangement for some of its staff in France and the
United Kingdom, with compensation from the company for the lowest salaries, since the most economically fragile category
of staff is likely to be the most affected by salary losses in the context of the public health crisis.

This was accompanied by a reduction in the remuneration of executive officers, as well as members of the Executive
Committee and senior management, on a voluntary basis, for the duration of the short-time working. The members of the
Board of Directors joined in and part of their fixed remuneration was reduced.

As a joint contribution to the collective effort and in order to contribute to the necessary cost reduction imposed by the
situation, it was proposed to the Group's top management (executive officers and 27 officers) that they at the same time
accept a temporary reduction in their fixed remuneration of at least 10% over several months of the year (in the second and
fourth quarters). This call was followed by more than 70% of the senior managers approached.

The temporary reductions in the remuneration of Jacques Gounon and Yann Leriche are set out in sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2
of this Universal Registration Document.

In accordance with article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, the General Meeting of 28 April 2021 will be asked
to vote on the elements paid or granted for the previous financial year, with the variable remuneration elements paid only
after approval of the said remuneration by the General Meeting which will vote ex-post.

The remuneration policy applicable to the executive officers for 2020 was approved at the General Meeting on 30 April 2020,
with a majority of 99.22% of the votes cast in respect of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and 98.70% in respect of
the Chief Executive Officer. With the exception of the reductions in the remuneration of the executive officers and, subject
to the proposed adjustment submitted to the shareholders' vote to make up for the technical absence of an EBITDA target
for the financial year 2020, the items of remuneration set out below comply with the rules and principles laid down for
determining the remuneration and benefits of any kind for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chairman and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for the 2020 financial year and approved by the General Meeting
of 30 April 2020.

The remuneration amounts shown in this chapter cover all the remuneration due or granted to executive officers, for all their
offices or functions within the Group.

**Remuneration owed to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the first half of 2020**

The remuneration owed to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jacques Gounon, for the first half of 2020 is
comprised of:

a fixed annual remuneration;

an annual variable remuneration subject to performance criteria;

director’s remuneration (formerly attendance fees);

benefits in kind; and

a supplementary defined contribution pension plan.

In view of the Covid-19 crisis, Jacques Gounon waived 25% of his fixed remuneration in the period of the organisation’s
short-time working scheme that coincided with his term as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. His variable annual
remuneration for the first half of the year was reduced to 76% and, as an executive officer, he will lose one third of the shares
attached to the EBITDA criterion under the 2018 LTI plan, which expires in 2021.

**Fixed remuneration for the first half of 2020**

The fixed part of the gross annual remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer owed for the first half of 2020
is €300,000.

The remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2020 was reduced by 25% for the period during which
employees of the company were on short-time working until the end of his period of office as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer.

Since Jacques Gounon wished to waive 25% of his fixed remuneration during the period of his term of office as Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer when the company was in short-time working for the second quarter of 2020, the amount of his
gross remuneration paid was reduced from €300,000 gross to €262,500 gross for the first half of 2020.


-----

**Variable remuneration for the first half of 2020**

Ceiling

The ceiling for the variable part of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s annual remuneration is 120% of the annual
basic salary for the first half of 2020; it is calculated on a base of €360,000 representing 120% of the annual fixed
remuneration due for the first half of 2020.

Financial objectives (40%):

   - consolidated net result for the year compared to the net result forecast in the budget (20%), at a constant exchange
rate and for the current scope of activities: Eurotunnel, Getlink, Europorte and ElecLink;

   - consolidated EBITDA target as announced to the market for 2020 (20%): given the unprecedented nature of the
situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lack of visibility, the Group withdrew its 2020 EBITDA target.

Strategic objectives (50%):

   - onboarding (15%): orchestrating in advance the assumption of duties and the integration of the Chief Executive
Officer into the company: preparation of the changes in governance;

   - steering the implementation of the Brexit preparation arrangements, in line with changes during the Withdrawal
Agreement Transition Period (20%):

    - implementation of the smart border and other measures;

    - steering of external actions: representation of the Group in relations with governments and political partners of
the company; representation of the Group (IGC and regulatory negotiations).

   - ElecLink: authorisation to pull the cable through the Tunnel (15%).

CSR objectives (10%).

On 18 February 2021, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer by reference to the performance indicators above and made its recommendations to the Board of Directors.

With regard to the criterion of net profit achieved, the Committee stated that the level of achievement of the objective did
not reach 93.34% and that performance on this criterion did not generate any variable remuneration.

With regard to the EBITDA criterion, the Committee stated that the 2020 EBITDA target, that had been communicated to the
market on the basis of assumptions that had not proved viable given the public health crisis, and so it had been withdrawn.
Not being technically able to assess the performance of the executive officer in relation to this criterion, the Committee
exceptionally decided to propose to the Board of Directors that the 2020 EBITDA criterion relating to the 2020 short-term
variable remuneration be replaced with a transparent and market-acknowledged relative share performance criterion, by
reference to the average performance - including dividends - of the Getlink SE ordinary share over the 2020 financial year,
compared to the performance of the GPR Getlink Index.

This TSR (Total Shareholder Return) criterion, which the market has seen being used by Getlink for several years in long-term
incentive plans, has the merit of transparency and it also makes it possible to reward the work of the executive officers in
2020 to get through the crisis, by strictly aligning the interests of the executive with those of the shareholder and which is
reflected in the performance of the Getlink SE share in 2020 compared with its peers. Since 2018, the relative performance
of the Getlink SE ordinary share has been assessed in relation to the performance of the Group's sector index, the GPR Getlink
Index. This index is based on an international sector panel comprising the following companies: Aena SME SA, Aéroports de
Paris, Atlantia S.p.A., DFDS A/S, Eiffage SA, Électricité de France SA, Engie SA, Ferrovial SA, Firstgroup PLC, Flughafen Zurich
AG, Fraport AG, National Grid PLC, Stagecoach Group PLC and Vinci SA.

Since the internal performance condition linked to EBITDA is not applicable, the Committee decided to propose to the Board
of Directors that it be replaced by an external performance condition based on the stock market performance of the
Getlink SE share (Total Shareholder Return) compared to the performance of its benchmark GPR Getlink Index over the year
2020, as follows:

**Payment rate (TSR criterion)**


TSR vs GPR Getlink Index TSR < Index


TSR > 1.2 x Index


Payment rate 0% 100%

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee decided to propose to the Board of Directors that this amendment be put
to the shareholders for a vote, albeit to a more limited extent than that initially foreseen for EBITDA, at 65%. Subject to the
acceptance of this amendment by the General Meeting of 28 April 2021, the annual variable remuneration determined on
these bases will be voted on by the General Meeting of shareholders ex-post.


-----

The Nomination and Remuneration committee reviewed the various aspects of the implementation of the Group's strategy:

With regard to the preparation for Brexit, the Committee welcomed the work of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
who represented Getlink in its high-level relations, both nationally and internationally, and in particular with the public
authorities and with Getlink's strategic partners and stakeholders, within a context of overall pre-emption of the different
options, carried out at the double level of making the public authorities aware of the specific requirements and economic
reality of cross-Channel transport as well as identifying practical potential constraints. The committee praised the steering
of the implementation with the authorities of a coherent and fluid system and was able to observe the smooth operation
as of 1 January 2021 of the system designed, based on prior online registration and the digital recognition of customers.

With regard to the implementation of the separation of the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the
Committee took note of the organisation of a smooth transition, with the preparation of the strengthening of certain
operational departments (appointment of an administrative and financial director and an environmental director), the
active role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is particularly attentive to overall cohesion, as well as the
functioning of the "dissociated" parallel roles since 1 July, in a harmonious and effective manner and the relations of trust
and mutual respect established between the two of them.

With regard to ElecLink, the Committee considered that the authorisation to pull the cable came in December 2020, i.e.
after the first half of 2020, due to the delays of the IGC, whose work was impacted by the public health crisis; the
Committee accordingly proposed to the Board of Directors that it take into consideration these very exceptional
circumstances, as well as the diligence of the Chairman in the context to achieve this result and so acknowledge the
achievement of this objective.

With regard to the CSR objectives, as measured by the CSR index (10%), the Committee considered that, in the light of the
2020 results, through a significant improvement in the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to revenue and despite a weaker
performance on the absenteeism rate, the objective was achieved at 117.43%.

At its meeting on 24 February 2021, the Board of Directors assessed the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer by reference to the performance indicators set out above. The Board of Directors took the very exceptional
circumstances of 2020 into consideration and in considering the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer it
took into account the manner in which the crisis was managed with regard to the fundamental aspects of the health and
safety of the Group's employees, customers and subcontractors, the pursuit of the public service mission, rigorous cost
management and the implementation of appropriate measures for the strict management of resources and the protection
of the Group's assets.

Following the recommendations of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and taking into account the achievements
referred to, the Board decided to set the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s variable remuneration for the first half of
the year ended 31 December 2020:

at €273,002, subject to the agreement by the General Meeting of 28 April 2021 on the replacement of the EBITDA criterion
by the TSR, or failing that;

at €216,842, in the absence of an agreement by the General Meeting of 28 April 2021 on the replacement of the EBITDA
criterion by the TSR.

€11,400 for the year (2019: €11,400).

Jacques Gounon received remuneration (attendance fees) for his role as a Director of Getlink SE (as set out in the table in
section 5.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document).


-----

**Supplementary defined contribution pension plan/death and disability insurance for 2020**

Jacques Gounon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer then Chairman, does not have a defined benefit pension plan. He
benefits from the supplementary pension plan available to all senior managers employed above the B remuneration bracket.
This plan, whose beneficiaries include people other than the Group’s executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. It is a
defined contribution plan, which would currently grant the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer an estimated pension of
€5,662 per year (non-commutable annuity), assuming immediate retirement and on the basis of the accumulated savings as
at 31 December 2020.

Regarding contributions, the contribution base is the gross annual salary broken down by tranches (A, B, C and beyond C).
The rates applied are 0.50% on tranche A, 0.50% on tranche B, 7.50% on tranche C and 0.00% beyond the C tranche. There
is an exemption from French social security charges associated with the charge to the company within the limit of 5% of the
remuneration capped at five times the annual French social security ceiling and a fixed rate of 20% on the exempt portion.
For tax purposes, the employer contributions are deductible from the result.

The employer contributions for this supplementary pension scheme for 2020 rose to €13,163 (2019: €12,968) out of a total
of €97,127 (2019: €95,499) for all employees concerned.

Jacques Gounon benefits from a basic retirement plan and a complementary retirement plan. In 2019, the contributions for
the complementary pension scheme amounted to €28,911 (2019: €28,416) for the employee contribution and €46,585 (2019:
€45,795) for the employer contribution.

He is covered by death and disability insurance and personal accident policies available to employees of Getlink SE.

**Free shares subject to performance conditions for 2020**

The General Meeting of 30 April 2020 voted in favour of a long-term incentive plan for the Group's executive officers and
senior managers.

In view of the date on which his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer came to an end, namely 1 July 2020,
no performance shares were allocated in respect of the year 2020 to Jacques Gounon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
up to 30 June 2020, then non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1 July 2020. With respect to the preference
shares convertible into ordinary shares and the performance shares previously granted to Jacques Gounon, the vesting
conditions of which will be met on the date of his leaving office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Board of
Directors has taken note of Jacques Gounon's role in the enhanced chairmanship of Getlink SE and has considered that the
condition of Jacques Gounon's presence within the Group provided for in the regulations of the grant plans is met. All the
performance conditions of the plans concerned are maintained.

**LTI plans available in 2020 and 2021**

2017 plan: 65% conversion rate

Free shares subject to performance conditions authorised by the General Meeting of 27 April 2017; in 2020 Jacques Gounon
received 78,000 ordinary shares under the 2017 plan.

2018 plan available in 2021

The General Meeting of 18 April 2018 authorised the creation by the Board of Directors of the D preference shares,
convertible into ordinary shares at a maximum conversion ratio of 1,000 ordinary shares. The one-year vesting period for
French tax residents expired on 18 April 2019 and the issue of 1,127 D preference shares was materially completed. Jacques
Gounon received 150 D preference shares.

The plan provides that the D shares will be converted into ordinary shares, based on performance conditions assessed over
a three-year period according to the following criteria:

long-term economic performance by reference to the Group's consolidated EBITDA for 2018, 2019 and 2020, at 50%;

stock market performance of the Getlink SE ordinary share over the long term compared to the performance of the GPR
Getlink Index - including dividend - for 2018, 2019, and 2020, at 40%;

CSR performance (composite index) at 10%.

In the context of the Covid-19 crisis, Getlink withdrew the 2020 EBITDA target announced to the market. Given the correlative
impossibility of assessing the EBITDA performance, the Board of Directors' meeting of 24 February 2021 decided, in these
exceptional circumstances, to propose to the General Meeting of 28 April 2021, that the EBITDA criterion of the LTI 2018
plan be amended by neutralising the 2020 EBITDA criterion:

for the beneficiaries who are employees but not executive officers, by assessing the EBITDA performance by reference
only to the 2018 and 2019 EBITDA, without reducing the number of ordinary shares attached to the EBITDA performance;

for executive officers by reducing the number of ordinary shares attached to the EBITDA performance by one third to
take into account the neutralisation of the EBITDA criterion for the 2020 financial year.

The delivery of ordinary shares is deferred until the end of the General Meeting of 28 April 2021. The other criteria of the
plan remain unchanged.


-----

2019 and 2020 plans

The 2019 and 2020 plans, the characteristics of which are set out in note E.5 to the consolidated financial statements in
section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document and in chapters 7 and 8 of this Universal Registration Document, are
not yet available.

Share option plans

Three share option plans are currently in place in the organisation. In accordance with the authority conferred by the
Combined General Meeting of 26 May 2010, the Board of Directors proceeded to grant options on 21 July 2011 (2011 plan)
and on 20 July 2012 (2012 plan). All options were subject to external and internal performance conditions (EBITDA, dividends
and share price):

For the 2011 plan, half the performance conditions were met and so 50% of the options were acquired.

For the 2012 plan, 75% of the performance conditions were met and so 75% of the options were acquired.

Under the 2010 plan, which expired in July 2020, Jacques Gounon exercised 48,000 options in 2020 (47,341 on 24 January
and 659 on 5 June).

**Payment for leaving office**

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has received no contractual payment for leaving office.

**Remuneration owed to the Chief Executive Officer for the second half of 2020**

The remuneration due to the Chief Executive Officer, Yann Leriche, for the second half of 2020 is made up of:

a fixed annual remuneration;

an annual variable remuneration subject to performance criteria;

benefits in kind;

a supplementary defined contribution pension plan;

long-term variable remuneration in the form of performance shares.

The Chief Executive Officer did not receive any golden hello payment.

In the context of the Covid-19 crisis, the Chief Executive Officer’s total annual remuneration for 2020 would be 75% of the
**total fixed and variable annual voted remuneration (even taking into account the proposed adjustment to compensate**
for the absence of an EBITDA target) and 70% of the total as voted by the 2020 General Meeting, including the long-term
remuneration under the 2020 plan.

**Annual fixed remuneration for 2020**

The fixed part of the gross annual remuneration due to the Chief Executive Officer amounts to €200,000 for the second half
of 2020. In an effort to align remuneration policies with those of the organisation's employees, the newly-appointed Chief
Executive Officer contributed to the collective effort and the fixed portion of his remuneration was reduced during the period
when the company was in short-time working in the fourth quarter of 2020. The amount of his gross remuneration paid was
reduced from €200,000 gross to €191,166 gross for the second half of 2020.

**Annual variable remuneration for 2020**

The basis for calculating the annual variable part of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration is 100% of his annual base
salary, reduced to the period of the second half of 2020; it was calculated on the basis of €200,000, representing 100% of
the annual fixed remuneration due for the second half of 2020. The ceiling is fixed at 120% of the fixed remuneration.

Financial objectives (50%):

   - consolidated net result for the year compared to the net result forecast in the budget (25%), at a constant exchange
rate and for the current scope of activities: Eurotunnel, Getlink, Europorte and ElecLink;

   - consolidated EBITDA target as announced to the market for 2020 (25%): given the unprecedented nature of the
situation caused by the Covid-19 epidemic and the lack of visibility, the Group withdrew its 2020 EBITDA target.

Operational objectives (40%):

   - effectiveness of operational and corporate integration; organisation of stakeholder relations (10%);

   - ElecLink: installation of the cable in the Tunnel and test phase for commissioning in 2021 (20%);

   - investor and analyst relations (10%).

CSR objectives (10%).

On 18 February 2021, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance of the Chief Executive Officer
by reference to the performance indicators above and made its recommendations to the Board of Directors.

With regard to the criterion of net profit achieved, the Committee stated that the level of achievement of the objective did
not reach 93.34% and that performance on this criterion did not generate any variable remuneration.


-----

With regard to the EBITDA criterion, the Committee noted that the 2020 EBITDA target, which had been communicated to
the market on the basis of assumptions that had not proved viable, given the public health crisis, and so it had been
withdrawn. Not being technically able to assess the performance of the executive officer in relation to this criterion, the
Committee exceptionally decided to propose to the Board of Directors that the 2020 EBITDA criterion relating to the 2020
short-term variable remuneration be replaced with a transparent and market-acknowledged relative share performance
criterion, by reference to the average performance - including dividends - of the Getlink SE ordinary share over the 2020
financial year, compared to the performance of the GPR Getlink Index.

This TSR (Total Shareholder Return) criterion, which the market has seen being used for several years in long-term incentive
plans, has the merit of transparency and it also makes it possible to reward the work of the executive officers in 2020 to get
through the crisis, by strictly aligning the interests of the executive with those of the shareholder and which is reflected in
the performance of the share in 2020 compared with its peers. Since 2018, the relative performance of the Getlink SE ordinary
share has been assessed in relation to the performance of the Group's sector index, the GPR Getlink Index. This index is
based on an international sector panel comprising the following companies: Aena SME SA, Aéroports de Paris, Atlantia S.p.A.,
DFDS A/S, Eiffage SA, Électricité de France SA, Engie SA, Ferrovial SA, Firstgroup PLC, Flughafen Zurich AG, Fraport AG,
National Grid PLC, Stagecoach Group PLC and Vinci SA.

Since the internal performance condition linked to EBITDA is not applicable, the Committee decided to propose to the Board
of Directors that it be replaced by an external performance condition based on the stock market performance of the
Getlink SE share (Total Shareholder Return) compared to the performance of its benchmark GPR Getlink Index over the year
2020, as follows:

**Payment rate (TSR criterion)**
TSR vs GPR Getlink Index TSR < Index [TSR > 1.2 x Index ]
Payment rate 0% 100%

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee decided to propose to the Board of Directors that this amendment be put
to the shareholders for a vote, albeit to a more limited extent than that initially foreseen for EBITDA, at 65%. The weight of
this criterion was reduced from 25% to 16% of the total variable remuneration allowed for the second half of 2020. Subject
to the acceptance of this amendment by the General Meeting of 28 April 2021, the annual variable remuneration determined
on these bases will be voted on by the General Meeting of shareholders "ex-post".

The Nomination and Remuneration committee reviewed the various aspects of the implementation of the Group's strategy:

With regard to the Chief Executive Officer’s integration at an operational and social level, the Board of Directors praised
the impressive integration of the Chief Executive Officer, his involvement, the remarkable results of the measures he
piloted to deal with the crisis, as well as the harmonious and efficient functioning of the "dissociated" tandem governance
structure since 1 July, and the relationship of trust and mutual respect established between the Chairman and the Chief
Executive Officer.

With regard to ElecLink, the Committee noted that the authorisation to pull the cable came in December 2020 due to
delays of the IGC so in the circumstances the criterion of the installation of the cable was inappropriate, but the
Committee accordingly proposed to the Board of Directors that it use its best judgement and take into consideration the
diligence of the Chief Executive Officer in the context of achieving this result and so acknowledge the achievement of
this objective.

With regard to investor relations, the Board of Directors took note of the work of the Chief Executive Officer and his
remarkable involvement.

With regard to the CSR objectives, as measured by the CSR index (10%), the Committee considered that, in the light of the
2020 results, through a significant improvement in the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to revenue and despite a weaker
performance on the absenteeism rate, the objective was achieved at 117.43%.

At its meeting on 24 February 2021, the Board of Directors assessed the performance of the Chief Executive Officer by
comparing the result obtained with the above target indicators. The Board of Directors took into consideration the very
exceptional circumstances of the second half of 2020 and took into account in its assessment of the Chief Executive Officer's
performance, the manner in which the crisis was managed with regard to the fundamental aspects of the health and safety
of the Group's employees, customers and subcontractors, the pursuit of the public service mission, the rigorous management
of costs and the implementation of appropriate measures for the strict management of resources and the protection of the
Group's assets.

Following the recommendations of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors, taking into
account the achievements noted, decided to set the variable part of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration for the second
half of the financial year ended 31 December 2020:

at €139,968, subject to the agreement of the General Meeting of 28 April 2021 on the replacement of the EBITDA criterion
by the TSR, or failing that;

at €107,468, if the general meeting of 28 April 2021 does not approve the replacement of the EBITDA criterion by the
TSR.

**2020 long-term variable remuneration**

By application of the remuneration policy approved by a vote at the General Meeting, the Board of Directors granted Yann
Leriche 15,000 performance shares under the 2020 plan, the fair value of which, established at €7.85 on the date of allocation
of the rights granted under the plan, was calculated by applying the Black & Scholes model for the valuation with nonmarket performance conditions and by applying the Monte Carlo model for the market performance condition.

The General Meeting of 30 April 2020 authorised a long-term incentive plan for the benefit of the Group's managers and
executives, including executive officers, of a total of 265,000 performance shares, compared with 1,500,000 in the previous
year. The final allocation of ordinary shares is based on the achievement of the three cumulative performance criteria identical
to those used by Getlink for the previous plans:

The external performance condition (the “TSR weighting”) would be based on the average performance including
dividends (TSR) of the Getlink SE ordinary share over a period of three years compared to the GPR Getlink Index. This
element determines 40% of the cumulative weighting of shares that can be granted. The final attribution of ordinary
shares linked to this condition will vary according to the degree of achievement of the objective, it being borne in mind
that:

   - should the TSR of the Getlink SE ordinary share be strictly less than the performance of the GPR Getlink Index over
the aforementioned period of three years, no shares will be granted; and

   - should the TSR of the Getlink SE ordinary share be equal to the performance of the GPR Getlink Index over the
aforementioned period of three years, 15% of the number that can be granted will be granted, with the whole being
capped at 40% of the number that can be granted.

The first **internal performance condition (the "EBITDA weighting") would be based on the company's economic**
performance, assessed by reference to the average EBITDA achievement rate over a three-year period covering the
financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022, at a constant exchange rate and on a like-for-like basis. It would determine 50% of
the cumulative weighting. The final allocation of the shares linked to this condition would vary according to the level of
achievement of the target, bearing in mind that:

   - in the event that the average 2020, 2021 and 2022 EBITDA achievement rate is strictly less than 100% of the average
EBITDA reported to the market by Getlink SE for the financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022, there would be no award;
and

   - in the event of an average 2020, 2021 and 2022 EBITDA achievement rate equal to or greater than 100% of the
average EBITDA reported to the market by Getlink SE for the financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022, 15% of the
attributable volume would be effectively allocated, with a maximum of 50%.

The second internal performance condition (the "CSR Weighting") would be based on the three-year performance
of the Group's composite CSR Index described above. It would determine 10% of the cumulative weighting.

The exact number of ordinary shares that will be acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period will depend
on the degree of achievement of the performance, it being borne in mind that:

    should the achievement rate of each criterion be less than 100%, there will be no right to ordinary shares,

    should the achievement rate be equal to or greater than 100%, the allocation ratio of the ordinary shares will
follow a progressive scale depending on the degree of achievement of the objectives,

    the allocation ratio of the ordinary shares will reach 39% of its potential if each criterion is equal to its
intermediate level (corresponding to an average weighted achievement of 105.75%), and

    the allocation ratio of the ordinary shares will reach 100% of its potential if each criterion exceeds its upper
level. In any case, if the weighted average rate of achievement is less than 112%, the allocation ratio of the
ordinary shares will not reach 100% of its potential.

**Supplementary defined contribution pension plan/death and disability insurance for 2020**

The Chief Executive Officer does not have a defined benefit pension plan. The Chief Executive Officer benefits from the
supplementary pension scheme available to all senior managers employed above the B remuneration bracket. This plan,
whose beneficiaries include people other than the Group’s executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. It is a defined
contribution plan, which would currently grant the Chief Executive Officer an estimated pension of €171 per year (non
commutable annuity), assuming i assuming retirement at the age of 65.

In 2020, employer contributions paid under this supplementary defined contribution pension scheme amounted to €6,582
out of a total of €97,127 (2019: €95,499) for all those concerned.

The Chief Executive Officer benefits from a basic and a complementary pension scheme. In 2020, contributions paid under
this complementary pension scheme amounted to €14,439 for the employee portion and €23,268 for the employer portion.

The Chief Executive Officer is covered by the death and disabilities scheme, as well as by the personal accident policy for
Getlink SE employees.

**Remuneration owed to the Chairman for the second half of 2020**

The remuneration due to the Chairman, Jacques Gounon, for the second half of 2020 consisted of fixed annual remuneration
and a continuing benefit package (benefits in kind/director's remuneration/pension and death and disabilities benefits).

**Annual fixed remuneration**

The Chairman's fixed remuneration due for the second half of 2020 amounted to €300,000 gross.

**Benefits in kind/director's remuneration**

For the second half of the 2020 financial year, the Chairman continued to benefit from the allowance for the use of a personal
vehicle described in section 5.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document, which represents an annual amount of €11,400
(2019: €11,400).

He has received, in respect of his office as Director, director’s remuneration in the same manner as the other members of
the Board of Directors, as indicated in section 5.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Retirement and death and disabilities benefits**

The Chairman, Jacques Gounon, asserted his rights to the basic and complementary pension schemes in August 2020. To
date, pension rights are still being reconstituted; the Chairman does not benefit from a defined benefit pension scheme. He
benefits from the supplementary pension scheme open to all executives above the B tranche of remuneration. The Chairman
is covered by the death and disabilities insurance and the personal accident policy for Getlink SE employees detailed in
section 5.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Remuneration owed to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020**

In the context of the implementation of the separation of the roles of chairman and CEO in 2020, at its meeting on 6 March
2020 the Board of Directors of Getlink SE abolished the role of Deputy Chief Executive Officer and therefore ended François
Gauthey’s term of office as Deputy Chief Executive Officer with effect from 15 March 2020.

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020 was as follows:

**Remuneration in 2020**

Annual fixed remuneration for 2020

The fixed part of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer's gross annual remuneration remained at €400,000 paid pro rata for the
actual term of office in 2020 i.e. €82,796.

Annual variable remuneration for 2020

The Board of Directors, having taken note of the temporary and transitional nature of the term of office of the Deputy Chief
Executive Officer, which was due to cease in March 2020, and of the correspondingly restricted ability of the Deputy Chief
Executive Officer to influence the performance of the company over such a short period of time, decided not to provide for
a variable portion of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer's annual remuneration for 2020.

François Gauthey did not receive any annual variable remuneration for his 2020 corporate office.

Long-term remuneration

In accordance with article 25-5-1 of the Afep/Medef Code, which stipulates that an executive officer may not be granted
stock options or performance shares upon his departure, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer did not receive any long-term
remuneration instruments under the 2020 plan.

Benefits in kind for 2020

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer benefited from a company car, representing a benefit in kind of €587.


-----

Supplementary defined contribution pension plan/death and disability insurance for 2020

The Deputy Chief Executive Officer did not have a defined benefit pension plan. He benefited from the same supplementary
pension plan offered to all senior managers above the B remuneration bracket. This plan, whose beneficiaries extend beyond
the Group’s executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. It is a defined contribution plan which at 15 March 2020 would
have granted the Deputy Chief Executive Officer an estimated pension of €2,177 per year (non-commutable annuity),
assuming retirement at the age of 65 and on the basis of the accumulated savings as at 31 December 2019. The Deputy
Chief Executive Officer was covered by the death and disability insurance and personal accident policies available to
Getlink SE employees.

**End of office**

François Gauthey returned to his salaried position as Chief Financial Officer on 16 March 2020.

Financial conditions relating to the end of François Gauthey's term of office

The Board of Directors determined in accordance with the remuneration policy applicable to the executive officers.

Payments due at the end of the term of office:

François Gauthey did not receive any payment for leaving office.

Preference and performance shares granted under the corporate mandate:

In previous years, in his capacity as Deputy Chief Executive Officer, François Gauthey had benefited from the allocation of
preference and/or performance shares, entirely subject to performance and presence conditions.

François Gauthey had been granted rights under the 2018 and 2019 LTI plans; these allocations were previously presented
and approved during the votes on the remuneration of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer at the last two General Meetings.

As mentioned in the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting, the Board of Directors decided that the definitive
allocation of these shares to François Gauthey would be made on the basis of (i) the fulfilment of the performance conditions
applicable to the plans in question on the dates initially set and (ii) François Gauthey's actual presence within the Group
during the period of assessment of the performance conditions.

The number of performance shares granted to François Gauthey under the 2018 and 2019 LTI plans has been revised pro
rata to take into account his actual presence during the performance assessment periods of the plans whose vesting periods
had expired i.e. a maximum, before application of performance conditions, of 88,110 ordinary shares (instead of 120,000
shares initially) under the 2018 plan and 54,123 ordinary shares (instead of 135,000 shares initially) under the 2019 plan.

**End of the employment contract**

François Gauthey's employment contract as Chief Financial Officer, which was reactivated on 16 March 2020, ended on 30
November 2020.

In connection with the termination of his employment contract, François Gauthey received the statutory and contractual
termination indemnities provided for in his employment contract, i.e. half a month's salary for each month of effective
presence, up to a maximum of eight months' salary. Getlink waived the application of the non-competition clause as
permitted for in François Gauthey's employment contract.

**Remuneration of Board members in 2020**

The Directors of Getlink SE receive remuneration, formerly called attendance fees.

The maximum total amount of attendance fees was raised from €825,000, as previously set by the shareholders’ Combined
General Meeting of 27 April 2017, to €950,000 as set by the General Meeting of 30 April 2020.

The breakdown of attendance fees was reviewed by the Board in 2018, on the recommendation of the Remuneration
Committee, following on from the General Meeting of 18 April 2018 (which increased the number of Board members from
11 to 15), in a way that respects the maximum total amount set by the General Meeting while ensuring that this remuneration
is predominantly variable in accordance with recommendation 20.1 of the Afep/Medef Code.

With a view to adjusting the directors’ remuneration package to the size of the Board of Directors and in order to be able to
attract international profiles as part of the Board of Directors' rotation plan, it was proposed to the General Meeting of 30
April 2020, which voted in favour of the resolution, that a maximum amount of €950,000 be allocated per financial year to
the Directors as remuneration for their activities.

Nevertheless, given the context of the public health crisis, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nomination
and Remuneration Committee, decided not to readjust the methods for allocating the overall budget upwards and so in
2020 they remained at the 2018 reduced base.


-----

Directors’ remuneration consists of a fixed part and a variable part proportionate to the attendance of Directors at meetings
of the Board of Directors and of its committees, with an enhancement for the chairs of Board committees. Since 2018, the
fixed part has been reduced from €1,950 to €1,700 per month (more for Committee chairs) and the variable part has been
reduced as follows:

physical presence at a Board meeting reduced from €2,250 to €2,000 per meeting;

increase of €500 if physical attendance involves crossing a border.

In the context of the 2020 public health crisis, the members of the Board of Directors joined the efforts of management,
employees and shareholders, and the fixed part of directors' remuneration was reduced by 10% during the second quarter
of 2020, with an increased frequency of meetings and reduced remuneration for their participation due to the impossibility
of holding face-to-face meetings. In fact, during the second Covid-19 wave, the reduction to €800 of the attendance fee for
Board meetings attended by telephone or video conference was suspended since meetings could only be held by video
conference due to the lockdown measures and travel restrictions prohibiting the movement of certain directors and in the
interests of equality between all members of the Board of Directors.

The total amount of directors’ remuneration due by Getlink SE to its Directors for the 2020 financial year is €736,950 (2019:
€733,050), as detailed in the table below:

**2020** **2019**

1 Amounts due for the year before deductions at source and social charges.
2 Amounts paid during the year after waiver of directors' fees in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, deductions at source and social charges.

Non-executive directors do not receive any other form of remuneration from Getlink.

Executive officers and senior management do not receive remuneration for their terms of office in other companies in
the Group.

In addition, members of the Board of Getlink SE benefit from directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, as do all officers who
are individuals.

**5.1.3** **ALIGNMENT OF REMUNERATION**

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee referred to various analyses, one of which was a comparative analysis
prepared by an independent firm (Mercer) specialising in executive remuneration studies. That study was designed to
measure the relative remuneration of the Chairman and of the Chief Executive Officer compared to their peers. It focused on
the remuneration of chairmen and chief executive officers and of chief executive officers of the inter-sectoral panel of the
French SBF 120 companies below, with characteristics in common with the Group in terms of headcount and revenue: Altran
Technologies, Bic, Biomérieux, CGG, Edenred, Eramet, Eurofins Scientific, Eutelsat communications, Imerys, Ingenico, Ipsen,
JC Decaux, Métropole TV (M6), Quadient (ex-Neopost), Rémy Cointreau, Seb, Tarkett, TF1, Ubisoft Entertainment, Vallourec
and Vicat. An additional study on a larger sample was carried out to assess the remuneration of the non-executive Chairman.


-----

The Chief Executive Officer Yann Leriche’s annual fixed remuneration for 2020 (€400,000 for a full year) is below the lowest
quartile; his target (€400,000) and maximum (€440,000) potential annual variable remuneration are below the lowest quartile
(€549,200).

In view of the 2020 and 2021 context (public health crisis and Brexit) the representative role of the Chairman in addition to
the operational role of the new Chief Executive Officer is aligned with market practices for comparable levels of capitalisation,
this level of remuneration being justified during the transition period with the Chief Executive Officer.

Furthermore, the combined remuneration of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer is between the first quartile and
the median of the remuneration panel for a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of comparable companies.

**Equality ratios established between the level of remuneration of executive officers and the average and median**
**remuneration of the company’s employees**

In accordance with the provisions of Order 2019-1234 of 27 November 2019 transposing EU Directive 2017/828, all
companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market must set out in the corporate governance report
the ratios between:

the level of remuneration of each of the executive officers; and

the average and median remuneration on a full-time equivalent basis of the company’s employees.

These equality ratios have been calculated in accordance with the principles explained below and in line with the guideline
recommendations defined by Afep.

**Elements of remuneration included**

The ratios presented below have been calculated on the basis of the elements of remuneration paid or awarded during the
financial year.

Remuneration elements taken into account in the numerator: executive officers

the fixed remuneration paid during each financial year;

the variable remuneration paid during each financial year;

remuneration related to the role of director paid during each financial year;

benefits in kind paid during each financial year; and

long-term share-based remuneration instruments granted during each financial year, taken into account on the grant
date and at their IFRS grant value.


Remuneration elements taken into account in the denominator: employees continuously present from 1 January to
31 December of each year

In accordance with the principle adopted for the elements of remuneration of executive officers, the elements of
remuneration paid (gross annual remuneration) are considered and any free shares are taken into account on the grant date
and at their IFRS grant value.

**Scope of calculation of ratios**

The law applies only to the employees of the French listed company that prepares the corporate governance report
(Getlink SE) and not to all employees of the French companies of the Group or of the Group itself.

The Board of Directors considered that the ratio established by taking into account only the employees of the French listed
company is of little relevance for Getlink SE, which has very few employees in relation to the total workforce in France. The
Board decided to supplement the information provided in accordance with the recommendations of the Afep/Medef Code
by disclosing the hypothetical calculation of all French entities including the entities of the Europorte segment and, since
this is a binational company, also to publish the ratio including the employees within the scope of the representative activity
in the United Kingdom, i.e. Eurotunnel employees on the British side.

In the interests of transparency and representativeness, on a voluntary basis, the scope used to determine the ratios has
been extended to cover all Group entities (French and foreign Group companies, with the exception of ElecLink). The scope
considered is representative of the Getlink Group’s workforce and activities in France, both in the Tunnel Concessionaire
business and in the Europorte rail freight business.

**Presentation of the ratios for the five most recent financial years**

This presentation was made in accordance with the terms of French law no. 2019-486 of 22 May 2019 relating to the growth
and transformation of companies, known as the “PACTE” Law and Order no. 2019-1234 of 27 November 2019. It may be
subject to change in order to ensure that Getlink SE remains compliant, in particular in the event of any subsequent
clarifications and official positions that may be published.

The ratios are presented by role, taking into account the arrival in 2020 of a new Chief Executive Officer and the separation
of the roles of Chairman (Jacques Gounon) and Chief Executive Officer (Yann Leriche) as of July and the end of the term of
office of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer (François Gauthey).

Accordingly, the equity ratios for each function performed for the year 2020 are presented: for the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.

Chairman - - - - 4

Chief Executive Officer - - - - 3

There is a strong variation in the ratios calculated with those calculated for previous years, with significantly lower ratios.
Several factors related to the change in governance and the context of the year may explain this change:

The LTI allotment policy was thoroughly revised in 2020 and the overall budget voted (265,000 free share rights in 2020
under the LTI plan compared to 1,500,000 conditional rights in 2019), as well as the number of beneficiaries (26 in 2020
compared to 55 in 2019) were sharply reduced, which has a major impact on the remuneration levels of executive officers
and also of a very large majority of senior executives.

As a result of the changes in governance, 2020 is characterised by the absence of an LTI grant for the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and for the Chairman (the two consecutive terms of office held by Jacques Gounon in 2020), as well as
for the outgoing Deputy Chief Executive Officer. The outgoing Deputy Chief Executive Officer did not receive a variable
bonus in 2020 due to the end of his role within the Group and nor did the new Chief Executive Officer who likewise did
not receive any variable remuneration in 2020, due to his arrival in office.

In the light of the impact of the public health crisis on financial and stock market performance, the value at grant of free
share rights was more than 18% lower than the value recorded in 2019 which again reduces the remuneration included
in the comparison.

As a gesture of solidarity and in order to participate in the collective effort to find savings and reduce costs imposed by
the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the business, it should also be noted that more than 70% of senior management
(including executive officers) have agreed to a reduction in their 2020 remuneration by a minimum of 10%.

As a result, in addition to the decrease in the remuneration of the various executive officers and the changes in governance
that have been made, the average and median remuneration levels taken into account have also decreased significantly,
particularly when the Getlink SE entity is viewed individually.

Consequently, although the levels observed for the various ratios in 2020 are difficult to compare with previous levels, they
nevertheless reflect a strengthening of the moderation of executive pay.

**5.1.4** **TOTAL AMOUNT SET ASIDE OR OTHERWISE RECOGNISED BY GETLINK SE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY FOR**

Neither Jacques Gounon nor Yann Leriche benefited from any specific retirement benefits.

**5.4** **SENIOR MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION**

As stated in chapter 6 of this Universal Registration Document, Getlink’s remuneration policy is based on fair and transparent
remuneration to ensure complete consistency between individual goals and business objectives. Getlink’s strategy is also to
share its success with its team members in order to involve them in the Group’s growth. The Group’s remuneration policy
aims to promote the achievement of economic, social and market performance, enhance the growth of skills, meet and
outperform objectives and increase the commitment of team members and managers in the long term, while strengthening
employee ownership.

The members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee ensure consistency between the policy applied to executive
officers and that applied to the senior managers of the Group. The members of the Nomination and Remuneration
Committee also examine the alignment of the senior managers’ remuneration principles.

The remuneration of the chief operating officers, which is determined by general management, is made up of fixed annual
remuneration supplemented by a motivational variable part, the criteria for which are largely based on the Group’s economic
performance, as is the case with the variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer. The variable financial part is
accompanied by qualitative criteria to assess individual performance.

Members of the Executive Committee also receive remuneration made up of a fixed part, the amount of which is proportional
to each one’s responsibilities, supplemented by a variable part whose quantitative criteria depend on the Group’s results in
order to improve the sense of solidarity.

In 2020, because of the effect of the public health crisis on activity, Getlink has set up, both on the British side and the French
side:

in the United Kingdom, a furlough mechanism; and

in France, a short-time working scheme firstly between April and June 2020 on the one hand and subsequently since
5 October 2020.

All the Group's functions, both operational and support, have played their part.

In solidarity with the collective effort and in order to contribute to the necessary cost reduction imposed by the situation, it
was at the same time proposed to the Group's senior managers that they accept a temporary reduction in their fixed
remuneration of at least 10% over several months of the year (in the second and fourth quarters). This call was taken up by
more than 70% of the senior managers approached.

**6.1** **NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT**

As an innovative railway company and responsible infrastructure manager, Getlink has been committed from the outset to
a policy of social responsibility designed to reconcile financial and non-financial performance along principles of continuous
improvement.

The Group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy aligns with respect for fundamental rights as defined in major
international principles.

With the objective of transparency and openness, particularly towards investors and shareholders, Getlink regularly responds
to requests concerning its non-financial performance. That performance is recognised and rewarded by being included in
the most significant international CSR indices, including at the end of 2020:

The STOXX Global ESG Leaders indices, which rank leading international companies in environmental, social policy and
governance issues, in particular EURO STOXX Sustainability and Stoxx Europe Sustainability.

The Gaia Index, the mid-cap SRI index developed by IDMidCaps and EthiFinance.

The MSCI ESG indices, in particular MSCI Europe ESG Leaders and MSCI World ESG Leaders Net Return.

The FTSE4Good indices, which measure the performance of companies with outstanding commitment to environmental,
social and governance issues.

The ISS ESG Prime label.

Euronext Low Carbon 100 Europe®: Getlink incorporated this index in December 2015. It measures the performance of
the 100 largest European companies with the lowest CO2 emissions in their respective sectors.

In 2020, Getlink joined the new Euronext Eurozone ESG Large 80 index, which includes 80 companies selected for their
performance on social, environmental, governance and energy transition issues.

The Group also responds to the DJSI (Dow Jones Sustainability Index), Sustainalytics and the CDP.

The Group regularly publishes the rankings from these various indices. They can be seen on the “Our CSR commitments”[25]
pages on Getlink’s website.
This chapter 6 comprises the aspects that make up the non-financial performance statement prepared by the Board of
Directors on 24 February 2021 on the basis of the Order of 19 July 2017 and the Decree of 9 August 2017. This non-financial
performance statement, which is set out in detail in the table of cross-references annexed to this Universal Registration
Document, includes:

the presentation of the business model;

an analysis of the main CSR risks;

the policies applied and due diligence procedures; and

the results of the policies and performance indicators.

Getlink is a key player in transport infrastructures and international trade and a leader in eco-responsible transport. Getlink
has a long-term commitment to serve the public in the transport and infrastructure management industries to benefit all its
stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and the community. The Group’s stakeholder map is set out in
section 6.2.1 below; the business model and accompanying infographic are set out in section 1.1.3 of this Universal
Registration Document.

Making CSR a key part of the strategy and all the business’s activities enables Getlink to establish a dialogue with its
stakeholders, respond to their expectations and therefore reinforce its overall performance. By contributing to sustainable
development challenges, the business accepts its CSR responsibility in accordance with public policies.

Getlink has based its CSR policy on an understanding of the Group’s material challenges, taking its business sector, size,
location and the concerns of its customers, its employees and other stakeholders into consideration. The Group organises
its reporting according to its material challenges and within the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards
(section 6.10).

**6.2** **STAKEHOLDERS AND MATERIAL CHALLENGES**

**6.2.1** **STAKEHOLDER MAP**

Getlink strives to listen to the expectations of its stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, community
and so on) in order to adapt and respond to the Group’s transformation challenges against the backdrop of a constantly
changing environment.

In 2020, with a view to consolidating its commitments, the CSR department formalised a map of the Group's stakeholders.
A panel of more than 25 operating officers and managers was asked to carry out an exhaustive inventory of Getlink's
stakeholders. These stakeholders were then grouped into major categories, in respect of which the participants specified the
methods of dialogue and information implemented. In order to make it easier to read and create a sense of ownership by
all, a graphic of the mapping was then produced and published on the CSR pages of the Group's corporate website. This
mapping, which represents the ecosystem of the Group's stakeholders, complements the tools developed by Getlink to
sustain its action and thoughts in the field of CSR.

**6.2.2** **MATERIAL CHALLENGES**

Since 2015, Getlink has prepared a materiality analysis to identify and rank the Group's material challenges, based on its
business activities and its stakeholders’ expectations.

In 2019, mindful of the transformation in society and rapid changes to internal and external stakeholder expectations, the
Group updated its materiality analysis.

This analysis was conducted in three main stages by an independent third party:

Stage 1: Diagnosis and analysis: 57 challenges were identified through an internal and external document analysis and an
analysis of non-financial communications and trends in terms of reporting challenges and opportunities within
the transport and infrastructure management sector.

Stage 2: Identifying, adapting and scoring challenges by stakeholders; through interviews conducted by an independent
third party, 21 stakeholders, located in France and the United Kingdom, were questioned. The external
stakeholders who were interviewed are representative of the Getlink ecosystem: its main business partners,
shareholders or suppliers. They are experts in strategic topics as well as operational workers from the industry.
These interviews helped identify and list 23 material challenges for the Group.

Stage 3: Ranking challenges: to help understand and adopt the challenges, Getlink wanted to present its materiality
analysis in the form of a materiality matrix. This matrix reflects the importance of each material challenge for the
respondent stakeholders and the impact on the Group’s business. To ensure consistency, the impact analysis was
conducted based on the methodology developed for the Group for its risk analysis (ranking scale from 1 to 6,
from very low to major) to classify the impact and probability. The impact of each challenge is determined based
on the financial impact, the impact on reputation and the probability of risk associated with the challenge, based
on the rating from the Group’s risk analysis.


-----

The 23 material challenges were grouped into five themes presented in the materiality matrix and three levels of priority for
the Group: priority (9 challenges), important (10 challenges) and moderate (4 challenges).

**Illustration of the Group’s materiality matrix:**

Some challenges remain intangible and are subject to high expectations by stakeholders such as employee **health and**
**safety and the** **safety and security of infrastructure, transport, freight and passengers. Various risk mitigation systems**
associated with these challenges have been implemented, but their potential impact on the Group remains significant. Other
challenges have come to the fore under the pressure of external stakeholders or major current affairs. The **increasing**
**complexity of the regulatory landscape** reflects uncertainties linked to Brexit. **Quality of service and customer**
**experience are increasingly pressing.** **Energy transition and combating climate change are crucial challenges for**
stakeholders, and cover several aspects: energy consumption and the use of renewable energy. The challenge of
**environmental protection also includes protecting natural areas, waste management and the circular economy. Faced with**
the challenges of renewing its workforce, recruiting experts in industries under pressure, and despite a dynamic policy in
recent years, themes linked to human resources have thus been revised upwards by the Group. This is particularly the case
for **attractiveness and career management** and the need to **modernise social dialogue (labour relations).** **Gender**
**equality is now also a major challenge that carries high expectations from both external and internal stakeholders. The**
Group’s desire to be a regional leader in several areas (local employment, community and education, helping to develop
local start-ups) underlines the importance of a local foothold **(territorial anchorage). In relation with these different**
challenges, the need for constructive dialogue with States, local public authorities and regulators has also increased.


-----

**6.2.3** **OVERLAP BETWEEN MATERIAL CHALLENGES AND THE MAIN CSR RISKS**

Getlink compared material challenges identified in this way with the main CSR risks, identified as part of the Group’s annual
risk review, which are presented in chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document. For each risk, the review considered
its potential impact, its probability of occurrence and the associated level of control. The most significant specific risks
identified are those considered to be most crucial or to have the highest net materiality. The methodology for identifying
and ranking risks is set out in section 3.4.2 of this Universal Registration Document.

This cross-analysis of the material challenges and the principal non-financial risks highlights different priority workstreams

that relate directly to Getlink’s core business. The most significant risks are identified in the table below by the symbol
and presented in chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document. Risks having a CSR impact are identified by the following
pictogram: 🙒.

Moreover, each time that a material challenge is covered by a significant risk identified in chapter 3 of this Universal
Registration Document and the mitigation measures and actions deployed are explained therein a reference is provided to
the chapter in question.

In 2019, Getlink also identified the 10 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that best reflect its most material challenges
out of the 17 SDGs defined by the UN. These elements will supplement the updating of the Group’s CSR strategy in 2021
and will drive performance. These 10 SDGs, compared with the Group’s material challenges, are presented below and referred

**6.3** **ACTIVE GOVERNANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH**

From the outset, the company’s corporate governance has been underpinned by strong values which ensure cohesion and
guarantee its future and development. The Group’s management bodies are presented in chapter 4 of this Universal
Registration Document.

**Skills relating to economic, environmental and social impacts**

The Group’s strategic CSR commitments and their implementation are presented to the Ethics and CSR Committee and the
Board of Directors.

The composition of the Board of Directors reflects the commitment to diversity and complementary skills to benefit corporate
strategy. Board members and members of specialised committees are selected based on a skills matrix (presented in
chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document) which can be used to identify recognition of skills relating to economic,
environmental and social impacts through “CSR governance”, “human resources” and “risk management” criteria. Specifically,
in terms of the CSR skills of the current board members:

Patricia Hewitt worked for Age Concern (the largest charity in Great Britain working with the elderly), and then she acted
as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and as Minister for Women from 2001 to 2005, before being Secretary of
State for Health from 2005 to 2007.

Bertrand Badré is a member of The One Planet Lab, a consultative group steered by the French government to contribute
to the One Planet Summits proposing novel solutions for international cooperation. He was Chief Financial Officer at the
World Bank and has represented the organisation at the G7, G20 and the Council of Financial Stability. Bertrand Badré
has contributed significantly to the World Bank’s discussions on development finance. Bertrand Badré is known for his
commitment to implementing sustainable development goals through greater involvement of the private sector. He
created the Blue like an Orange Sustainable Capital investment fund, which targets investment in innovative economic
projects in developing countries.

Sharon Flood chaired the audit and risk and the CSR committees of Network Rail, of which she was a director for more
than five years. She is currently a member of the Board of Pets at Home Plc, the leading UK pet care company.

Corinne Bach is co-chair of Carbometrix, a company specialising in building a benchmark of corporate greenhouse gas
emissions using artificial intelligence.

Tim Yeo was chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee from 1983 to 2015; he was Minister for the
Environment and Countryside from 1990 to 1994, then Shadow Cabinet member between 1998 and 2005, notably for
Trade and Industry and the Environment and Transport. Tim Yeo was chairman of the Sheffield University Energy 2050
Industrial Advisory Board. He was also chairman of AFC Energy PLC from 2006 to 2017 and Founding President of
“Children’s Trust”, a charity organisation which manages a hospital for disabled children. In September 2020, he was
appointed Chairman of Powerhouse Energy Group plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange Alternative
Investment Market (AIM) and a leader in low-cost energy recovery in the waste management sector.

At the date of this Universal Registration Document, employees are represented on the Getlink SE Board of Directors by
two salaried directors: Stéphane Sauvage and Philippe Vanderbec. The general meeting of 30 April 2020 voted to amend
the statutes to allow for an extension of the representation arrangements to include the possibility of appointing a third
director, to represent employees with a British employment contract.

The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems. It takes note of the
risk mapping including CSR risks and ensures that these systems are well-developed and controlled. It examines how they
are deployed and the implementation of corrective actions in the event of significant shortcomings or anomalies.

**Ethics and CSR Committee**

In 2020, the Corporate Committee was renamed the Ethics and CSR Committee. It supervises and ensures the dissemination
of ethical principles. The overall purpose of Getlink's Ethics and CSR Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in
monitoring corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ethical issues so that Getlink can best anticipate the opportunities,
challenges and risks associated with them. The Ethics and CSR Committee reports to the Board of Directors on the
performance of its duties and makes recommendations on Getlink's ethics and CSR policy and actions.

The purpose of the Ethics and CSR Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in ensuring that the Group anticipates the
non-financial challenges, opportunities and risks associated with its business to the best of its ability in order to promote
responsible and harmonious long-term value creation. The committee will issue recommendations on the Group's policy
and achievements in this area. The Committee pays particular attention to the principles of action, policies and practices
implemented by Getlink in the following areas: social, (with respect to the employees of Getlink and its subsidiaries);
environmental, (relating to Getlink's direct activities, the activities of its subsidiaries); societal and ethical.


-----

More specifically, the Committee's purpose is: to ensure that CSR issues are taken into account in the definition of Getlink's
strategy, examine CSR opportunities and risks related to Getlink's activities, review policies in these areas, as well as the
objectives set and results achieved, more specifically in terms of investment, ensure that merger/acquisition processes
include the performance of CSR due diligence, ensure that non-financial reporting, evaluation and control systems are in
place to enable Getlink to produce reliable non-financial information, review the non-financial information published by
Getlink in its annual report, review and monitor the ratings obtained from non-financial agencies, and review the monitoring
and implementation of applicable regulations in these areas.

In terms of the environment, the Committee’s purpose is to regularly review the environmental performance of the company
and the Group, receive assurance about the Group's actions towards the environment and climate and the strategic
orientations designed to promote environmental management, preserve natural resources and limit the impact of the
company's and the Group's activities on the environment.

In terms of ethics, the Committee ensures the steering of the ethical system. Its role mainly consists of:

ensuring the implementation of a framework for the ethical system and the associated procedures;

ensuring the implementation of actions to promote the presentation, understanding and implementation of the Group's
ethics system, particularly in the area of the fight against corruption;

ensuring that a network of ethics leads is set up within the Group; and

receiving assurance that training and awareness-raising activities are carried out by the operational entities.

The detailed purpose, composition and activity of the Ethics and CSR Committee are presented in section 4.2.5.c of this
Universal Registration Document.

**Environment and Climate Lead Director**

In order to support the company to move towards a lower carbon economy, the Board of Directors of Getlink SE has
introduced the possibility of appointing an Environment and Climate Lead Director.

The role of the Environment and Climate Lead Director will be to ensure that the Board of Directors is able to make informed
decisions on a fair transition and encourage a long-term transformational approach to climate change issues.

The Environment and Climate Lead Director will be able to transparently monitor the Group's progress in relation to the
transition programme set by the Board of Directors. To this end, the Lead Director for Environment and Climate will be able
in particular to:

ensure that the Board of Directors is fully informed of the progress of the workstreams in accordance with the defined
trajectory and in relation to critical milestones, to enable the business to prepare itself on different time scales;

provide regular, cross-functional updates on science, innovation, peer initiatives and regulations to the Ethics and CSR
Committee;

invite experts, in the Ethics and CSR Committee or in the full meeting of the Board of Directors, to discuss specific issues,
to strengthen collective knowledge; and

consider the creation of an independent stakeholder panel to inform Board decisions.

The Board of Directors has appointed the Chairman of the Ethics and CSR Committee as the Environment and Climate Lead
Director.

**Operational governance**

The compliance department steers the implementation of compliance action plans. The General Secretary of the Board of
Directors is the ethics lead. A network of representatives has been deployed and leads the action plan through working
groups. ElecLink is included in this network and has undertaken the relevant training.

In 2020, the CSR team became part of the Group's administrative and financial department. It has worked to strengthen the
overall approach, its clarity and impact by focusing on all CSR areas in relation to ISO 26000. In-depth work on the definition
of the Group's CSR strategy has been initiated and should be completed in 2021. By prioritising its actions, the Group has
continued its work to strengthen its real and perceived CSR performance, despite a particularly difficult public health and
economic context.

**The Group’s CSR commitment: a key part of its corporate strategy**

The Board of Directors administers the company in accordance with the company's interests, taking into consideration the
social and environmental challenges of its activity.

Over the years, the Group’s CSR commitment has become an integral part of its corporate strategy: Group executives,
through performance share grant plans, and executive officers, through their annual bonus, have direct responsibility over
CSR challenges: the CSR composite index is used to calculate 10% of the annual variable remuneration.

Operational action plans include CSR criteria. The CSR objectives are defined each year, and they are included in the
objectives assigned to the directors and the heads of various Group entities. They are monitored and assessed during
individual annual reviews.


-----

In 2015, the Nominations Committee decided to create a stable, relevant and balanced CSR performance composite index:
the Group asked an external consultancy firm to create a benchmark for the business practices of CAC 40 companies, and
then conducted a qualitative study with its internal and external stakeholders. This initiative helped identify four themes
directly linked to the Group’s activities, which form part of the most material challenges: health/safety, labour relations,
greenhouse gas emissions and customer satisfaction. For each of these areas, indicators and targets were established so as
to calculate an achievement rate with respect to the composite index, according to the objectives set for each area.

The Board of Directors has decided to include the 2021 performance action plan, which has the 2023 targets, in the CSR
strategy review cycle. Long-term incentive plans are subject to performance criteria to be met over a period of three years,
in line with the 2023 CSR targets.

The Board of Directors has decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting of 28 April 2021 that the CSR criteria usually
used in long-term incentive plans be amended so as to align Getlink's social, societal and environmental ambitions for 2023
with the company's day-to-day operations:

One of the internal performance conditions (the "Climate Weighting") would be based on the achievement of the
objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15% in 2023 compared to 2019; in the event that the rate of
achievement of the objective is strictly less than 100%, there will be no allocation; and in the event that the rate of
achievement of the objective is equal to or greater than 100%, 15% of the allocable volume would be effectively allocated,
with a ceiling of 15%. It would condition 15% of the cumulative weighting.

A further internal performance condition (the "CSR Weighting") of up to 10% of the cumulative weighting would be
based on the achievement of the following four objectives:

   - safety: safety training objective of more than 30 hours on average per person;

   - equality between men and women: recruitment of more than 40% of each gender;

   - social climate;

   - quality of service assessed in relation to the results of satisfaction surveys, the number of complaints and the
positioning of Twitter sentiment.

By increasing the weight of CSR criteria from 10% in previous plans to 25% in this plan, this process helps ensure that there
is alignment between corporate strategy and operational deployment.

CSR operational management has adopted a network-style approach. The CSR reporting process has demonstrated the
Group’s willingness to be transparent on these topics for more than 10 years. Ethics underpin all management and
operational actions. The Ethics Charter is a reference text to inspire team members’ decisions, guide their day-to-day actions
and allow them to build stakeholder trust each day, something which is a major source of value creation for the Group.

**6.4** **GOVERNANCE AND RELIABILITY OF OPERATIONS**

**6.4.1** **TRAFFIC FLOW WITHIN THE TERMINAL AND IN THE TUNNEL**

Traffic flow within the terminals and in the Tunnel was identified as a priority material challenge by the
Group’s internal and external stakeholders.

This challenge is linked to the Group significant specific risk “Border controls affecting the handling of traffic
flows”, which is presented in chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document.

**6.4.2** **PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF ROLLING STOCK, EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE**

**A CRUCIAL PRIORITY FOR THE GROUP**

The performance and reliability of rolling stock, equipment and infrastructure were identified by
stakeholders as a priority material challenge for the Group.

These risks, having been identified as significant specific risks for the Group, are presented in chapter 3 of
this Universal Registration Document.


-----

**6.4.3** **PROTECTING THE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND DATA**

Protecting the information system and data was identified by stakeholders as a priority material challenge
for the Group.

With regard to the confidentiality of personal data, particularly in the context of the General Data Protection
Regulations (GDPR), the Group must provide its clients and stakeholders with the necessary level of
protection of their data.

Getlink has established several procedures and policies for the protection of personal data of employees, customers,
suppliers and third parties. The "Personal Data Protection Policy", established in 2016, has been reviewed in line with the
GDPR.

The Group has put in place mitigation measures to reduce the impact, including:

a Group legal policy has been published and circulated;

appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO);

enhanced communication with teams: regular training of key personnel (data protection representatives - DPRs) in the
protection of personal data, an online training module available to all employees, a dedicated intranet page on the
subject of personal data, containing compliance documents and tools for employees; and

a data processing register; and a system for reporting situations of non-compliance.

A system of legal monitoring of the register is in place.

The “cyber attacks” risk has been identified as a significant specific risk. This risk is set out in chapter 3 of this Universal
Registration Document.

**6.4.4** **DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATION**

Group activities take place in a constantly changing environment. The Group must anticipate these changes, identify and
integrate the required technological changes to stay competitive, maintain a high level of performance and operational
excellence, and respond to the needs and demand of its customers, and more generally all stakeholders.

Innovation development has been identified by stakeholders as a priority material challenge. Equipment and service changes
and poor change management have been identified as significant specific risks and are presented in chapter 3 of this
Universal Registration Document.

**6.4.5** **INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY AND SECURITY**

Infrastructure safety and security were identified by Group stakeholders as a priority material challenge. The risks of a major
fire in the Tunnel and terrorist attacks targeting the Fixed Link are significant specific risks presented in chapter 3 of this
Universal Registration Document.

Safety and security are part of the very design of the Tunnel, as indicated in section 1.2 of this Universal Registration
Document. In addition, as indicated in chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document, the Treaty of Canterbury
established the IGC and its Safety Authority to monitor the relevance and implementation of safety rules and practices
applicable to the Fixed Link, examine reports about any incident affecting safety and carry out investigations.


-----

In order to foresee and control the potential impacts of safety and security on its activity, Getlink has implemented a control
system, different policies and specific actions, including:

regularly reviewed formal risk analyses, and measures applied and distributed to all staff affected by the activity; and

safety policies, which set out the provisions relating to managing health, safety and the environment and which are part
of the continuous improvement and risk control approach. In fact, the safety management policy and the Safety
Management System (SMS) describe, in the case of Eurotunnel, all the risk control and mitigation measures for people
and the System. They place safety requirements ahead of all other objectives. The control of those requirements is based
on three interlinked factors: material and equipment, organisation and processes and people. Through its commitment
to carry out all its services in the highest safety, Europorte has also embarked on an approach to control its risks especially
in respect of operations, health and safety.

Different initiatives are continually involved in improving rail safety performance. These include:

maintaining an approach to improve safety culture and management commitment in the field;

enhancing safety communications to staff;

continuing safety training courses;

improving management and monitoring action plans linked to safety events; and

strengthening the sub-contractor monitoring and selection process.

Each year, Europorte implements action plans at national level covering the areas of staff safety, quality, the environment
and rail safety. These plans indicate the dates that actions are implemented, those responsible for each action and progress
made. The national action plan is implemented at the level of the various operational entities.

Since 2018, Europorte has established an initiative to take better account of organisational and human factors in the analysis
of events that could impact on rail safety.

Like safety, security has always been a major concern for the Group. It is defined as protection against external risks. Its aim
is to protect assets and people at its sites, i.e. detection and protection against external attacks on employees, partners and
sub-contractors, or damage to goods and infrastructures. As part of the Obligation for Economically Reasonable Progress in
view of Expected Gains (OPEREGA), Eurotunnel has funded fire training for First of Line Response (FLOR France) staff, who
patrol the Tunnel and manage evacuations in the event of an accident. This training is carried out by IFOPSE which has ISO
9001 and ISO 14001 version 2015 certification for its audit-consulting and fire safety activities, among others. IFOPSE, a
subsidiary of EDF, trains teams of specialists including from the Paris Fire Brigade (BSPP) and the Yvelines fire brigade (SDIS
78), and is the leading French company in fire safety training.

Security at the Coquelles site could be affected by attempted migrant intrusions depending on the prevailing geopolitical
situation. Since the 2015 migrant crisis, the Group has finished securing its site with appropriate systems, notably including
the installation of high-security fencing protected by detection cables as well as a building equipped with a heartbeat
detection system to detect the presence of humans on board trucks. Getlink also created a new central security office in
2017 on the French side of the Tunnel. This building covers 500m² and brings together all security services at the Coquelles
site and allows operators to monitor the 650-hectare site and the 37 kilometres of high-security fencing via video feedback
from operational cameras.

Eurotunnel is working closely with the relevant safety authorities. During 2020, despite the challenges posed by the
pandemic, eight internal safety audits were carried out, including on compliance with procedures, operational arrangements
and processes, risk assessment procedures and maintenance arrangements.

These measures have helped achieve and maintain the target of zero collisions and zero deaths in 2020.

**Results and targets**

**2018** **2019** **2020** **2021 target**

Number of collisions 0 0 0 0

Number of passenger deaths 0 0 0 0

This objective aims to measure the safety and security of the Group's infrastructure: these two indicators therefore relate
only to Eurotunnel.


-----

**6.4.6** **CSR GOVERNANCE**

This challenge was identified by stakeholders as important among the material challenges.

Getlink has a structured organisation and its governance explained in section 6.3 of this Universal Registration Document. In
2020 the CSR team joined the Group administration and financial department.

**6.4.7** **INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE**

The increasing complexity of the regulatory landscape, which is an important material challenge, is linked to
the “Regulatory Environment and Compliance” risk which has been identified as a significant specific risk
and is set out in chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document. The Brexit Transition Period ended on
31 December 2020, at which point new border formalities were introduced for all users of the Tunnel so
2020 was a particularly intense year in terms of monitoring regulatory developments.

**6.4.8** **RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING (PROCUREMENT)**

Responsible procurement was identified by Group stakeholders as an important material challenge.

Getlink wishes to build trust and loyalty with its suppliers and to ensure that they adopt a responsible attitude by offering
products and services that respect labour and environmental laws throughout their life cycle. Their production conditions
must strictly respect human beings and international rules regarding labour law, child welfare and health and safety.
Environmental, social and ethical criteria are evaluated during the Group supplier selection process.

As part of a voluntary responsible procurement initiative, Getlink signed a “Responsible Supplier Relations Charter” in January
2012. This charter includes 10 commitments for responsible purchasing, ensuring a genuine partnership between customers
and their suppliers with due regard to their respective rights and obligations. Its commitments include ensuring financial
fairness with its suppliers, respecting the principle of transparency, considering environmental challenges and ensuring that
the business is held locally accountable.

In 2020, the Group continued its efforts to consolidate its achievements and to develop, implement and maintain an effective
long-term responsible purchasing policy. To this end, a pilot campaign to clarify the CSR commitments of Eurotunnel's
suppliers in France was launched. This project, which has progressed more slowly because of the public health crisis, will
continue in 2021. Actions to prevent corruption in the purchasing process are described in section 3.4 of this Universal
Registration Document.

Strongly rooted and committed to its local environment, Eurotunnel carries out a substantial part of its procurement in the
region around the Tunnel site on the French side (the Nord and Pas-de-Calais départements) and in the county of Kent on
the United Kingdom side (CT, DA, ME and TN postcodes), thus enabling its local stakeholders to benefit from the value
creation generated by Eurotunnel's operations.

**6.4.9** **GOVERNANCE AND BUSINESS ETHICS**

Business ethics and human rights are part of the governance and business ethics challenge; they were identified as an
important challenge by the Group's internal and external stakeholders during the materiality analysis.

Getlink has been known for a strong culture based on the values of discipline, integrity and responsibility from the outset.
Establishing its operating performance based on strong ethics and compliance is an essential component of the business’s
strategy. Anti-corruption and ethical awareness actions (the Compliance Programme) are described in section 3.4 of this
Universal Registration Document.

In addition, the Group’s CSR approach is aligned with respect for fundamental rights as defined in the major international
principles: the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and the principles of the
United Nations Global Compact. As part of its commitment to the Global Compact, the Group fully adheres to its 10
fundamental principles and communicates annually on its CSR practices in an annual report entitled "Communication on
Progress" (COP). As of 2016, the Group's annual report has been qualified at the highest level of Global Compact
differentiation (GC Advanced), making Getlink one of 137 French companies and 663 companies worldwide that have
achieved this qualification in 2020 out of just over 1,320 signatories in France and more than 12,600 worldwide.


-----

In its Ethics and Behaviour Charter, Getlink reaffirms its commitment to the principles and values of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.

**6.4.10DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUP’S CULTURE**

Group culture has been identified by stakeholders as a limited material challenge. Internally it is not considered a risk but an
opportunity, to the extent that it brings employees together around shared values, history and a special adventure that has
shaped the company’s identity. This history draws on the great human adventure of the Tunnel, which on 6 May 1994
achieved a dream dating back nearly two centuries to link France and England. From the outset, the Group’s culture has been
a binational culture, building on this business history to develop. It is supported by a common vision and values, shared by
all Group employees. As a Group in constant motion, it aims to consolidate this vision as the Group grows and policies are
reviewed.

**6.5** **CUSTOMER SERVICE**
**A PRIORITY AND A STRATEGIC REQUIREMENT**

**6.5.1** **DEVELOPMENT OF INTRA-EUROPEAN ACTIVITY**

The development of activity within Europe has been identified as an important material challenge by stakeholders and is
linked to the contraction of markets and competitor pressure risk referred to section 3.1.1 of this Universal Registration
Document.

To develop rail traffic between the United Kingdom and continental Europe, Eurotunnel set up ETICA (Eurotunnel Incentive
for Capacity Additions), a system of financial aid for Railway Companies launching new rail services through the Tunnel.
ETICA is a voluntary support measure created at the sole initiative of Eurotunnel; it is based on a system of time-limited aid
open to all Railway Companies and has been the subject of consultation prior to publication.

**6.5.2** **SAFETY AND SECURITY OF FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TRANSPORT**

The safety and security of freight and passenger transport have been identified by Group stakeholders as priority material
challenges. The risk of a fire in the Tunnel, derailment and collision and threats linked to terrorist attacks are significant
specific risks and are set out in chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document.

Getlink has implemented a control system, different policies and/or actions to prevent and control potential impacts, which
are set out in section 1.2.4 of this Universal Registration Document.

With regard to the movement of passengers, the Treaty of Canterbury, presented in chapter 8 of this Universal Registration
Document, commits the two States to providing smooth traffic conditions through the implementation of juxtaposed identity
controls.

The Europorte subsidiaries apply SNCF and EPSF safety and security rules for goods transport as well as those relating to
infrastructure managers. They also have regular control procedures before the departure of main line trains. Regarding staff
skills:

specific training is provided for people involved in the transport of hazardous materials. The training is undergone every
four years; and

staff responsible for pre-departure or post train downtime controls receive initial training for these tasks and training
activities to refresh their skills have also been put in place. Staff awareness is also ensured through a
whistleblowing/suspicious activities charter and a safety best practices charter, specific to hazardous materials.


-----

**6.5.3** **QUALITY OF SERVICE AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE**

The quality of customer service and customer experience were identified as an important material challenge by the Group’s
internal and external stakeholders during the materiality analysis and correspond (specifically due to the United Kingdom’s
departure from the European Union) to the risk of border controls on the management of traffic flows identified as a
significant specific risk and set out in chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document.

Stakeholder expectations correspond perfectly to the priority placed by the Group on customer experience. Customer
satisfaction and retention is a core concern of Getlink’s development strategy. This is demonstrated by the digitalisation and
redesign of customer journeys. In its business policy, Europorte makes the satisfaction of its customers a major concern.
Offering a high level of service by responding to each of their specific requests and so building a special relationship with
each customer is a permanent commitment for each of Europorte’s subsidiaries.

In 2020, with a view to improving its agility, the organisation began to roll out its "One Team One Mission" programme. This
involves mobilising volunteer support teams, trained so that they can be deployed on site. More than a hundred employees
volunteered and received the appropriate training. These people are able to support activity on site while learning more
about the Group's businesses and job descriptions have been created. In July/August, support was provided to the Passenger
Shuttle Service and in October/November to the Truck Shuttle Service.

Alongside this, the Group continues to work towards improving the overall efficiency of the Shuttle Service, including by
focusing on border controls and improving load factors and the quality of information provided to customers.

In 2020, the evaluation of satisfaction has been impacted by the context of the pandemic. For example, mystery shoppers
were only able to carry out their tests over half the year (none carried out from March to June nor October to December).
Nevertheless, 61 visits, corresponding to 122 evaluations, were carried out in 2020. Very quickly, the Eurotunnel service
emerged in the eyes of customers as the safest mode of transport, due in particular to an integrated social distancing,
especially with regard to the passenger service.

Europorte has also put mitigation measures in place which aim to reduce or prevent the potential impacts of the risk of
improper management of customer complaints or an inadequate response, including:

simplification and standardisation of the locomotive fleet with a full service contract, to offer greater performance and
optimise maintenance costs;

contracts are monitored as part of a weekly review;

service quality performance indicators are included in each contract;

a customer satisfaction survey is conducted and the results and trends are presented to the Executive Committee each
year.

Objectives have been set to measure customer satisfaction for the Shuttle Service. These objectives are among those included
in the composite index. The satisfaction rate improved in 2020 and reached 90.5% (87.7% in 2019).

**Results and targets**

**2018** **2019** **2020** **2021 target**

✓ ✓ ✓ ✓
Customer satisfaction rate 93.0% 87.7% 90.5% 93.0%


Information verified to a reasonable level of assurance by the independent third party.

This customer satisfaction rate is calculated on the base of various satisfaction rates: the transporters’ satisfaction rate, the
truck drivers’ satisfaction rate and the commercial passengers’ satisfaction rate, all relating to Eurotunnel.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, Eurotunnel's teams have deployed a vast action plan to protect customers as effectively as
possible. The top priority has been to put in place effective and rapid measures to limit the health risk, including:

enhanced cleaning of the Club-Car carriages: seats, toilets, contact points and installation of hydroalcoholic gel
dispensers;

drivers are taken from their trucks in two groups in order to keep the least number of truck drivers in the buses and thus
comply with the rules of social distancing with markings on the floor in the buses;

rearrangement of the loading rate of the Shuttles in order to reduce the number of drivers in each Club-Car: 24 trucks
instead of 32;

daily disinfection of the buses and Club-Car carriages;

addition of a "Covid-19" section to the on-site team member Simply Better Together app; and

enhanced cleaning of buildings, on-site toilets and of the interior of the Shuttles.


-----

The health protection measures put in place by Eurotunnel at the beginning of the
Covid-19 pandemic were the subject of an on-site audit by AFNOR (the French
Standards Authority) in February 2021.

After the audit, AFNOR officially certified Eurotunnel on the verification of the Covid19 health protection measures implemented with the maximum score of 100% in both
France and the United Kingdom.

This exceptional rating reflects Eurotunnel's achievement of the maximum rating for
each of the audited aspects, including Truck Shuttle and Passenger Shuttle customer
journeys, actions by Covid-19 internal working groups, current processes and procedures, and comprehensive
documentation and internal and external communications.

The work undertaken by Eurotunnel's teams has thus been recognised for its effectiveness in ensuring the safety and
protection of customers and employees alike.

**6.6** **EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE**
**ENSURING EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR IMPROVED SOCIAL**
**PERFORMANCE**

The nature of the Group’s activities makes the Getlink’s men and women its main resource. Their commitment is the
prerequisite for all good performance. The Group encourages them by the attention it pays to their professional development
and by the importance it attaches to each of them, whatever their background, training or profession.

Based mainly in France and the United Kingdom, at the end of 2020 the Group employed 3,515 people with a wide range of
professions and expertise.

Details of the breakdown of staff numbers, recruitment, departures and other data are set out in section 6.11.1 of this
Universal Registration Document.

**6.6.1** **ATTRACTIVENESS AND CAREER MANAGEMENT**

**IMPROVING APPEAL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENT**

The challenge of appeal and career management was rated as a priority in the materiality analysis.

Attracting and developing the talent that the Group needs is one of the key factors that will lead the business forward. To
control these challenges, the Group relies on recruitment management, training and a remuneration policy that are all
adapted to its needs and on the promotion of diversity.

As a responsible employer, Getlink seeks to promote the personal development and fulfilment of its team members, which
it considers a key factor in its corporate strategy. Getlink believes that its success depends on the skills and loyalty of its
employees, as well as its ability to attract and retain highly qualified staff: employment and development of appeal are
essential elements for its development.


-----

The Group has implemented different measures to consolidate and continue its development. A Strategic Workforce
Planning (SWP) workstream was launched in 2020 covering five main areas:

forward planning - visibility of occupation and skills needs;

encouraging internal and external mobility;

the development of skills;

the integration of young people and keeping older people in employment; and

the career of staff representatives.

This very forward-looking approach is designed to prevent the risk of loss of key skills or a shortage of labour for certain
roles. The aim of the approach is to identify roles under stress and anticipate foreseeable departures up to 2030 by
implementing an Occupational Review. At the same time, the approach seeks to encourage attractiveness, mobility and
employability through training actions that facilitate the transition to new occupations. The Group is also working on the
implementation of digital tools that will make it possible to assess potential and organise succession plans.

Getlink created a recruitment website in 2019 in order to centralise Group recruitment on the internet. Covid-19 has strongly
limited recruitment in 2020, whether it be for fixed-term, permanent, work-study or apprenticeship contracts. Actions in
schools have also been slowed down due to the pandemic but are likely to be relaunched and continued in the coming
years. There are also plans to develop “Trade Ambassadors” who could encourage vocations by presenting the ambassadors’
knowhow in schools.

CIFFCO, the Côte d'Opale International Railway Training Centre, supports all these initiatives. As well as being a training body
recognised by rail operators nationwide, it also helps Eurotunnel's operational staff to implement the training plans internally.

**6.6.2** **MODERNISATION OF SOCIAL DIALOGUE (LABOUR RELATIONS)**

Labour relations are very important for the Group, particularly negotiations with staff representative bodies. The Group has
worked long-term to form sustainable and constructive labour relations so as to maintain a balance between the expectations
of its employees and the organisational constraints of the business.

Labour relations within the Group are based on trust and mutual respect in the dialogue between management and staff
representative bodies, which is a sign of the quality of the social climate. By way of reminder, national strikes against pension
reform in 2019 only slightly affected the Group (less than 0.01% of the workforce). Several majority agreements at subsidiary
and Group level have been signed, notably on gender equality, remote working and profit-sharing.

In France, ESGIE employees are represented by three union organisations and have a collective agreement as part of a
corporate agreement. Europorte subsidiary employees are also represented by three or four union organisations (three in
the case of Socorail and four in the case of Europorte France) and there are two national branch agreements.

In the United Kingdom, in view of a voluntary single union organisation agreement signed in 2000 by ESL with the Unite
union, all ESL employees (except management) are represented by Unite during collective negotiations. Employees are
entitled to join their preferred union for individual representation purposes.

CIFFCO, which was previously the only Getlink entity not to have a Social and Economic Committee (CSE) due to the number
of employees, established one in 2020.

Within the Getlink group, several dialogue bodies have been established with team members to ensure regular information
and an exchange of views on the Group’s social, economic and financial situation and its strategic direction.

The quality of labour relations, the fight against discrimination and the promotion of diversity as well as optimising
employees’ working conditions are factors that contribute to the success of the business. Getlink has made these matters
the objectives of the performance share plan that will be presented to a shareholder vote at the General Meeting to be held
on 28 April 2021.

During the period of the public health crisis, many initiatives have enabled the dialogue to be strengthened. The number of
CSE meetings have increased in order to keep staff representatives regularly updated; many consultations were conducted
with employee representatives prior to the introduction of short-time working in France and furlough in the United Kingdom
and specific working groups for the pandemic crisis situation were organised by the CSSCT (health, safety and working
conditions committees).


-----

Within the Group's subsidiaries, management and all employees were mobilised during the public health crisis to ensure
business continuity and customer satisfaction. For activities that could be managed remotely, home-working was facilitated
by relying on the performance of IT tools and networks. In a context of short-time working, compensatory measures for the
lowest salaries were taken at Eurotunnel, where 90% of net salary was set, subject to conditions, for employees with an
inactivity rate of more than 66%. In the interest of fairness, these salary goodwill gestures were not extended to senior
executives, executive officers and members of the Board of Directors who have waived part of their remuneration as indicated
in Cchapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document.

**6.6.3** **GENDER EQUALITY**

Getlink is very committed to respecting equality of treatment between men and women. Gender equality is
one of the important challenges in the materiality matrix.

Getlink’s commitment is reflected in the application of a fair policy in terms of recruitment, access to training,
remuneration and promotion for all team members both men and women throughout their careers. It is
present in the process of identifying high potential and appointing senior managers.

Several agreements in favour of workplace gender equality have been entered into within the Group subsidiaries, which
contribute to the approach to promote equality. Since 2018, Socorail and Europorte France have signed agreements relating
to professional equality between men and women with the aim of taking practical and effective steps in favour of women in
order to guarantee pay equality in comparable cases.

In 2019, ESGIE entered into discussions to negotiate a workplace equality collective agreement, which concluded in February
2020 with the renewal of a collective agreement. This action affirms Getlink’s desire to promote women and to put in
measures to raise awareness as an extension of the charter on professional equality project. ESL publishes an annual report
on equal pay for women and men. In 2021, ESGIE published the results of its workplace equality index, which at 86/100 was
above the 75 point threshold and is stable compared to the index published in 2020 in respect of 2019. In order to consolidate
this result, the organisation has developed an action plan with targets regarding female promotion (women to account for
at least 25% of total promotions over three years) and equal pay, ensuring that men and women with equivalent jobs,
experience and education receive the same pay.

A Group workplace equality charter was entered into in July 2020. Male and female team members were involved in its
development including attending a workshop in which specific actions to reduce gender inequality at work were proposed
and discussed.

**Targets**

The human resources departments of the various Group entities worked closely together to define the plan to deploy the
charter, which was proposed to the Board, who agreed on the following major three-year objectives:

Composition of the Executive Committee to be more than 40% women. The means associated with this objective are:
identification of female talent, a women’s network within the Group and development of specific training actions for
women managers.

Percentage of women in the top three tiers to be 25%. The means associated with this objective are: creating a dedicated
indicator, promoting at least eight women in the top three tiers at a like-for-like headcount and identifying female talent.

Percentage of women in management: 30%. The means associated with this objective are: promoting female employees
in traditionally male occupations, encouraging female candidates and specific training for women managers.

Percentage of female employees: 30%. The means associated with this objective are: proposing at least one female
candidate per recruitment process, unless this is completely impossible and conducting an annual survey on the pay gap
between women and men.

During recruitment, inclusion of a minimum of 40% of each gender.

The effective implementation of actions in favour of workplace gender equality within different Group subsidiaries will be
regularly and carefully monitored.

**6.6.4** **EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY**

**PROTECTING EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY BY LIMITING THE RISK OF ACCIDENTS**

As a responsible business, Getlink has made safety a core priority. Health and safety management schemes and compliance
with procedures are based around this essential value. In this area, as a responsible employer Getlink seeks to protect the
health, safety and well-being of its team members and to ensure a healthy and safe working environment for each of them
by strengthening the safety culture.

The materiality analysis identified employee health and safety as an important material challenge for the Group. It concerns
the risk of serious accidents that may cause bodily injury, occupational diseases and/or damage linked to handling hazardous
materials to team members. These risks are not included in the most significant specific risks for the Group.

The Group’s subsidiaries rely on health and safety policies to conduct their operations. They constitute the base supporting
applicable fundamental health and safety principles. The Europorte safety policy aims to improve the safety and working
conditions and to protecting the physical and mental health of team members by evaluating and preventing professional
risks and implementing all suitable personnel protection measures. Eurotunnel’s health and safety policy is based on
discipline, transparency and dialogue at all levels of the business. The health and safety of team members is paramount. Each
manager is responsible for applying health and safety principles at his or her own level. Moreover, everyone is responsible
for his or her behaviour regarding personal safety and works actively to reduce risks for everyone.

Various measures are in place to reduce the potential impact of these risks and to guarantee healthy and safe working
conditions for employees.

Getlink pursues its safety initiative through occupational training which includes safety topics, safety visits and/or inspections
which are regularly organised at sites by local management. Despite the public health context, the business has kept up a
very high number of safety visits (nearly 5,300 in 2020 compared with 6,000 in 2019) in the various subsidiaries. All safety
events are recorded and analysed to issue recommendations and produce action plans. In 2020, despite the Covid-19
pandemic, eight internal safety audits on compliance with procedures, operational processes, risk assessment procedures
and maintenance arrangements were carried out compared to six in 2019.

As part of an overall performance improvement approach, different safety indicators are continually and consistently
monitored. The Group’s subsidiaries also ensure that their procedures and safety and security rules are applied by their subcontractors.

Due diligence is required at all times to consolidate and support this progress in terms of reducing the number of accidents.
The Group is committed to a continuous improvement approach based on the definition of clear objectives and specific
actions to attain them and measure them through relevant indicators. Getlink is strongly committed to continuing this
progress through the following actions:

A “road safety” campaign conducted in 2020 by Europorte's top management at all Europorte sites.

A rerun in 2020 of the awareness raising campaign, entitled “Safety goes to the movies”. Based on short-format videos
broadcast on the corporate intranet, this campaign aims to achieve greater awareness of safety issues and to promote
and share best practices.

A Safety Forum was held in Folkestone in January 2020, bringing together 80 British and French employees from all
divisions. Its aim was to highlight the company's leadership and safety culture.

Training. The Group has decided to place the emphasis on a shared safety culture by organising dedicated training for
Group team members. Although the number of hours of training was lower in 2020 than in the previous year, due in
particular to the public health crisis, the number of hours devoted to safety remained at the same level as in 2019. In fact,
more than 16,300 hours of safety training were provided in 2020, representing 25% of the total number of training hours
(compared to 16% in 2019).

Innovation and technical progress. the existing use of connected equipment (such as telephones, tablets, computers, and
so on) have enabled the company to adapt very quickly to the context of the public health crisis, to deploy remote
working very widely and to set up the appropriate arrangements for lockdowns thus strengthening the resources
available to its team members to enable them to work safely.

An enhancement of the dialogue with teams working remotely in the context of the public health crisis through the
involvement and call to action of local line managers, which completed the prevention, listening and monitoring actions
implemented by the occupational health department.


-----

In 2009, Eurotunnel prepared a crisis plan in the event of a pandemic. It contains all the key elements of pandemic
management, including the impact on staff, alert protocols, implementation of governmental measures and contingency
planning for the four phases of a pandemic (containment, delay, mitigation and recovery).

The plan was activated and adapted to the situation from March 2020, setting up a steering committee and a working group
and thereby ensuring good decision-making, staff involvement and clear lines of communication.

The guidelines and measures recommended by the British and French governments have been taken into account and
implemented consistently. When government guidelines diverged on each side of the Channel, Eurotunnel, in line with its
usual practice, decided to implement the most demanding measures, clearly explaining the reasons to staff and
management.

Eurotunnel has also maintained close relations with the relevant safety authorities and has kept the CTSA (the Channel Tunnel
Safety Authority) regularly updated.

In the 2020 public health context, the Group's various subsidiaries have set up systems and undertaken various actions to
protect the health of employees, customers and the various stakeholders while preserving the Group's performance. Thus,
Covid-19 leads have been appointed within the Eurotunnel and Europorte subsidiaries. All safety personnel, whether
members of the safety divisions, safety facilitators or CSSCT representatives, participate actively in working groups. Weekly
meetings have been organised between representatives of the CSSCT and the representatives of the various departments to
monitor the measures put in place as part of changes in the health protocols.

In 2020, ElecLink strengthened its training relating to psycho-social risks in times of pandemic. Newcomers are trained in
this area. Support is offered to employees to help them in case of health problems. Communication on these subjects has
been enhanced during the period of the public health crisis.

Issues relating to the safety of employees and anyone working for Getlink remain and always have been the Group's top
priority. This topic is the subject of a specific working group in the WAYforward programme set out in section 1.1.4 of this
Universal Registration Document.

**Results and targets**

The Group's workplace accident frequency rate was 5.0 in 2020 compared with 3.1 in 2019.

In respect of the Eurotunnel segment, this change is essentially the result of the implementation of short-time working, which
has affected support staff (less exposed to the risk of accidents) more than operational staff. Thus, in the calculation of the
frequency rate, in 2020, the proportion of hours relatively more exposed to the risk of accident increased compared to the
total number of hours considered in previous years. Since this is a ratio, the frequency rate has mathematically been impacted
upwards. These low severity accidents occurred during walking or manual handling operations (without mechanical tools)
and were analysed and corrective action taken. In addition, no accidents occurred for ESL.

In respect of the Europorte segment, the upward trend in the frequency rate in 2020 is primarily the result of sustained
activity particularly during the recovery from the first lockdown. In addition, the particular attention and increased vigilance
regarding the risks of contamination of Covid-19 have sometimes made the implementation of the company's safety
fundamentals more complex, certain action plans had to be interrupted to respond to the health emergency and staff
absences linked to the public health crisis have resulted in more sustained activity within the teams.

The Group is maintaining its efforts in the area of safety and is constantly seeking to consolidate its performance. This result
for the year 2020 remains below the target set for 2020 (frequency rate of 5.7) as well as those for the years 2016 to 2018.

Furthermore, the relative severity of accidents that occurred resulted in a low Group severity rate in 2020 of 0.3. This rate has
remained stable compared to 2019.

The 2020 financial year shows an improvement in the results for subcontracted personnel compared with 2019. The number
of accidents was reduced from 16 in 2019 to 14 in 2020 for Eurotunnel, with a frequency rate of 7.7 in 2020, in line with the
objective of a frequency rate of 8 or less. No accidents were recorded for the Europorte subsidiaries' subcontracted personnel
between 2017 and 2020.

The ongoing mobilisation of local management, the strong commitment of the Executive Committee and the strengthening
of safety teams within the operating divisions remain the major priority and make safety a constant concern.

Training remains a key objective for management, who will revive and reinforce this subject with increased focus, particularly
in the area of safety as set out in section 6.6.5 below.

Lastly, the health measures put in place by Eurotunnel from the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic aimed at ensuring the
safety and protection of both customers and team members were the subject of an on-site verification audit by AFNOR (the
French standards authority) in February 2021. AFNOR officially certified Eurotunnel following verification of the Covid-19
health measures implemented with the maximum score of 100% (details of the certification are set out in section 6.5.3 of
this Universal Registration Document).

**6.6.5** **WELL-BEING AT WORK**

Getlink is deeply committed to maintaining a positive working environment which supports performance whilst limiting the
effects of a poor atmosphere or work-related stress. In France, a charter on the handling of work-related psychosocial risks
has been in force since 2009 for ESGIE employees. In 2015, ESGIE concluded a company agreement whereby rest days can
be given to parents of seriously ill children, which was extended to cover partners and co-workers who are seriously ill and
for whom the lack of family support leaves them in precarious isolation. In 2018, after a trial period, management and union
organisations signed a remote working agreement. The human resources department is considering extending it to the rest
of the Group, but is waiting for sufficient feedback on the roll-out of the ESGIE agreement. A remote working agreement is
in the course of being developed at Europorte. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the use of remote working, which has
become the preferred option for suitable positions. In this context, whilst working habits have been disrupted and have had
to change, the management of the Group's various entities have adapted by regularly calling on their teams and informing
them of the support systems that each of them may call on.

An agreement to prevent the effects of exposure to certain occupational risks was signed by management and Socorail in
2018. Committees dedicated to improving working conditions and mental health units are some of the actions put in place
by Group subsidiaries to tackle hardship at work. In the United Kingdom, an employee assistance programme is available
24/7 to provide support to team members who are dealing with personal and/or professional problems. Management listens
carefully in order to detect stressful situations. Committees made up of representatives of all ESL employees were set up in
2020 to target improvements in well-being and mental health.

The WAYforward project launched in 2020 which includes the Group's major strategic transformation workstreams
(presented in section 1.1.4 of the Universal Registration Document) fully integrates this aspect of the new working methods.

In France, the CSE, through the CSSCT, is tasked with ensuring the protection of the health and safety of employees and
putting controls in place that aim to improve their working conditions. Mostly made up of staff members, the CSE analyses
professional risks and verifies - including through surveys and inspections - that rules are being followed. It is also consulted
prior to any major modification to working conditions.

In the United Kingdom, the Occupational Health Service (OCHS) plays a key role in preventing occupational illnesses through
educational awareness actions, and through the control measures that are set up to improve working conditions. Composed
of representatives of employees and business managers, the committee aims to promote safety at work and improve working
conditions. OCHS conducts health promotion campaigns and a free vaccination programme for staff in winter. A working
group is preparing to set up a health monitoring programme that will follow staff members throughout their working lives.
In addition, Eurotunnel and the union Unite have put an agreement in place on difficult working conditions that came into
force on 1 January 2021.

ElecLink has set up a training module on stress management and stress awareness for all employees and has taken initiatives
to promote well-being in the workplace. Vulnerable workers have been supported by the OCHS throughout the pandemic.

In addition, ElecLink employees have been provided with complementary health benefits and 24/7 support through a
helpline, staffed by a team of nurses, counsellors, midwives and pharmacists is available to people who need help with a
specific health problem or with medication or treatment.

In conjunction with Eurotunnel's management, the CSSCT representatives have contributed to the implementation of a
specific and individualised listening system to help and support staff in the context of the prevention of psycho-social risks.
An on-call service provided by occupational psychologists, specialists in psycho-social risks, enables each person (whether
an employee, temporary worker or subcontractor) who so wishes to be supported and listened to on request.


-----

The Group has been flexible and responsive during the Covid-19 crisis, distributing masks and hydroalcoholic gel to all
employees, limiting travel and organising remote working, adapting posts to maintain activity, holding regular meetings of
the crisis unit and communicating regularly with all staff.

Lastly, Getlink continued its workplace harassment awareness campaign within the Group’s French subsidiaries. The human
resources teams, awareness officers, staff representatives and all managers have received training through an external
organisation. An awareness and training module to prevent any form of workplace harassment is also available to all the
Group’s French employees. Subject leads, chosen from among the employee representative bodies and management, have
been appointed within the Europorte subsidiaries.

An equivalent module was also made available to British employees in February 2020. All employees received awareness
training during 2020.

From a medical standpoint, employees have regular medical check-ups with occupational healthcare professionals and may
also request additional appointments.

The fall in training hours in 2020 is linked (i) to the public health crisis, which has resulted in the postponement or cancellation
of some training courses, with the exception of safety training, the proportion of which has increased as indicated in section
6.6.4 above and (ii) the slowdown in recruitment (147 in 2020 compared with 236 in 2019). Training remains a strong objective
for management, who will revive and reinforce this topic, with increased efforts, particularly in the area of safety.

Based on the observation that shared awareness of risks is an essential attribute and considering a more effective safety
culture to be one of the company's performance factors, general management decided to strengthen prevention and to set
a target for the minimum number of hours of safety training. The management decided to adapt its safety objectives;
however rather than focusing on a traditional reduction in the number of accidents, it decided to strengthen the average
training in order to encourage safe behaviour.

**Results and targets**

The absenteeism rate rose in 2020 compared to the previous year in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The change is
the result of an increase in the number of hours of absence due to illness, observed over the periods of March to April and
October to December, in connection with the public health crisis (such as employees with Covid-19 symptoms, contact cases
and quarantine).

The Group has set a target of 4.50% for the 2021 absenteeism rate.

**6.7** **ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION**

In a world with limited natural resources, companies cannot ensure their continuity without making constant efforts to
control their energy consumption and reduce the environmental impact of their operations. For Getlink, it is clear: it cannot
be successful in the long term without better control of its environmental impact.

As part of its structural commitment to “low-carbon” transport, the Group has pursued an ambitious approach that has
placed the fight against climate change at the centre of its environmental policy ever since it launched Tunnel operations. In
2020, Getlink worked to strengthen its strategy and extend its environmental ambitions to ensure that the service provided
to customers and the inclusion of new innovations make a tangible contribution to reducing its environmental impacts. By
delivering this strategic vision, the Group will be aligned with international objectives and will contribute to national climate
transition and environmental protection goals. This strategy aims to engage the teams in a demanding and meaningful
momentum serving the Group’s employees, customers and partners as well as the planet.

Given the material environmental challenges faced by the Group, the Group’s environmental policy comprises three pillars
that already contribute to the Group’s ambition to consolidate its position as a key player in eco-responsible transport.

Pillar 1: Energy transition and climate

Pillar 2: Preservation of natural environments (protecting natural areas)

Pillar 3: Waste management and the circular economy

After a presentation of the organisation of the Group’s environmental management system, the rest of this section 6.7 will
describe the initiatives carried out in 2020 grouped into each of the three pillars above.

**6.7.1** **STEERING AND ORGANISATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY**

At Board level, the Ethics and CSR Committee has primary responsibility for regularly reviewing the Group’s environmental
performance and strategic direction and for reporting the results of its analyses to the Board as mentioned in chapter 4 of
this Universal Registration Document.

In accordance with the Afep/Medef Code, the Board is committed to promoting long term value creation by the Group while
considering the social and environmental impacts of its operations.

In order to support the organisation to move towards a lower carbon economy, the Board of Directors of Getlink SE has
appointed an Environment and Climate Lead Director. The role of the Environment and Climate Lead Director is to ensure
that the Board of Directors is able to make informed decisions on a just transition and encourage a long-term
transformational approach to climate change issues.

On the Group's Executive Committee, all aspects of the environmental strategy are led by the administrative and financial
director, to whom the CSR department (expanded in 2020 with the recruitment of an environment director) was attached in
September 2020.

For governance purposes progress is monitored by the Eurotunnel and Europorte environment committees, which were set
up in 2020. These committees met four times this year and are chaired by the CEO. They bring together work site managers
and management committee members. In addition, across the Group the environment department organises environmental
team meetings to ensure, among other activities, alignment and sharing of best practices between the different entities.

The current policy and future objectives are in line with the approach undertaken by all the Group's subsidiaries over many
years to structure the environmental management initiatives and system. These approaches have often been recognised by
various awards and certifications as presented in section 6.1 of this Universal Registration Document. For example, in terms
of climate change, Eurotunnel was awarded Carbon Trust Standard certification in 2009 and this certification received its
biennial renewal in 2019. Getlink has also been ranked fifth in the Challenges/Statista “Les champions du climat”[26] 2020,
which acknowledges the Group’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions in recent years from among hundreds of companies across
all business sectors. Since 2019, in order to ensure comprehensive and proactive consideration of development and
environmental issues, Eurotunnel has also reorganised its management of environmental challenges by placing them in a
project department which has a transversal role across the departments of the Concession. All projects are classified
according to their environmental issues and an extended analysis of major projects is conducted encompassing the
Corporate Social Responsibility pillars.

Since 2014, Europorte’s subsidiaries have been awarded TK’Blue status by the European TK’Blue Agency; this label measures
eco-responsible commitment, and helps assess the technical, economic, environmental and social performance of the
transport offering. Europorte received the TK’Blue transport company prize at the 2019 Eco-Responsible Transport Awards.
This prize recognises Europorte’s commitment to sustainable transport that is more environmentally friendly and is at the
heart of the Group’s overall CSR approach. At Socorail, the Europorte subsidiary specialising in logistics management at
industrial sites, progress in environmental protection and safety was rewarded with the renewal of **ISO 9001 (quality**
management) and MASE (Company Safety Improvement Manual) certifications, notably for the Southern region in 2020 for
a four-year period. Socorail's Infrastructure Management branch has also been MASE certified since 2019 and has been
included in the ISO 9001 certification scope in early 2021. Europorte France renewed its Safety & Quality Assessment for
Sustainability (SQAS) certification for its headquarters and is currently renewing certification in the regions.

Following Ecovadis assessments conducted at the request of certain customers, Europorte France has kept its “gold” rating
in 2020 for its rail activities. The joint Europorte/Socorail analysis for the 2020 financial year is being finalised at the date of
this Universal Registration Document. This rating reflects the quality of the business's CSR management system at the time
of the assessment. The following table summarises the qualification status of each of the Group’s rail freight entities.

Lastly, a regulatory energy audit was conducted in 2020 in Europorte France and Socorail under the French Energy Code
(article L. 233-1) and the conclusions of this audit reinforce the Group’s policy.

In addition to these initiatives to structure and certify environmental management, the Group has been keen to get its teams
involved. The Europorte employee awareness initiative launched in 2018 covering eco-citizen initiatives (waste management,
eco-friendly actions and water management) continued throughout 2019 and 2020, via themed articles suggesting specific
sustainable development initiatives and distributed through a monthly in-house newsletter. This awareness initiative was
reinforced in 2020 by compulsory talks on the environmental impacts of local activities and on the management of accidental
spills.

The following sections deal with the three pillars of the environment policy, describing the initiatives carried out. At the start
of each pillar, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals are given.

**6.7.2** **PILLAR 1: ENERGY TRANSITION AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**

In general terms, energy transition and climate change are major challenges for economic players, which impact in their
activities in two ways:

via actions implemented to limit greenhouse gas emissions (implementation of policies and action plans); and

via new constraints resulting from the need to assess and integrate these new risks and adapt to climate change, whether
to anticipate the development of production systems and the economy towards a low-carbon economy, or to deal with
the physical impacts of climate change.

From the outset, Getlink has been committed to low-carbon transport. The rail sector accounts for less than 1% of national
emissions (both in France and the United Kingdom) and is a major lever for achieving national and European climate targets.
The future European classifications will clarify this position; based on the initial drafts of the delegated acts circulated by the
Commission, a large part of the Group’s activities should be regarded as environmentally sustainable.


-----

In 2020, the Group updated an assessment of its carbon performance against alternative means of mobility (ferries, aircraft,
road transport); this reinforces the Group’s comparative advantage in climate impact. In particular, an assessment conducted
in 2020 by an independent expert firm values the CO2 emissions avoided by the Group’s transport businesses at more than
2 million tonnes; this evaluation of the Group’s carbon footprint according to the Net Zero[27] framework is presented
hereafter. This situation boosts the Group’s market positioning and encourages the development of new opportunities to
capitalise on this unique advantage.

This is why the Group wishes to continue working on its emissions. Energy transition and combating climate change were
identified as an important material challenge for the Group during the materiality analysis. The Group is working in particular
towards replacing high-emission gases with low-emission gases for crucial uses (fire suppression and ventilation) and
traditional fuels with less polluting fuels for rail freight activities. In this regard, the Group is constrained by operational
requirements that it must take into account. Thus, energy consumption depends on the level of Eurotunnel's traffic, the need
to provide lighting at the terminals for safety and security reasons and the level of electrification of the lines on the national
rail network for the Group’s rail freight activities.

The Group’s emissions in 2020 compared to 2019 are presented in the following sections. Drivers for reduction both in terms
of actions already taken and the target for 2023 are set out.

**The situation in 2020**

In 2020, the Group’s internal greenhouse gas emissions fell by more than 21% compared to the previous year. This decline
is mainly due to the factors detailed in this section of the Universal Registration Document.

In summary, the Group's greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) using a market-based[28] approach are as follows:

**Change**

The breakdown of Group emissions by energy source for the past three years is presented below. While 2020 remains
atypical, the Group has strengthened its downward trajectory in emissions and is building on these past results to propose
an even more ambitious reduction target.

28 In this document, the distinction defined in the GHG Protocol between the market-based method for reporting electricity emissions,

based on contractual supply choices, and the location-based method, based on the physical supply of consumption sites connected to
a national electricity distribution network with a given carbon intensity, is used for the reporting of electricity emissions.

In view of the reduction in Eurotunnel’s activity in 2020, the **2020: contributions to the Group's GHG emissions**
proportion of electricity decreased significantly (from 36% to
27%). Moreover, NRD/ fuel oil/ petrol/ diesel remains the

Given the reduction in activity due to the public health crisis, it is difficult to compare 2019 and 2020. The main differences
between 2019 and 2020 can be explained as follows:

 Electricity - Eurotunnel et Europorte: the reduction in activity due to the health context led to a decrease in overall
consumption (Eurotunnel: -13%) and increased consumption on the British side to the detriment of the French side
under the project to strengthen the traction cable in the Tunnel which resulted in a further reduction of 170 tonnes of
CO2 equivalent, due to the low-carbon electricity supply in the United Kingdom.

 Halon: the decrease in the contribution of the extinguishing agent Halon 1301 (approximately -10% in tonnage) is due
to a reduction in leaks through a strengthened maintenance policy and the benefits of the removal of halon from
infrastructures and locomotives, which were fully realised in 2020.

 Refrigerant fluids: the main change concerns the R407C fluid. The amount emitted into the atmosphere increased by
approximately 1.4 tonnes compared to 2019 for two reasons. Firstly, considerable work was conducted on the
Passenger Shuttle heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems during the period (+50%) as part of the
chassis replacement project. In addition, a condenser fault was identified in 2019 and corrected with the supplier in
January 2020. In both cases, the increase was exceptional (the chassis replacement project will be completed by Autumn
2021). In the medium term, the mid-life Passenger Shuttle renovation programme[30] has been designed to eliminate
the remaining 13 tonnes of this fluid and so the potential for emission leaks.

 NRD/petrol/diesel: this heading consists mainly of emissions by Europorte diesel locomotives and includes emissions
by light vehicle fleets; the decline reflects the reduction in activity due to the public health context.

 Emission factor trends: 2020 provided an opportunity to update the majority of emission factors based on the most
recent values in recognised databases (including the fifth IPCC report). Almost all these values come from the ADEME[31]
carbon base, which ensures quantification consistency and traceability of trends year-on-year. In particular, this resulted
in downward adjustments to non-road diesel and fluid coefficients (halon, R22, R407C) and upward adjustments (e.g.
SF6).

 It should lastly be noted that following an independent review of its greenhouse gas footprint, the Group decided to
strengthen its reporting by including recent land use changes carried out as part of Brexit arrangements (approximately
16 hectares of natural land in 2019). The change in land use translates into a contribution of 232 tonnes of CO2
equivalent per year if amortised over 20 years.

The impact of national energy policies has been identified as one of the most significant specific risks for the Group and is
set out in section 3.1.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

Robustness of the Group’s emissions assessment

Eurotunnel is the first cross-Channel operator to have created and published a carbon footprint assessment since 2007, in
both France and the United Kingdom, using the method developed by ADEME. In 2020, Getlink tasked an independent
expert firm to further improve its carbon footprint methodology. This study supported previous assessments and
recommended a number of best practices that have been incorporated in the presentation of the figures in this chapter.

Electricity-related emissions (Scope 2) presented above have been calculated, in line with recent years, using the emission
factor indicated by the electricity provider (“market-based” methodology). To ensure full transparency, the Group also wished
to present its carbon footprint using the “location-based” method, i.e. by valuing each kWh consumed using the country’s
average emission factor. In France, the factor applied is the ADEME carbon base (Electricity – 2020 - medium consumption
mix). For the kWh consumed in the United Kingdom, the 2020 factor provided by the UK Department for Business, Energy
and Industrial Strategy (DBIS) is used[32]. Using this approach, emissions total 63,037 tonnes CO2 equivalent in 2020. The
difference between the two approaches lies mainly in the valuation of British electricity (48 GWh in 2020) which is considered
to produce zero emissions in the market-based approach as mentioned above.

Green Bonds

Aware of the need to help accelerate environmental transition, in September 2018, Getlink launched the issue of Green
Bonds for a principal amount of €550 million, increased to €700 million in October 2020. The net proceeds of this issue after
the redemption of the Green Bonds issued in 2018 were used to finance investments related to the ElecLink project, as well
as other eligible environmental projects. The redemption of the Green Bonds issued in 2018 is described in note G.1.1 of the
consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document. The projects covered fall into
three categories and, in addition to the refinancing of the 2023 Green Bonds, cover expenditure of €403 million at the end
of December 2020:

The most advanced projects have enabled the removal of four tonnes of the refrigerant fluid R22 (a fluid regulated since

16 tonnes of Halon-1301 (a fluid representing an emission potential equivalent to nearly 100,000 tonnes of CO2).

Inclusion of climate risks and opportunities

Beyond these emission-reduction targets, Getlink is fully aware of the need to analyse risks generated by climate change
and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Getlink is one of the organisations best prepared for the +2°C target for limiting
global warming according to the NEC[33] barometer[34] published in January 2020, a transparent, international and open
measure of the degree of exposure of large listed companies to ecological transition. Getlink is rated +100%, which is the
score for activities having the most positive impact on a scale where -100% is the score for organisations having the most
negative impact and 0 is the global industry average.

As the manager of an infrastructure of major importance to the British economy and at the request of the British Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and in line with the Climate Change Act 2008, Eurotunnel carried out a
study in 2011 of the infrastructure’s ability to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change. The Group wished to
launch an update of the physical risk analysis last November, starting with flood risk, through a partnership with Environment
Masters students at Littoral Côte d’Opale University. In addition, the modification of customer vehicles being one of the

strong trends in the transition to a low-carbon economy that has the most immediate impact for Eurotunnel activities, a
programme was launched in 2020 to structure the approach to speed up the acceptance of new engines types in the Tunnel
(electric, CNG, LNG, hydrogen).

In terms of the opportunities arising from climate transition scenarios, the Group is working to create new rail lines to
contribute to the European-wide modal shift promoted by the Green Deal in particular; the Amsterdam-London link became
fully direct on 26 October 2020.

More broadly, Getlink has decided to strengthen this study of climate change and transition risks and opportunities by
adopting a more extensive assessment of these risks and their impacts for the Group’s business in accordance with the Task
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) Framework, created at the time of the COP21. A partner was selected
in 2020 following a tender process; however, under the cost control programme to deal with the public health crisis this
study and its breakdown according to the 11 criteria recommended by the TCFD will now be carried out in 2021.

Lastly, in September 2020, the Group set an internal carbon price for certain investment projects to enable informed decisions
encompassing the carbon impact of projects and the various proposed solutions into decision-making. With the slowdown
in activity and projects in 2020, the full impact of this tool will be felt from 2021/2022.

**Extension of the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint to include Scope 3 emissions**

In 2020, the Group conducted its first extended emissions assessment of Eurotunnel and Europorte activities, including
Scope 3 emissions. This involved significant assessment work that is more complex than for direct emissions (Scopes 1 and 2).
While this data must be further refined (in particular, procurement items were valued based on carbon intensity per amount
invested), no significant scope was excluded. As this exercise, conducted in conjunction with an independent expert firm,
was completed over several quarters, 2019 data was used to establish these indirect emissions. The Group nonetheless
wished to share these initial results, which are representative of a typical year.

The Group’s indirect carbon footprint (Scope 3 including customer and visitor travel – Item 16 of ISO TR 14069 or the Bilan
Carbone®) totalled nearly 3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019. The vast majority of these emissions (93%) come from
customer travel around the Tunnel (emissions from passenger vehicles and freight before arriving at the Eurotunnel terminal
and upon arrival in the destination country). The remaining indirect emissions (123,000 tonnes), shown as "Other" in the
graph below, are mainly attributable to purchases and capitalised assets (74% of non-customer travel emissions) and energyrelated emissions not included in Scope 2. Home/work travel also counts for approximately 4% of non-customer travel
emissions.

Scope 3 initiatives and commitments to stakeholders (customers, suppliers)

Much of the indirect emissions induced by the Group's businesses depend on the level of decarbonisation of individual
vehicles and European freight over which Getlink has no direct levers. Nevertheless, Eurotunnel has undertaken several
projects aimed at positively influencing its entire value chain.

Firstly, the work programme in progress aims to welcome new types of engine in the Tunnel that are expected to be
increasingly prevalent among freight and passenger customers, especially those that are currently prohibited (CNG, LNG,
hydrogen).

Since 2015, the Group has provided a universal and free of charge recharging facility at the Eurotunnel sites in Coquelles
(Pas-de-Calais) and Folkestone (Kent) for customers with electric cars. The number of 100% electric vehicles using Passenger
Shuttles increased from 40 in 2014 to more than 6,700 in 2019 and close to 8,300 in 2020.


-----

Secondly, the Group is considering the introduction of different incentives to promote low emission transport means.

In addition, the Group is committed as a leader in eco-responsible transport to contributing its expertise and leadership to
benefit its subsidiaries and customers and help them reduce the carbon footprint of their activities. An eco-comparison tool
is available on the Eurotunnel website, which allows Truck and Passenger customers to calculate the average CO2 emissions
saved by using Shuttles. Similarly, Europorte, in conjunction with the European TK’Blue Agency, proposes an eco-comparison
tool that calculates and provides customers with the amount of CO2 emissions saved by using the Europorte fleet for a given
traffic compared to road transport.


Le Shuttle also promotes smooth, low-carbon travel by offering a service to cross the Channel with a bicycle.

In order to encourage the smooth mobility of employees and as part of business travel plans, 1.5 kilometres of bike paths
have been built and new electric charging stations will be deployed in addition to existing facilities for personal vehicles in
the coming months.

Lastly, the measures taken to digitalise the border in the context of Brexit also contribute by helping the fluidity of traffic
and controlling customers' emissions on Eurotunnel terminals.


Contribution to neutrality: a vision of Group emissions in the Net Zero Framework

Lastly, in a desire for greater transparency and fully aware of its role in the energy transition of mobility solutions, Getlink
wished to visualise its impact on greenhouse gas emissions in the spirit of the Net Zero Framework[35] emphasising in
particular that its businesses enable over 2 million tonnes of CO2 to be avoided each year.

This framework, initiated by Carbon 4 and promoted by a dozen companies, aims to clarify the contributions of each player
to carbon neutrality. The Group decided to present its 2019 data, which remains more representative of its activities. At this
point therefore, the emissions avoided by ElecLink have not been included in Pillar B, even though the interconnector project
with the United Kingdom is designed to facilitate the decarbonisation of power consumption on both sides of the English
Channel.

**Targets**

In line with the challenge of this pillar in the Group’s environmental policy, **Getlink undertakes to reduce its direct**
**emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 in tonnes of CO2 equivalent) by 15% by the end of 2023 compared to its 2019 emissions**
(like-for-like, which means that the figures take account of active companies). This is a new milestone in the trajectory that
the Group is taking to clarify its climate ambitions. Since 2020 was not sufficiently representative of activity levels, the Group
has chosen 2019 as the reference year for its direct emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 as defined by the GHG Protocol).

Compared with the Group’s previous target of 5% over 5 years, this new target represents more than a three-fold increase
in ambition.

The Group has identified three emission types to help steer its trajectory and the structuring of action plans (emission values
indicated are for 2019). Reduction levers and actions have been implemented for each emission type to maintain the carbonreduction trajectory to 2023 and beyond. A non-exhaustive list of the levers is set out below. Getlink operates in a highly
regulated rail environment. It should be noted that the implementation of some of the works will be subject to validation by
the IGC.

-----

**Type 1 – Europorte energy (21,947 tonnes of CO2 equivalent): emissions associated with diesel locomotives and**
shunting engines, electricity used for traction and workshops and heating of the Arc-lès-Gray workshop. In 2020,
Europorte launched a partnership with a major player in the biofuels sector to test the use of biofuels (residues of French
100% rapeseed oil) in its locomotives. Overall, this lever could eventually result in a gain of up to 20,000 tonnes Scope 1
emissions.

**Type 2 – Eurotunnel energy (21,149 tonnes of CO2 equivalent): electricity consumption for traction and auxiliaries in**
the France and United Kingdom scopes and gas heating (passenger building in the United Kingdom). The levers for
reducing the impact of electricity consumption on Eurotunnel’s activities are two-fold: energy efficiency and low-carbon
electricity purchases. As for the first one, the load factor is a key driver to optimise consumption relating to Shuttle
traction but other energy efficiency measures focusing on consumption generated by processes, heating and lighting at
both terminals will continue to be implemented (more than €800,000 costs are engaged to change to LED lighting in the
workshops). In addition, energy gains associated with the use of new Truck Shuttles (eligible for the Energy Saving
Certificate Programme) and fan optimisation measures at the Tunnel cooling plant are well established and will continue
to contribute to frugal consumption levels. As for the second lever, a certified zero-carbon contract in the United Kingdom
on 1 January 2018 (the “Blue for Business” 100% nuclear power supply contract) has led to zero direct emissions from
electricity consumed in the United Kingdom. In order to increase the share of low-carbon electricity and to contribute to
national renewables targets, the Group will launch a study to analyse and prioritise the various possible initiatives:
renewable energy capabilities on a self-consumption or power purchase agreement basis, guaranteed source purchases
and so on. The study will be conducted in 2021 to ensure the implementation of the recommended tools before the end
of the current supply contracts (31 December 2022).

**Type 3 – operational emissions (14,771 tonnes of CO2 equivalent): emissions related to halon, refrigerant and SF6**
isolating gas leaks as well as emissions related to the Eurotunnel and Europorte light vehicle fleet and Eurotunnel
industrial vehicles (works trains, works locomotives and buses).

   - Leaks from refrigerants used in the Tunnel and Shuttle cooling circuits and from the halon used as an extinguishing
agent by Eurotunnel have a significant impact on the Group's carbon footprint given the heating power of these
fluids[36]. The Group has been engaged for almost 10 years in their reduction and substitution.

   - The halon replacement programme is now complete in the Tunnel’s plant rooms and at the French and British
terminals (approximately 16 tonnes of halon eliminated). The programme involving 57 locomotives ended in 2019.
The removal of halon still present in the Passenger Shuttles will remove 58.3 tonnes of halon. The project will be part
of the Passenger Shuttle modernisation programme, known as the Mid-Life Programme, encompassing the
replacement of the main systems: fire detection and suppression, air conditioning and ventilation, fire door, network
and cabling[37]. Until then, the Group, which received confirmation from the European Union in 2020 of the extension
of Eurotunnel’s authority to use halon, has proposed a new protocol for monitoring possible halon leaks to prevent
them to the greatest extent possible, by establishing more demanding criteria than European and national legislation
require.

   - Similarly, the replacement of refrigerant gases with lower emission solutions was launched several years ago. In
particular, the R22 used in the Tunnel cooling system was replaced in 2018 with an HFO fluid. The last of the R22 will
be removed from locomotives in 2021. R407C fluid present in Shuttles and responsible for 4,439 tonnes of emissions
in 2019 will be substituted by a fluid producing threefold lower emissions under the mid-life programme referred to
above.

   - The Eurotunnel and Europorte fleet of light vehicles is responsible for around 2,000 tonnes: these comprise company
cars as well as the cars and buses used to transport employees on the terminals and for operation and maintenance
activities. Hybrid and electric vehicles currently represent 9% of the Eurotunnel/Europorte light vehicle fleet (64
vehicles). A programme to optimise driving laws and greener vehicles, taking into account operational constraints
(availability, positioning of vehicles in isolated areas for Europorte in particular), will contribute to the reduction
trajectory.

   - Lastly, Eurotunnel industrial vehicles (works trains and locomotives, maintenance modules, vehicles specifically
designed to transport people in the service tunnel and forklift trucks) mainly use diesel and contribute 2,100 tonnes
of CO2 to Group emissions. Equipment renewal programmes have either already been launched or are planned to
reduce significantly emissions in the next few years.

36
For example, 1 kg of halon is equivalent to more than 6 tonnes of CO2, while 1 kg of R407C is equivalent to 1.6 tonnes of CO2.

**6.7.3** **PILLAR 2: PRESERVATION OF NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS (PROTECTING NATURAL AREAS)**

**Biodiversity**

In the area of biodiversity, Getlink works within the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Convention on Biological
Diversity. One of its primary aims is to protect biodiversity and the sustainable use of its components.

With significant land reserves in France and the United Kingdom, since construction of the Tunnel, the Concessionaires have
established natural areas over several dozens of hectares dedicated to protecting and developing biodiversity. In France,
natural spaces are located around the Concession perimeter and therefore are not open to the public. The “ornamental
gardens” located at the edge of the Coquelles terminal, with seven hectares of lakes, are a rest area highly appreciated by
migratory species, and an essential nesting spot for many birds.

In the United Kingdom, the Samphire Hoe site is a specific example of the Group’s intention to support biodiversity and
protect the environment. A nature reserve covering around thirty hectares at the base of the white cliffs of Dover, Samphire
Hoe was created by reusing five million cubic metres of chalk and marl extracted from the Channel when drilling the Tunnel.
This strip of land was gradually transformed into a nature reserve. The everyday management of this protected space is
entrusted to the White Cliffs Countryside Partnership (WCCP), which receives the support of various volunteers from the
county of Kent. The partnership between the Concessionaires and the WCCP received its 15th Green Flag Award in 2020,
recognising the excellent environmental quality of this nature reserve.

Samphire Hoe (https://www.samphirehoe.com/) welcomes over 100,000 visitors each year (120 000 people were able to take
advantage of the site during the lockdown periods in 2020). Since 2014, a visitor centre - co-funded by Eurotunnel and the
Heritage Lottery Fund - has provided school groups with access to a fully-equipped all-season learning space. Still in
partnership with the WCCP, the Concessionaires are also committed to maintaining and protecting the Doll’s House Hill site,
the steep hillside rising above the Folkestone terminal facilities - where the flora and fauna are part of a Site of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSI). Moreover, the soil and vegetation in a wooded area in Biggins Wood were taken from the Folkestone
terminal location and re-established nearby to protect the essence of this British primary forest.

In France, polluting machinery used to maintain the green spaces around the Coquelles terminal has been partially replaced
with cattle. On this extensive pasture, around fifteen Salers and Highland cattle, breeds chosen for their hardiness and ability
to live outdoors all year round, even on the Opal Coast, graze 34 hectares in a gentler manner than human activity using
mechanised tools. An agreement was signed with a farmer in the region who takes care of the two herds.

In addition, in recent years, the Group has put in place alternative solutions to reduce the use of phytosanitary products.
These products perform many tasks: maintenance of green and mineral spaces, maintenance of safety equipment (such as
areas with fences, concertinas and infra-red barriers) and railway areas in working condition. In a normal year, the Concession
uses about 1,200 litres to carry out these tasks across its entire perimeter (650 hectares in France and 150 hectares in the
United Kingdom). However, as weed-clearing activities could not be carried out on the rail area in 2020 and, thanks to
mechanical and manual weeding techniques, the Group reduced its use of products in green spaces at the Coquelles terminal
by 70%, bringing 2020 consumption down to 550 litres. For its part, Europorte was awarded the Ecophyto 2018 label by the
French ministry of agriculture. 10 of the 12 sites where Europorte manages weed control have already banned glyphosate.
As part of its environmental trajectory, the Group wishes to continue experiments and the substitution of phytosanitary
products by natural or organic products to the extent permitted by safety and security constraints.

To monitor its ecological issues, Eurotunnel has renewed since 2008 a partnership with the Conservatoire des Espaces
Naturels (CEN – a French organisation to conserve natural spaces) and the Groupe Ornithologique et Naturaliste (GON – a
French ornithology and naturalist group) which issue recommendations for a better consideration of natural spaces for which
the business is responsible.

**Water and soil vigilance**

In addition to protecting natural areas and biodiversity, the Group is also keenly focused on protecting other resources such
as water and soil. Pursuant to French law no. 923 of 3 January 1992 on water, the Concessionaire France Manche must submit
for administrative approval all installation or structural projects involving Installations Classified for the Protection of the
Environment (ICPE). It must also submit for approval any work or activities performed outside the ICPE scope which are likely
to cause a hazard to health and public safety, prevent water from flowing freely, reduce water resources, notably increase
flood risk or seriously harm the quality or diversity of aquatic life.


-----

Money has been spent since construction of the Tunnel to prevent the consequences of business activity on the environment.
The infrastructure notably includes separate rainwater and wastewater collection networks, retention basins and treatment
plants. The infrastructure recently developed for Brexit is also part of this approach, with specific studies conducted to ensure
the effectiveness of the Concession’s overall drainage system is maintained at an optimal level (collection of 50-year rainfall
and water-tight effluent-catching structure to avoid pollution of the natural environment). In addition, Eurotunnel must lower
the groundwater at the entrance to the Tunnel to avoid flooding and ensure the stability of railway tracks, given the high
groundwater. Regular fire drills use this water, which avoids the consumption of approximately 30,000 m[3] of drinking water
from the public network.

In addition, soil pollution risk due to fuel leaks from trucks during shuttle-entry shocks has been identified by Eurotunnel for
several years. Following a causal study, Eurotunnel implemented a rigorous process to prevent and mitigate the risk of
pollution. New Shuttle loading operating methods were deployed to increase vigilance of the truck drivers in question
(discontinuous platforms and anti-intrusion barrier). Since 2017, this initiative has enabled the number of leaks of more than
50 litres to be reduced fourfold. Since the beginning of 2020, only seven significant fuel leaks have been identified and
reported to the IGC. In addition, specific procedures have been implemented since 2007 to structure the response to these
leaks by using systems such as absorbent booms, clogging products and pumping and transfer of captured effluents to the
waste park, in order to ensure these leaks on the terminals do not impact on the environment.

**Air quality**

Getlink is committed to controlling air quality and the impact of emissions from its activities, an issue covered by three of
the Group’s material challenges. It has been a concern for Eurotunnel since the beginning of the Concession. The
Concession’s diesel locomotives, which pull work trains, have been fitted with catalytic converters since 2007. The Tunnel is
cleaned regularly using water, a rail industry good practice, and a project to enhance active cleaning was launched in 2019
with CETIM (including fine characterisation of dust and particulates present in the Tunnel). In addition, operating procedures
(Shuttle purge system, provision of preventive equipment during critical activities) and constructive arrangements (such as
over ventilated premises and concentration of sensitive activities in a limited number of workshops.) promote the control of
air quality.

Since 2004, Eurotunnel has tasked independent and varied bodies to conduct over 20 studies to measure professional
exposure in all environments (Passenger Shuttle staff, works in the Tunnel, workshop staff), the most recent of which was
conducted in March 2020. These studies all confirmed compliance with exposure limits for gases (CO, NO, NO2, SO2, diesel
fumes), dust, volatile organic compounds and ultrafine particles. Where appropriate, protective equipment was considered
relevant and the proposed improvements were communicated. These controls will be established in the long-term and based
as much as possible on "self-assessment” measures; air quality will continue to be integrated into the assessment of the new
projects concerned. Finally, the ongoing replacement of work trains, modules and shunting engines with lower emission
motor vehicles will contribute significantly to improving air quality during work in the Tunnel while also reducing the impact
on the climate. It is also important to emphasise the extent of preventive medical monitoring for employees, which has been
in place for several years. This includes lung flow tests and chest scans offered to those most exposed to certain respiratory
risks.

In Europorte’s operations, the main air quality issue concerns mobile sources (shunting engines and locomotives) which have
a pervasive impact on their area of presence. The locomotives used were designed based on the highest standards in force
at the time of their construction (EU97/68 stage IIIA and UIC II according to UIC624). The proposed decarbonisation will
further improve their impact on air quality. To complement Europorte’s overview of air quality at its facilities, a measurement
study will be conducted at the Arc-lès-Gray maintenance site by 2022.

Furthermore, given the age of the infrastructure managed by the Group, the risk of asbestos is limited. Nevertheless, the
structural components containing asbestos have been listed and their state of repair is monitored in the three-yearly asbestos
technical dossier (no non-compliance was identified in the most recent report dated June 2019).

Lastly, the Group has identified ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in its facilities and equipment. The substitution of certain
components used in Eurotunnel infrastructure cooling systems (notably R22 fluid) is currently being finalised, such that only
a single source will remain from 2021: halon, used as an extinguishing agent. However, halon itself is being substituted under
the Passenger Shuttle mid-life programme (total substitution by 2027). The Group is therefore on a proven trajectory to
removing all sources that are harmful to the ozone layer.

**Noise vigilance**

Although noise has not been identified as a material challenge by the Group's stakeholders, Getlink remains vigilant
regarding noise emissions related to its activities. Within the confines of the Concession, the maximum noise emission
thresholds are established under the prefectoral authorisation for repair, maintenance, handling and rolling stock testing
activities. In addition, during the recent replacements of electrical converters at the Sangatte site, baffles were put in place
to reduce the acoustic impact. If, however, noise disturbances are found at the edge of the Concession site, Eurotunnel
undertakes to carry out the appropriate analyses. For its part, Europorte has undertaken the replacement of cast-iron brake
blocks with composite brake blocks that significantly reduce the acoustic footprint of freight trains.

All these measures reflect the Group’s commitment to promote actions to protect biodiversity and natural environments and
to involve its stakeholders.

Lastly, the Group has made no provision for environment risks.

**6.7.4** **PILLAR 3: WASTE MANAGEMENT AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY**

The Group applies a waste collection and processing strategy which prioritises recovery or reuse. Most waste products come
from industrial activities and vary in type and quantity from year to year depending on the projects being undertaken.

The hazardous waste classification is based on the European Waste Code (EWC), which is described in the related
methodological guide:

Non-hazardous industrial waste (NHIW): waste generated by businesses which could potentially be processed in the
same facilities as household waste: cardboard, glass, kitchen waste, packaging, textile waste, office waste, septic tanks,
and so on. Inert waste (non-contaminated mineral waste) is included in non-hazardous waste.

Hazardous industrial waste (HIW): waste which can cause harm to humans or the environment, as defined by decree no.
2002-540 dated 18 April 2002 and its application circular dated 3 October 2002.

**Ensuring responsible waste management**

The materiality analysis positioned the challenge of waste management as limited, although this topic has been adopted by
the Group from the outset and it is not a significant risk for the Group since it is being managed. However, mindful of the
importance of this issue, the Group applies a waste collection and processing strategy which prioritises recycling, recovery
or reuse and keeps abreast of the emergence of new industries or innovations in these fields.

The production of non-hazardous industrial waste for the Group increased slightly by 3% compared to 2019. The production
of hazardous waste also increased by 18% year-on-year to 659 tonnes. This increase is partly due to some unusual
maintenance projects that also reduced the rate of unrecycled waste. In addition, late returns of packing slips issued in 2019
were received only in 2020, resulting in 2020 tonnage values being close to corrected values for 2019.

The French part of Eurotunnel non-hazardous industrial waste is sorted to be recovered. Around 30% of this recovered waste
is recycled into Solid Recovered Fuel (briquettes) for industrial boilers. This process was made possible by the emergence of
new Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) channels. ESGIE mainly uses local companies to recover waste:

 for the recovery of hazardous and non-hazardous waste (common waste is recovered as SRF);

 for the recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE);

 for the recovery of cooking oil;

 for the recovery of metal;

 recovery of wooden pallets: internal recycling for reuse.

In 2019, Eurotunnel implemented a plastic cup recycling plan at the office buildings of the French part of the Concession;
stock stood at 15m[3] in 2020 and material recovery is conducted by a partner.

At Europorte, almost all the waste produced comes from the maintenance of rolling stock and rail infrastructure. At industrial
sites, waste management procedures are generally the responsibility of the customer. Europorte applies its own waste
management procedures to its port rail infrastructure services and Europorte’s locomotive maintenance workshop at Arclès-Gray. Waste is sorted internally for both these activities. A dynamic waste recovery campaign was launched at
headquarters with the implementation of six selective sorting categories. This approach has been shared with the regions
and has been (partially) duplicated at some sites. The management of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020 did not allow Europorte to
introduce the new planned sorting bins (cardboard, glass, light bulbs / electrical equipment); it nevertheless was possible to
increase dematerialisation of everyday operational documents (such as numerous authorisations).

Results

✓
In 2020, the Group waste recovery rate for the whole of France was 91%[38] . The Group is currently working to establish a
benchmark in the United Kingdom to enable the recovery, recycling and reuse rates to be compared using a robust
methodology in terms of traceability and compatibility with the regulatory requirements applicable on both sides of the
Channel.

**Circular economy**

In partnership with local water management institutions in the Calais area, Eurotunnel works on its contribution to water
management beyond the Concession land. The collection of water after significant rainfall should help limit flooding in Calais.
This closed-circuit method prioritises soil infiltration rather than discharging large amounts of water into the sea.

This year, in view of the long-term use of protective masks, Eurotunnel introduced the supply of reusable masks for all staff
and customers as well as for many subcontractors, and also considered two options for recycling surgical masks (alternative
fuel or material recycling after treatment). One of these options will be implemented in the first half of 2021. Similarly, at the
beginning of the crisis, Europorte teamed up with Saint-James (a Normandy textile manufacturing craft company) during
the approval phase of these fabric masks to provide washable masks to employees and thus avoid the equivalent of 300,000
disposable masks.

In addition, Eurotunnel has undertaken two complementary projects. It launched the collection of cigarette butts
(approximately 300 kg per year) for recovery (the partnerships analysed this year should come to fruition in 2021), and is
planning to collect used uniforms to recycle them into insulating material for the construction industry and car interiors
(which will start from the renewal of the clothing services contract in the first quarter of 2021).

Again this year, the Group’s information systems department continued its partnership with Energie Jeunes to give a second
life to laptops and help equip 600 middle school pupils in the Hauts de France and Ile de France regions.

Lastly, given the sharp decline in passenger numbers in 2020, Eurotunnel redistributed a portion of unsold food resources
at the terminals as donations to the Secours Populaire charity.

**6.8** **COMMUNITY AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT**
**CREATING A GREATER LOCAL IMPACT**

Corporate social responsibility is deeply ingrained in the Group’s history and culture. The Group seeks to establish close ties
with all the communities that it interacts with – customers, local public authorities, economic partners – in France, in Great
Britain and in Europe.

Although not identified as significant specific risks, the development of local employment and the economy are among the
important material challenges identified during the materiality analysis.

**6.8.1** **DIALOGUE WITH STATES, LOCAL (PUBLIC) AUTHORITIES AND REGULATORS**

Dialogue with the States, local public authorities and regulators was identified as a priority material
challenge for the Group. Through its role as a developer, Eurotunnel is deeply committed to establishing a
foothold in the Hauts-de-France region. After being the birthplace of the first industrial revolution in France
(coal and the steam-powered engine) as well as withstanding the second, it is now diving into the third
industrial revolution, with the combined momentum of energy transition and digital transformation. This
industrial revolution, known as REV3 in Hauts-de-France, is a dynamic momentum by companies, public
authorities and regions, schools, universities and citizens to be pioneers in social and environmental progress, and to reap
the rewards in terms of value creation, competition, jobs and well-being.

With regard to the dialogue with the States, Getlink maintains regular relations with the States who granted the Concession.
For more than two years, Getlink has been working with governments and European authorities on high-level relations, as
part of the overall pre-emptive approach of the different options, raising the awareness of public authorities to the specific
requirements of cross-Channel transport and its economic reality and identifying practical potential constraints. As indicated
in section 1.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document, Eurotunnel's teams have been preparing for Brexit in order to offer
the best possible service to customers and to ensure smooth passage and efficient border controls as part of the reestablishment of customs formalities in force since 1 January 2021. Thus, the various safety, security and migration checks
and the capture of data on truck loads have been brought together at a single point. Eurotunnel has launched a new service,
Eurotunnel Border Pass. In addition, a new SIVEP Customs centre has been built near the Coquelles terminal to carry out the
new customs, veterinary and phytosanitary controls.

Since 2019, Eurotunnel has initiated discussions with the French authorities with a view to reopening duty-free shops at the
French terminal in the context of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. For its part, the United Kingdom
confirmed this possibility at the British terminal in 2020. In the second half of 2020, contact with the French authorities
intensified, including contact with several government ministries, the IGC and the European Commission. These exchanges
made it possible to recall that the principle of these duty-free shops had been provided for as early as 1986 in the Treaty of
Canterbury and in the four-party Concession Agreement and that these shops were present on the Fixed Link terminals until
1999, when duty-free sales were banned in European Union Member States.

**6.8.2** **TERRITORIAL ANCHORAGE (LOCAL IMPACT)**

As a committed partner in its economic and social environment, Getlink has always been a leading economic player and
local employer. The Group also benefits from a solid foothold in the Calais area and Kent, two regions that it helps to
promote, Eurotunnel having helped to boost employment with the creation estimated some time ago of more than 8,000
direct and indirect jobs[39] since the Tunnel came into operation.

For over 25 years, the Tunnel has been a vital link between Great Britain and continental Europe.

Every day, Getlink works to promote local economic and social development. In 2020, 68% of the Group’s recruitments were
local (96% for Eurotunnel), enabling Getlink to continue to strengthen its local foothold and work to promote local
employment.

Getlink has traditionally been strongly involved in the local areas where it operates by developing numerous local
partnerships, although in 2020, this contribution was slowed down by the Covid-19 crisis.

Pursuant to the regeneration agreement signed in 2006 with the French State, Eurotunnel continues to contribute financially
and through its expertise to Calais Promotion, the development agency for the Calais area. This contribution is earmarked
primarily for supporting job creation. It also provides financial support and actively participates in the cross-border job fair,
Jobs Frontaliers, a local initiative that facilitates the professional mobility of young people between France, the United
Kingdom and Belgium.

Through its commitment to Fondation Agir Contre l’Exclusion (FACE), which provides assistance to those most in need, the
Group encourages its team members to get involved in and initiate humanitarian and charity projects. Several part time work
contracts have been signed since 2013 between the subsidiary ESGIE and people assisted by FACE Calais.

Getlink is a member of MEDEF and Calais Promotion, the economic development agency for the Calais area.

Europorte is a member of Norlink, the association of the ports of the Hauts-de-France, of the supervisory board of the port
of Dunkirk and of GERIF – the French umbrella group for regional river businesses.

Other sub-contracting and service partnerships were signed between ESGIE and local companies to develop employment
and guarantee a community foothold for the Group’s activities.

By investing in the international energy transport infrastructure, which is vital to regulate consumption at continent level,
Getlink contributes to this movement: in 2020, Getlink invested more than €74 million in the ElecLink project, which brings
the total investment since 2016 to €679 million as at 31 December 2020.

Eurotunnel’s land reserves at Coquelles (Pas-de-Calais) were gradually transformed into a 700-hectare Zone d’Aménagement
Concertée (ZAC or mixed development zone), that now includes a shopping centre drawing 6 million visitors a year on
average (in a normal, non-public health crisis year).

Europorte is developing its rail freight haulage activities, which enable disused marshalling yards and railway lines, as well as
lines with restricted traffic, to continue operating or to be brought back into service.

Together with the French State, the Hauts-de-France region, the Côte d’Opale Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the
urban community of Dunkirk and SNCF Réseau, Getlink is financing feasibility studies on the modernisation of the FréthunCalais-Dunkirk railway line, which would involve its electrification and an increase in rail freight path availability.

A key player in the natural, economic and human environment, Eurotunnel fulfils its social responsibility through concrete
commitments and actions to support the community:

Payment since 2010 of 10% of the land rental income from the wind farm on its Coquelles site to Secours Populaire,
which distributes the payments in the form of “energy vouchers” to families in Pas-de-Calais. Following its expiry in 2019,
the partnership agreement between Eurotunnel and Secours Populaire was renewed for two more years (2021).

Support for project leaders and start-ups in the Calais area through the Maison du Numérique et de l’Innovation (Digital
and Innovation Centre), which is chaired by Getlink’s Chairman, Jacques Gounon. Opened in 2019, this new structure is
entirely dedicated to new technologies and aims to help a broader audience discover digital technology and recent
developments. Comprising various rooms for training and an open space for co-working, it also has several 3D printers.

In October 2020, Getlink's IT department and the Maison du Numérique et de l'Innovation (digital and innovation centre)
in the Calais area collaborated to offer two workshops to introduce girls aged 11 to 13 to computer programming and
the creation of video games. As part of the same partnership, Eurotunnel also worked with Greta (the French national
continuing education organisation) to organise Digital Days (27 January to 7 February 2020) on the theme of "customer
relations via digital technology". The aim was to enable people in insecure situations (jobseekers, disabled employees,
residents of high-priority disadvantaged areas and so on) to access digital technology, particularly through discovery
workshops. To provide a practical illustration of the use of digital technology in companies, a morning session was held
at Eurotunnel's premises on 31 January 2020, during which around fifty people with no experience of this attended a
presentation of mobile applications used within the company, the skills required, the current and future development of
the company in terms of digital.

Commitment to high-priority disadvantaged areas by signing a three-year partnership agreement in July 2019 between
Eurotunnel, the Grand Calais Terres et Mers urban area and the State, represented by the Prefect of the Pas-de-Calais.

The ESGIE Social and Economic Committee regularly backs good causes actively supported by colleagues.

Since 2013, Getlink turns to the Association des Paralysés de France (APF) for any service within the areas of expertise of its
partner companies, which employ people with disabilities. The Group also entrusts projects to APF workshops near Calais,
notably specialising in mechanical welding, carpentry and packaging.

Despite the current circumstances, the Group has maintained its relationships with universities and schools with the aim of
fostering a better understanding of its business and encouraging young people into the world of work:

partnership between Europorte and the French Ecole Polytechnique on the predictive maintenance of engines; and

participation since 2016 in the “Professeurs en entreprises” operation initiated by the Fondation C Génial, a foundation
for scientific and technical culture. This operation is aimed at secondary school teachers (and other members of the
national education system). In addition to encouraging the professional integration of young people, it promotes the
sectors and the scientific and technical professions of the companies visited. Several Eurotunnel rolling stock managers
took part in this activity.

Getlink also offers its expertise in managing transport infrastructures and rail activities to various public bodies at European,
national and regional levels. The Group is:

A founding member of the Fer de France association which was created in 2012 to bring together the leading players in
the French railway industry. The objective of the organisation is to implement actions to enhance and promote the sector.
It also offers a platform for discussions between the players to discuss subjects such as the impact of the Covid-19
pandemic. Fer de France lobbies the government on behalf of the sector and supports the European Railway Agency.

Getlink is a member of the UTP - Union des Transports Publics et Ferroviaires (only Europorte in 2020) and participates
in the following three committees: railway social affairs, railway system, legislation and European affairs.

In September 2020, Getlink joined forces with the RATP to create a partnership, "Régionéo", to respond to calls for tender
for regional passenger rail transport as part of the opening up of the rail market to competition in France.

In 2020, as part of the recovery plan, the 4F coalition was created, "4F Fret Ferroviaire Français Futur". It is an alliance
bringing all the players in the railway sector together, including the French Railways Association (AFRA) and Europorte.
The aim of this coalition is to promote rail transport and to establish cooperation between companies in the sector. In
the United Kingdom, Getlink participates in the RFG - Rail Freight Group, the British equivalent of AFRA. This organisation
exchanges on the consequences of Brexit and rail deployment projects.

Objectif OFP (Opérateurs Ferroviaires de Proximité), of which Europorte is also a member, aims to facilitate and support
the implementation of OFPs in ports and regions on a sustainable economic basis.

An active member of I-Trans, the global competitiveness organisation and the reference organisation for railways in
France. The Group’s human resources director participates as the coordinator in the CAPFOR (training project
management and coordination circle) operational group that aims to make existing training more consistent with the
industry’s expectations, creating a pool of expertise in the region and developing high quality higher education with
international influence.

As a partner of the École des Ponts et Chaussées, in 2018 Getlink renewed the “Rail transport sciences” fellowship for five
years. This partnership aims to make progress in rail science by studying the whole scope of the activity, as well as the
sustainability of facilities and technologies in place.

**6.9** **METHODOLOGY**

Getlink’s CSR reporting approach is based on the transparency principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and aims
to meet regulatory obligations relating to the Non-Financial Performance Statement (Déclaration de Performance ExtraFinancière - DPEF) set out in articles R. 225-105, R. 225-105-1 and L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code.

The Group’s CSR data is consolidated under the responsibility of the Group’s CSR department.

**Consolidation period for CSR reporting**

The period set for the annual reporting of CSR information is the calendar year (from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020).

The period set for the annual reporting of environmental information is a rolling year (from 1 October 2019 to 30 September
2020), due to the lack of availability of the data and auditable evidence in a timescale that is compatible with the publication
of the Universal Registration Document.

**Scope of consolidation**

Data is consolidated for all Group entities, with the exception of ElecLink and Getlink SE for environmental data. ElecLink was
not included in environmental data since it is not operating; it is currently at project stage. The construction work was not
subject to an impact analysis, and therefore its inclusion in the Universal Registration Document did not appear necessary.
The construction work relates to the installation of 51 km of DC cable in the existing North rail tunnel, the construction of
two converter stations and the burying of AC cables through to the networks of the French operator RTE and the British
operator NGET.

The French Environmental Code states that the need to conduct an impact analysis is assessed with regard to the project’s
main features, notably its nature, location, scale and elements likely to be significantly affected by the project (article R. 1223). After examining the project’s main features, the sensitivity of the area likely to be affected and the foreseeable impacts
of this project, as well as its probable combined effects, the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
confirmed by letter dated 1 August 2014 that none of the three ElecLink and RTE projects required an impact analysis.

**Choice of indicators**

The purpose of the indicators is to monitor the commitments made by the Group and its progress in terms of environmental
and workforce performance. The indicators were chosen by the Group because they are appropriate to its activities and serve
the needs of stakeholders as well as its regulatory obligations.

Workforce indicators have been chosen to:

measure the results of the human resources policy and the Group’s social commitments; and

take account of cultural differences and local disparities (different national law, varying legal obligations etc).

Environmental indicators have been chosen to:

serve environmental policy and reflect progress in the Group’s different activities; the chosen indicators are appropriate
to the Group’s activities; and

allow monitoring of the Group’s performance on key environmental challenges.

The following indicators have been excluded since they are not applicable to the Group’s scope of activities: the campaign
against food waste, the campaign against food insecurity, the respect for animal well-being and responsible, fair and
sustainable nutrition.

**Internal control and consolidation**

Workforce information is collected from each entity through a computerised data feedback system, which includes
consistency checks. The data is checked and validated by the Group’s entities and consolidated across the entire scope by
the Group’s CSR department.

Each entity’s environmental information is collected through the computerised data feedback system. The data is checked
and validated by the Group’s entities and consolidated across the entire scope by the Group’s CSR department.

During consolidation of workforce and environmental data, consistency checks are carried out at Group level. The results are
compared with previous years. Significant differences are thoroughly analysed and processed.

Corporate social information is collected, checked and validated at the level of each entity. It is then centralised by the Group
human resources department.


-----

**Further information and methodological limits of the indicators collected**

The methodologies used for some workforce and environmental indicators may in practice be limited by:

a lack of standardisation in national/international definitions and legislation;

the representativeness of the measurements taken or limited availability of external data needed to calculate the
indicator;

the qualitative and therefore subjective nature of some data; and

the practical methods used to collect and input this data.

The information relating to Installations Classified for the Protection of the Environment (ICPE) are presented in consolidated
form in the environmental information published by the Group.

Consumption of natural gas

Consumption at Europorte’s subsidiary sites not equipped with accessible meters has been extrapolated on the basis of a
ratio of natural gas consumption/m²/day. This ratio was calculated based on data from sites equipped with usable meters.

Consumption of electricity

Electricity consumption at Europorte’s subsidiary sites not equipped with accessible meters has been extrapolated on the
basis of a ratio of electricity consumption/m²/day. This ratio was calculated based on data from sites equipped with usable
meters.

For motor engines, the consumption of electricity has been estimated using kilometres travelled by engines, according to a
methodology agreed by all the parties involved (Europorte, the French Rail Network/Network Rail and the energy supplier).

Greenhouse gas emissions

The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions is based on a methodology compatible with the ADEME methodological guide
and was reviewed by an independent firm in 2020. Most of the emission factors (reviewed during the update carried out in
2020) are taken from the ADEME carbon base. The other emission factors were taken from DEFRA (UK electricity mix) and
from the product safety data sheets for the RS70 refrigerant. At the time of that update, the impact of the recent change of
use of land on the French perimeter of the Eurotunnel Concession following extensions required by Brexit, resulted in a
contribution of 4,640 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Following ADEME's recommendations, this surplus emission is amortised
over 20 years and therefore results in an annual contribution of 232 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year.

Greenhouse gas emissions linked to electricity consumption are calculated based on the Location and Market Based methods
(in accordance with the CDP and GHG Protocol) as described below:

“location based” method: approach which reflects the country’s average electricity emissions and uses an average
emission factor specific to the country’s energy mix; and

“market based” method: approach which reflects emissions from sources of electricity chosen by the organisation with
certain specific contracts in mind, such as renewable electricity purchases, via green certificates.

Lastly, it is made clear that Scope 2 emissions (related to electricity) include emissions related to the share of the electricity
consumed by rail operators using the Tunnel's infrastructures (unaccompanied freight, Eurostar etc) to ensure consistency
with the non-financial reporting of previous years.

The calculation of indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3) was established in 2020 using an independent firm. Since the
aim of this first exercise was to give an order of magnitude, the 2019 full year data was used.

Calculation of greenhouse gas emissions avoided

The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions avoided was established in 2020 using an independent firm. The calculation
was based on 2019 operating data as well as carbon performance calculations updated in 2020 (2019 data). The emission
factors are taken from the ADEME carbon base (road, rail and electricity transport in France), the ICAO/DGAC (air transport),
DEFRA (British electricity) and the carbon assessment carried out by the same firm (Europorte rail freight, ferry). The reference
scenarios corresponding to alternative mobility in the absence of the fixed cross-Channel link are as follows:

Europorte activity (90 kt): all tonne-kilometres transported by Europorte are carried by truck;

Eurotunnel Truck Shuttle (165 kt): 100% ferry use;

Eurotunnel Passenger Shuttle (410 kt): 100% ferry use;

Eurotunnel's rail freight customers (50 kt): on British soil (approximately 50% of the journey), goods are transported
entirely by road; on European soil, 50% are transported by road and 50% by rail links in France, Germany and the
Netherlands; and

Eurotunnel passenger rail customers (Eurostar) (1,370 kt): the shift is considered to be 100% to air, considering that the
traffic created by the Tunnel would have been created by low-cost airlines and that other shifts (to other tourist
destinations) were negligible.


-----

Waste products

Data relating to waste generated by operations at customers’ sites, collected for the monitoring of the activities of
contractors, is excluded from the scope of reporting. Accordingly, only waste recovered on behalf of Europorte and its
subsidiaries and listed on a waste tracking form is included in reporting.

Consumption of water

The consumption of water for the Europorte subsidiary sites not equipped with meters has been extrapolated by applying a
ratio of consumption of water in cubic metres per employee present on site per day. This ratio was calculated based on data
from sites equipped with usable meters.

Rate of absenteeism

In the calculation of the rate of absenteeism for the four French Europorte entities, the number of scheduled hours is obtained
by multiplying the number of fulltime equivalent staff by the number of theoretical hours.

Training

The training budget is the sum of logistics costs (when available), external costs and the related staff costs.

Average training hours are obtained by dividing the total number of training hours by the total workforce present on
31 December of a given year.

Rate of non-permanent employment

Trainees and students with work-study contracts are excluded when calculating this indicator.

**External audit**

An external check has been undertaken in respect of conformity of the Declaration with the stipulations of article R. 225-105
of the French Commercial Code and the fairness of the information supplied pursuant to sub-paragraph 3 of I and II of article
R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code communicated in this report in accordance with article R. 225-105-2 of the French
Commercial Code. In 2020, the audit was led by Mazars. The 2020 assurance report expresses reasonable assurance for three
environmental indicators, 12 workforce indicators and one societal indicator (information marked √) and limited assurance
for all other information presented in the Non-Financial Performance Statement of this Universal Registration Document.

**6.10** **GRI STANDARDS CROSS-REFERENCE TABLE**

The Global Reporting Initiative, or GRI, was created in 1977 by the association of CERES (Coalition for Environmentally
Responsible Economies) and UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) to establish a set of indicators to measure the
level of progress of corporate sustainable development programmes. To this end, it proposes a series of standards to report
on different levels of performance in economic, social and environmental terms.

Since the GRI standards are an international reference for reporting on environmental, social and economic performance
and impacts, and in the interest of transparency and comparability of published data, the Group has chosen to use the
principles to help the Group implement the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (2011) and the “Ten Principles” of
the United Nations Global Compact (2000), as well as to help define the content and quality of the information provided.
The Group has chosen to present a cross-reference table in order to establish equivalences when these are complete and
relevant. This table will make it easier for the reader to identify the information sought while ensuring the link between the
Group's reporting systems and the GRI standards.

**6.12** **REPORT BY THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY**

**REPORT BY THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY ON THE NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT INCLUDED IN**
**THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT**

This is a free translation into English of the independent third party’s report issued in French and is provided solely for
the convenience of English-speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance
with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.

For the year ended 31 December 2020

To the General Meeting,

In our capacity as independent third party, accredited by COFRAC number 3-1058 (scope available at www.cofrac.fr), and
member of the Mazars network of one of the company’s Statutory Auditors, we hereby report to you on the non-financial
statement for the year ended 31 December (hereinafter the “Statement”), included in the Group management report
pursuant to the requirements of articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code
de commerce).

**The entity’s responsibility**

The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the Statement, including a presentation of the business model, a
description of the principal non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the
outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators.

The Statement has been prepared in accordance with the entity’s procedures (hereinafter the “Guidelines”), the main
elements of which are presented in the Statement and available on request from the entity’s head office.

**Independence and quality control**

Our independence is defined by the requirements of article L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code
of Ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the ethical
requirements and French professional guidance.

**Responsibility of the statutory auditor appointed independent third party**

On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:

the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;

the fairness of the information provided in accordance with article R. 225 105 I, 3° and II of the French Commercial Code,
i.e., the outcomes, including key performance indicators, and the measures implemented considering the principal risks
(hereinafter the “Information”).

It is also our responsibility to express, at the request of the entity and outside the scope of accreditation, a conclusion of
reasonable assurance on the fact that the information selected by the entity[41] has been established, in all its material aspects,
in accordance with the Standards.

However, it is not our responsibility to comment on the entity’s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory
requirements, in particular the French duty of care law and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation nor on the
compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.

**Nature and scope of our work**

The work described below was performed in accordance with the provisions of articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French
Commercial Code, as well as with the professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (“CNCC”) applicable
to such engagements, and with ISAE 3000[42]:

we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities’ activities and the description of the principal risks
associated;

we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability,
neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;

we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in article L. 225102-1 III as well as information set out in the second paragraph of article L. 22-10-36 regarding compliance with human
rights and anti-bribery and tax avoidance legislation;

we verified that the Statement provides the information required under article R. 225-105 II of the French Commercial
Code, where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence
of the information required under article L. 225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;

we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of principal risks associated with the all the
consolidated entities’ activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business
relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key
performance indicators associated to the principal risks;

41 See Appendix.
42 ISA 3000 - Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information.


-----

we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:

   - assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including
the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and;

   - corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important
presented in Appendix; concerning certain risks (Cyber-Attacks, Regulatory Context and compliance, Climate
Transition), our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the others risks, our work was carried out on the
consolidating entity and on a selection of entities[43];

we verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with
article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the Statement;

we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and
assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information;

for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important
presented in Appendix, we implemented:

   - analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in
those data;

   - tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures
and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing
entities[44] and covers between 99.5% and 100% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators
and outcomes selected for these tests;

We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.

We believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited
assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.

**Means and resources**

Our work was carried out by a team of 6 people between October 2020 and February 2021 and took a total of 14 weeks.

In order to assist us in carrying out our works, we called on our specialists in sustainable development responsibility. We
conducted a dozen interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Declaration, notably representing the General
Secretariat, the Administration and Finance Department, the Legal Department, the Human Resources Department and the
Environment Department.

**Conclusion**

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated nonfinancial statement is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information,
taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.

**Reasonable Assurance Report on Selected CSR Information**

Concerning the information selected by the company and identified by the sign √ in Appendix, at the request of the company
on a voluntary basis, we performed work of the same nature as that described in the paragraph "Nature and scope of the
work" above for the key performance indicators and for the other quantitative results that we considered the most important
but in greater depth, in particular with regard to the number of tests.

The selected sample thus represents 99.5% of the headcount and 100% of the environmental information identified by the
sign √.

We believe that this work enables us to express reasonable assurance on the information selected by the company and
identified by the sign √.

**Conclusion**

In our opinion, the information selected by the company and identified by the sign √ has been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.

The share capital may be increased or reduced by a collective decision of the shareholders in accordance with applicable
laws and Getlink SE’s Articles of Association.

As at the date of this Universal Registration Document, Getlink SE is not aware of any charge over any significant proportion
of its share capital.

**7.1.2** **FORM AND TRANSFER OF ORDINARY SHARES (ARTICLES 9 AND 10 OF THE GETLINK SE ARTICLES OF**

**ASSOCIATION)**

Unless otherwise provided by law or regulations, ordinary shares are held in registered or bearer form as the shareholder
chooses.

The ordinary shares are freely tradeable. They must be held in a securities account and are transferred by inter-account
transfer under the conditions set forth by applicable laws and regulations.

**7.1.3** **OTHER SECURITIES**

As at the date of this Universal Registration Document, apart from the 2025 Green Bonds referred to below, Getlink SE has
issued no securities that do not represent share capital nor any securities redeemable in shares or securities with warrants
attached. On 30 October 2020, Getlink SE issued €700 million Senior Secured Notes in the form of the 2025 Green Bonds,
which are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange (trading as Euronext Dublin) and are admitted to trading on
the Global Exchange Market. The Green Bonds were issued at par and carry interest at an annual rate of 3.5%, payable half
yearly on 30 June and 30 December. They align with the principles of Green Bonds published by the International Capital
Markets Association in 2018 (rating BB- by S&P and BB+ by Fitch). The Green Bonds are described in section 8.2.5 of this
Universal Registration Document.

**7.1.4** **AUTHORISED BUT UNISSUED SHARE CAPITAL, COMMITMENTS TO SHARE CAPITAL INCREASES**

There were 550,000,000 ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2020.

The table below summarises the authorisations granted to the Board by the Getlink SE Combined General Meeting, held
when first convened on 18 April 2019, in order to increase the share capital. The delegations have not been used. A proposal
will be made at the 2021 Combined General Meeting that they be renewed as per the table below.

The number of financial authorisations has gradually reduced since 2007. Apart for the authorisations required by law for
employees, only two authorisations are now presented for a vote: share capital increases with preferential subscription rights
and share capital increases with contribution in kind.

**Free shares – collective plans**

Since 2011, by authority of the General Meeting, the Board of Directors has proceeded to grant a free allocation of ordinary
shares to each of the Group’s employees (except for senior management and executive officers of Getlink SE who have
renounced their allocation) as follows: 200 ordinary shares (2011), 310 ordinary shares (2012), 100 ordinary shares (2014),
150 ordinary shares (2015), 75 ordinary shares (2016), 75 ordinary shares (2017), 100 ordinary shares (2018) and 125 ordinary
shares (2019) per employee respectively.

Further to the approval of the shareholders’ General Meeting held on 30 April 2020 of a collective free share plan of existing
ordinary shares, the Board that day granted 448,875 free ordinary shares to all employees of Getlink SE and of companies or
entities related to it on the basis of 125 ordinary shares per employee. The definitive acquisition of these ordinary shares is


-----

conditional on staff remaining as employees of the Group and the shares continuing to be held for a minimum period of
four years.

**Preference shares**

Getlink SE issued preference shares convertible into ordinary shares subject to performance conditions to the Group’s senior
management staff in accordance with the authorisation given by the General Meeting on 18 April 2018 (D preference shares)
and by the General Meeting on 18 April 2019 (E preference shares), convertible into ordinary shares subject to certain
performance conditions.

The Extraordinary General Meeting of 18 April 2018 authorised the creation by the Board of Directors of the D preference
shares, convertible into ordinary shares at a maximum conversion ratio of 1,000 ordinary shares. The one-year vesting period
for French tax residents expired on 18 April 2019 and the issue of 1,127 D preference shares was materially completed. These
shares are described in section 8.3.2 of this Universal Registration Document.

The Extraordinary General Meeting of 18 April 2019 authorised the creation by the Board of Directors of the E preference
shares, convertible into ordinary shares at a maximum conversion ratio of 1,000 ordinary shares. The one-year vesting period
for French tax residents expired on 18 April 2020 and the issue of 1,142 E preference shares was materially completed. These
shares are described in section 8.3.2 of this Universal Registration Document.

**Free ordinary shares subject to performance conditions**

The General Meeting of 27 April 2017 authorised the grant of a total of 1,200,000 ordinary shares to members of the Group’s
senior staff subject to the following performance conditions:

the average performance including dividends (TSR) of the Getlink SE ordinary share over a period of three years compared
to the performance of the Dow Jones Infrastructure Index (40%);

the economic performance of the business, assessed by reference to the average EBITDA rate of achievement over a
period of two years covering 2018 and 2019 (50%); and

the performance of the CSR composite index (10%).

At the end of the three-year vesting period, the Board of Directors stated that the overall weighting linked to the achievement
of the performance conditions amounted to 65%. The number of ordinary shares granted in 2020 under the 2017 Plan
amounted to 775,776 (net of shares cancelled, if any, in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan), based on a
conversion ratio of 65%.

The General Meeting of 30 April 2020 authorised the allocation of 265,000 free ordinary shares of the company, subject to
performance conditions, to employees and/or executive officers of the Group, on one or more occasions.

The external performance condition, i.e. the TSR, is based on the performance - including dividends - of the Getlink SE
ordinary share compared to the performance of the GPR Getlink Index, over a three-year period. The share of the TSR
weighting will represent 40% of the cumulative weighting.

The first internal performance condition is based on the company's economic performance, assessed by reference to the
average rate of achievement of the EBITDA target announced to the market (at constant exchange rates and on a like-forlike basis), over a three-year period (2020/2021/2022). The share of the EBITDA weighting will represent 50% of the
cumulative weighting.

The second internal performance condition is based on the CSR composite index. The share of the CSR weighting will
represent 10% of the cumulative weighting. The CSR weighting will be equal to 0 for a CSR performance strictly below the
CSR composite index.

The exact number of ordinary shares that will vest at the end of the vesting period will depend on the degree of achievement
of the performance, it being borne in mind in particular that:

if the rate of achievement of each criterion is less than 100%, there will be no right to ordinary shares;

if the rate of achievement of one of the criteria is equal to or greater than 100%, the grant will follow a progressive scale
depending on the degree of achievement of the objectives;

the ratio of the award in ordinary shares will reach 39% of its potential if each criterion is equal to its intermediate level
(corresponding to a weighted average achievement rate of 105.75%); and

the grant ratio will reach 100% of its potential if each criterion exceeds its upper tier. In any case, if the weighted average
attainment rate is below 112%, the award ratio will not reach 100% of its potential.

**Potential volume of all ordinary share plans**

As at 31 December 2020, the total number of stock options granted but not yet exercised (after deduction, if applicable, of
stock options cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was 196,455 (31 December 2019: 337,155)
representing approximately 0.04% of the share capital of Getlink SE as at 31 December 2020.


-----

As at 31 December 2020, the total number of free ordinary shares granted to employees still with the Group was
434,750 ordinary shares (31 December 2019: 430,000), representing 0.08% of the share capital as at 31 December 2020.

As at 31 December 2020, the total number of D preference shares allotted but not yet irrevocably vested (after deduction, if
applicable, of shares cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was 1,443 (31 December 2019: 1,500),
representing 1,443,110 ordinary shares, or approximately 0.26% of the share capital of Getlink SE as at 31 December 2020.

As at 31 December 2020, the total number of E preference shares allotted but not yet irrevocably vested (after deduction, if
applicable, of shares cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was 1,351 (31 December 2019: 1,465),
representing 1,351,123 ordinary shares, or approximately 0.25% of the share capital of Getlink SE as at 31 December 2020.

As at 31 December 2020, the total number of free ordinary shares with performance conditions, granted but not yet
irrevocably vested (after deduction, if applicable, of shares cancelled in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan) was
260,000 (31 December 2019: 1,193,500), or 0.05% of the share capital as at 31 December 2020.

The potential volume of all share plans existing above corresponds to 0.67% of Getlink SE’s share capital.

The average annual burn rate of the company over the past three fiscal years corresponds to 0.27%.

**Year** **2020** **2019** **2018**

Annual rate 0.13% 0.35% 0.34%

On 31 December 2020, the Group’s employees held 4,740,850 ordinary shares, which represented 0.86% of the share capital
and of which 2,696,358 ordinary shares (approximately 0.49% of the total share capital) were held in the Group savings plan
in France and 411,469 ordinary shares in the Share Incentive Plan in the United Kingdom. In addition, under the free shares
scheme French and British employees held 1,547,085 ordinary shares and 2,269 preference shares in French registered form
and, through a trustee, 85,938 ordinary shares in British registered form.

The number of free shares which have been granted or waived during the financial year is detailed in note E.5 to the
consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

**7.1.5** **SHARE CAPITAL HISTORY OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS**

Over the course of the last three financial years, the share capital of Getlink SE has stayed at 550,000,000 fully paid up
ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.40 each. As indicated in section 7.1.4 of this Universal Registration Document,
Getlink SE has authorised the issue of preference shares convertible into ordinary shares.

**7.2** **DIVIDEND POLICY**

Getlink SE’s net result for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to a loss of €36,398,184. The Combined General
Meeting on 28 April 2021 will be asked to approve the company’s statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2020
showing this loss, as well as the transactions reflected in those financial statements, including non-deductible charges
(€55,324.18) corresponding to the surplus of the depreciation of the rent on tourist vehicles (article 39-4 of the French
General Tax Code).

Confident in its long-term prospects, the Group confirms its commitment to shareholder return and, on 25 February 2021,
announced that it intends to propose the distribution of a dividend of €0.05 per share for the 2020 financial year to the
Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2021.

A dividend distribution of €27,500,000 for the 550,000,000 ordinary shares comprising the share capital and with dividend
rights less shares held by the company on the date of distribution will therefore be proposed at the General Meeting. It will
be proposed that the loss for the 2020 financial year be allocated to the balance of accumulated retained earnings from
previous financial years and to deduct €27,500,000 from distributable profits:

Loss for the financial year (€36,398,184)

Profits carried forward €354,963,882

Legal reserve €22,422,885

Dividends €27,500,000

Balance carried forward €291,065,697

If, on the date of the distribution of the dividend, the company holds some of its own shares, the amount not paid because
of these treasury ordinary shares will be allocated to the balance carried forward.


-----

Getlink SE has made the following dividend distributions over the course of the last three years:

**Financial year** **2019** **2018** **2017**

Dividend per ordinary share – €0.36 €0.30

Theoretical number of ordinary shares involved 550,000,000 550,000,000 550,000,000

Theoretical value of amount allocated to distribution – €198,000,000 €165,000,000

Actual number of ordinary shares involved* – 536,151,198 534,617,424

Actual value of amount allocated to distribution* – €193,014,431 €160,385,227

- After adjustment resulting from treasury shares.

The dividend policy is determined by the Board; it takes into account the Group’s investment needs, the economic context
and all other factors deemed relevant.

The Group’s priority is to ensure a regular increase in the remuneration of its shareholders, while preserving sufficient
self-financing capacity to enable investment as required and to ensure the Group’s development. As a result, the Group
intends to pursue its policy of steady dividend growth for its shareholders.

This objective is by no means a commitment by the Group; future dividends will depend, in particular, on the Group’s results
and financial position.

**7.3** **SHARE BUYBACK**

The General Meeting of shareholders held on 30 April 2020 authorised Getlink SE to purchase, or procure the purchase of
its own ordinary shares, under the conditions set by articles L. 225-209 et seq. of the French Commercial Code.

**7.3.1** **DESCRIPTION OF THE 2020 SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME**

The characteristics of the share buyback programme were agreed by the Board on 30 April 2020 and published pursuant to
article 241-2 of the AMF General Regulations. Pursuant to the 2020 buyback programme, Getlink SE is authorised, for a
period of 18 months to purchase, or to procure the purchase of, its own ordinary shares under the conditions set out in
articles L. 225-209 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the provisions of the European Commission Regulation
596/2014 of 16 April 2014, which apply directly.

The following applies in respect of the programme:

the purchase price per share must not exceed €21, it being stipulated that the Board may nevertheless adjust this
purchase price should transactions occur giving rise to an increase in the nominal value of ordinary shares or the creation
and grant of free shares, as well as a decrease of the nominal value of the ordinary shares or the consolidation of ordinary
shares or any other transaction affecting equity in order to reflect the impact of such transaction on the value of the
ordinary shares;

the maximum proportion of the share capital authorised by shareholders at the Getlink SE Combined General Meeting
of 30 April 2020 for purchase under the buyback programme is limited to 10% of the total ordinary shares composing
Getlink SE’s share capital at the time;

the maximum amount of funds allocated for the purchase of ordinary shares under this programme may not, based on
the number of shares in issue at 26 February 2020, exceed €1,155,000,000 (corresponding to a maximum of 55,000,000
ordinary shares at a maximum price of €21 per share, as stated above).

The transactions carried out by Getlink SE within the scope of the 2020 buyback programme may be effected with a view to
any allocation permissible by law or that may become permissible by the law, in particular for the following purposes:

to deliver shares upon the exercise of rights attached to negotiable securities giving the right by reimbursement,
conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means to the allocation of ordinary shares in the company;

to implement (i) share option schemes or (ii) free shares plans or (iii) the granting of ordinary shares purchased by the
company under this resolution, to the benefit of employees participating in a company savings plan under the conditions
provided by articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Employment Code, or under a transfer or grant of ordinary shares,
including under an employee saving plan, including for the purposes of a Share Incentive Plan in the United Kingdom,
or (iv) the granting of shares or any other form of allotment, allocation, sale or transfer to employees and/or executive
officers of Getlink SE or any entity connected thereto, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulation in force;

to maintain an active market in the name of Getlink within the context of a liquidity contract entered into in accordance
with a securities ethics charter recognised by the AMF; and

to reduce the capital of the company by way of cancellation of shares pursuant to resolution 22 or any similar
authorisation.

**7.3.2** **SUMMARY OF TRANSACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY GETLINK SE ON ITS OWN SECURITIES UNDER THE BUYBACK**

**PROGRAMME APPROVED BY THE COMBINED GENERAL MEETING ON 30 APRIL 2020**

Between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2020, Getlink SE bought back 150,000 ordinary shares under the buyback
programme.

On 31 December 2020, Getlink SE held[45] 11,595,861 of its own ordinary shares, mainly to cover stock option (196,455) and
free share plans (434,750), for the exercise of rights attached to preference shares into ordinary shares (2,794,233), free share
plans subject to performance conditions in which the shares are not yet vested (260,000) and reserved for subsequent use
in exchange or payment in connection with possible external growth transactions (7,728,156), as well as the cancellation of
shares by application of the General Meeting authorisations (182,267). These treasury shares represented 2.11% of
Getlink SE’s share capital at 31 December 2020, with a nominal value of €4,638,344.40 and a value, based on the average
purchase price (€8.831), of €102,407,160 not including the liquidity contract.

**7.4** **MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS**

**7.4.1** **MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS**

As at 31 December 2020 and as at the date of this Universal Registration Document, Getlink SE’s share capital comprised
550,000,000 ordinary shares and the theoretical number of voting rights to be used to determine the thresholds was
717,548,158. The total number of exercisable voting rights in General Meeting was 705,569,335.

The difference:

between the theoretical number of voting rights and the number of exercisable voting rights at General Meetings arises
from the treasury shares held by Getlink SE as part of its share buyback programme described in section 7.3.1 of this
Universal Registration Document, which do not carry voting rights; and

between the number of shares comprising the share capital and the theoretical number of voting rights arises from
double voting rights granted to shareholders holding their shares in registered form as indicated in section 8.3.4 of this
Universal Registration Document.

The distribution of Getlink SE’s share capital is as follows:

**Atlantia S.p.A**

By letter received on 2 March 2018, the Italian law company Atlantia S.p.A. (Via Antonio Nibby 20, Rome, Italy), declared to
the AMF (AMF declaration no 218C0532) that its holding had on 2 March 2018 indirectly crossed above the thresholds of
5%, 10% and 15% of the capital and voting rights and 20% and 25% of the voting rights of the company Getlink SE and that
it indirectly held, via the intermediary of the Luxembourg law S.à.r.l company Aero I Global & International that it controls,
85,170,758 Getlink SE shares representing 170,341,516 voting rights, i.e. 15.49% of the capital and 26.66% of the voting
rights, based on a capital consisting of 550,000,000 shares representing 639,030,648 voting rights. These crossings of
thresholds result from the acquisition by Atlantia S.p.A. of the entire share capital of Aero I Global & International, which
held 85,170,758 Getlink SE shares representing 170,341,516 voting rights.

**TCI Fund Management Limited**

In a letter received on 25 March 2020, The Children's Investment Master Fund[46 ](7 Clifford Street, London W1S 2FT, United
Kingdom) declared to the AMF (AMF declaration no 220C1115) that its holding had on 19 March 2020 individually crossed
above the threshold of 15% of the voting rights in Getlink SE and that on that date it individually held 55,863,762 Getlink
SE shares representing 105,143,213 voting rights i.e. 10.16% of the capital and 15.001% of the voting rights of Getlink SE,
based on a capital consisting of 550,000,000 shares representing 700,908,869 voting rights, pursuant to the second
paragraph of article 223-11 of the general regulations. This threshold crossing results from an acquisition of Getlink SE shares
on the market.

On that occasion, TCI Fund Management Limited[47] (7 Clifford Street, London W1S 2FT, United Kingdom), acting on behalf of
clients and funds under its management, did not cross any threshold and holds, as at 19 March 2020, on behalf of the said
clients and funds, 68,970,574 Getlink SE shares representing 129,919,317 voting rights i.e. 12.54% of the share capital and

Pursuant to article L. 233-9, I, 4°bis of the French Commercial Code and article 223-14 V of the general regulations, The
Children's Investment Master Fund has specified that, as at 20 March 2020, it held by assimilation 1,052,937 Getlink SE shares
(included in the holding referred to in the first paragraph), resulting from the holding of a cash-settled equity swap contract,
exercisable at any time until 9 September 2021.

By the same letter, the following statement was made: “The acquisition of shares and equity swaps in Getlink SE by TCI Fund
Management Limited is in the normal course of its investment service provider business conducted without the intention of
implementing any particular strategy in relation to Getlink SE nor exercising any specific influence over the management of
Getlink SE. TCI Fund Management Limited is not acting in concert with any third party and does not intend to take control
of Getlink SE. TCI Fund Management Limited does not intend to seek the appointment of TCI Fund Management Limited
nor one or more persons as a director, member of the management board or supervisory board.”

**Eiffage SA**

By letter received on 21 December (2020), the company Eiffage SA (3/7 place de l’Europe, 78140 Vélizy-Villacoublay, France)
declared to the AMF (AMF declaration no 220C5493) that its holding had on 18 December 2020 indirectly, through the
intermediary of the SAS company Dervaux Participations 14, which Eiffage SA controls, crossed above the threshold of 5%
of the capital of Getlink SE and that it holds 27,934,992 Getlink SE shares representing 54,833,276 voting rights i.e. 5.08% of
the capital and 7.95% of the voting rights, based on capital comprising 550,000,000 ordinary shares representing 690,028,178
voting rights, pursuant to the second paragraph of article 223-11 of the general regulations. This threshold crossing results
from an allocation of double voting rights.

To the best of the company’s knowledge no other shareholder directly or indirectly or acting in concert with another party
holds more than 5% of the capital or voting rights.

**7.4.2** **CONTROL**

With regard to the crossing of thresholds, legal and regulatory obligations apply. Getlink SE’s Articles of Association do not
contain any obligations other than the legal thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 33⅓%, 50%, 66⅔%, 90% and 95%
of the capital and of the voting rights.

The Articles of Association of Getlink SE contain no provisions whereby a change of control of Getlink SE can be delayed,
deferred or prevented. Getlink SE is aware of no agreements that could bring about restrictions in the transfer of shares or
the exercise of voting rights.

Apart from the double voting rights described in section 8.3.4 of this Universal Registration Document, there are no specific
voting rights attached to any Getlink SE shares. However, the D and E preference shares, referred to in section 8.3.2 of this
Universal Registration Document, do not carry voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary general shareholders’ meetings
for holders of ordinary shares, although it should be noted that they do carry voting rights at special shareholders’ meetings
for holders of D and E preference shares.

To the best of the knowledge of Getlink SE, and apart from regulatory constraints, there are no agreements that, if
implemented, could bring about a change of control of Getlink SE at a later date.

**7.5** **TRAVEL PRIVILEGES**

Getlink SE offers its shareholders a travel privilege programme for Passenger Shuttle crossings. This programme offers a 30%
reduction on the standard fare up to a limit of six one-way tickets (equivalent to three return tickets) per year. Shareholders
holding at least 750 ordinary shares continuously for more than three months are eligible for the programme. Getlink SE’s
Board has renewed this programme on identical terms for a new period of three years until 31 December 2022.

The general conditions of this travel privilege programme are available on the Group’s website www.getlinkgroup.com.

-----

**8.1** **REGULATORY FRAMEWORK**

The Tunnel is governed by Franco-British agreements (the Treaty of Canterbury, signed on 12 February 1986 and the
Concession Agreement of 14 March 1986 set out in section 8.2 of this Universal Registration Document) and by the relevant
European rules and regulations and Franco-British binational transposition regulations.

The Treaty of Canterbury, which authorised the construction and operation of the Fixed Link by private concessionaire
companies, prohibits the use of government funds. Accordingly, since the Concessionaires do not benefit from public funds
they are not bound by the separation obligations imposed on the railway companies and on the infrastructure managers in
respect of their activities. These obligations are intended to prevent possible cross-subsidies between activities financed by
public funds and other activities, mainly competitive ones.

The operation of the Fixed Link is subject to detailed regulations drawn up by the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) and
the IGC Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, which have been set up pursuant to the Treaty of Canterbury to monitor, on behalf
of the States, all issues related to the construction and operation of the Tunnel. The Fixed Link is governed by bilateral
agreements between France and the United Kingdom (presented in sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 of this Universal Registration
Document) as well as by constantly evolving European regulation, which includes in particular the European rail directives[48].

**8.1.1** **EUROPEAN LEGISLATION: THE RAILWAY PACKAGES**

The promotion of more efficient and sustainable modes of transport has been an essential part of European Union policy
for 25 years. In the rail sector, European legislation has strongly influenced national legislation with a view to enhancing the
competitiveness of the sector vis-à-vis other modes of transport, improving the integration of the different rail networks and
the efficiency of rail transport services. EU policy objectives have been translated into a series of legislative measures (the
"railway packages") aimed mainly at opening up the rail freight and passenger markets, ensuring non-discriminatory access,
and promoting railway interoperability and safety.

**Railway packages**

Directive 91/440/EEC of 29 July 1991 laid down the first set of principles:

railway undertakings must have a budget and accounts separate from those of the Member State;

for greater transparency and better performance assessment, the railway infrastructure and the operation of transport
services must have separate accounts, although this principle does not require the creation of a dedicated infrastructure
entity. The Concessionaires do not receive public funds, are not railway companies and are not subject to the separation
obligation. This derogatory status is enshrined by article 2.9 of the 2012/34/EU Directive of 21 November 2012 and
Directive 2016/2370/EU Directive of 4 December 2016 (4[th] railway package) has confirmed the exemption for the Group’s
Shuttle Services.

This 1991 Directive has been supplemented by two Directives:

Directive 95/18 on the licensing of railway undertakings;

Directive 95/19 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity (allocation of train paths) and the levying of charges
for the use of infrastructure.

European legislation then sought to liberalise the sector by “packages”, i.e. rules adopted simultaneously in stages.

The first railway package

The first railway package, known as the “railway infrastructure package”, was adopted in February 2001. It introduces a limited
opening up of rail freight. Directive 2001/12 amends Directive 91/440/EEC and provides for the opening up of freight on the
trans-European rail freight network (main lines). Directive 2001/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26
February 2001 amends the European Union Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings. Directive
2001/14 concerns the allocation of capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety
certification.

48 Directives 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area and 2016/2370/EU amending the aforementioned Directive as regards
the opening up of the market in domestic passenger transport services by rail and the governance of railway infrastructure. Directive
2012/34/EU lays down the excepted status of the Fixed Link as an integrated transport system in article 2.9: “This Directive shall not
apply to undertakings the business of which is limited to providing solely shuttle services for road vehicles through undersea tunnels or
to transport operations in the form of shuttle services for road vehicles through such tunnels except Article 6(1) and (4) and Articles 10,
11, 12 and 28.”


-----

The second railway package

The second railway package was adopted in April 2004. It completes the liberalisation of rail freight. Directive 2004/49/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 concerns the safety of the Community's railways and provides
for the establishment in each Member State of a national safety authority and a permanent accident investigation body.
Directive 2004/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amends the previous Directives on the
interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and the interoperability of the trans-European conventional
rail system. Directive 2004/51/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 opens to competition the
transport of goods on the entire international rail network on 1 January 2006 and on the national market on 1 January 2007.
EC Regulation No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 establishes, among other things,
a European Railway Agency responsible for proposing measures for the progressive harmonisation of safety rules and for
drawing up technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs).

The third railway package

The third railway package, adopted in October 2007, opens up international passenger transport to competition. Directive
2007/58/EC sets 1 January 2010 as the latest date for opening up international passenger transport. The other texts concern
the certification of train drivers (Directive 2007/59/EC).

The revision of the first railway package (adopted in November 2012)

Directive 2012/34/EU merges the three directives of the "first railway package" and its main objective is to simplify and clarify
existing legislation in order to better regulate access to infrastructure and strengthen regulation of the sector. This directive
has been transposed into French national law, notably by Order no 2015-855 of 15 July 2015 pursuant to article 38 of law
no 2014-872 of 4 August 2014 on railway reform by Decree no 2016-1468 of 28 October 2016.

The fourth railway package

The objective of the Fourth Railway Package is to remove the remaining obstacles to the creation of a single European railway
area. The package consists of two pillars. The technical pillar consists of three texts which entered into force on 15 June 2016:

Regulation No 2016/796 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the European Union Railway
Agency and repealing Regulation No 881/2004;

Directive 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the interoperability of the rail
system within the European Union; and

Directive 2016/798 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on railway safety.

Directive 2016/2370/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2016 (4[th] railway package) has
confirmed the exemption for the Group’s Shuttle Services. The Concessionaires do not receive public funds, are not railway
companies and are not subject to the separation obligation. This Directive exempts the Fixed Link as a public-private
partnership not in receipt of public funds from the prohibition on intra-group financial flows.

The “Interoperability” and “Safety” Directives have been transposed into French national law by Decree no. 2019-525 of 27
May 2019 relating to the safety and interoperability of the railway system for the implementation of the single safety
certificate in particular. Three texts published on 23 December 2016 concern the amendment of EC Regulation no 1371/2007,
which provides in particular for the opening up of public passenger transport services by rail, and the amendment of Directive
2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area, which provides for the opening up of open access passenger
transport services from 14 December 2020 and reinforces the guarantees of the independence of the infrastructure manager.

**8.1.2** **SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES**

Taking account of changes in European law has led the French legislator to change the organisation of the rail system by
creating:

in 2006, the Établissement Public de Sécurité Ferroviaire (EPSF) which is responsible for compliance with safety and
interoperability rules for rail transport on the national railway network;

in 2009, the Direction de la circulation ferroviaire (DCF), a structure within the SNCF whose mission is to manage traffic
and technical studies for the allocation of train paths, which remains the sole responsibility of RFF;

in 2009, ART (the French transport regulatory authority, formerly ARAFER), which is responsible for ensuring effective
regulation in rail transport to allow non-discriminatory access to the rail network for all operators (law no. 2009-1503 of
8 December 2009 on the organisation and regulation of rail transport, known as the “ORTF law”).

Concerning more specifically rail freight transport, the European Union has encouraged the creation of a European rail freight
network.


-----

**Transposition to the Tunnel**

Under article 30 of Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the allocation of railway
infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification, Member States
are required to set up a regulatory body for the railway sector. The Treaty of Canterbury, which is the founding act of the
Tunnel and the Concession, established the IGC, responsible for monitoring, on behalf of the two governments and by
delegation from them, all matters relating to the operation of the Fixed Link.

In this capacity, the two States designated the IGC to act as the binational safety authority for the entire Fixed Link as part
of the transposition of article 30 of Directive 2001/14/EC, the binational regulation of 23 July 2009, concerning the use of
the Fixed Link, designated the IGC, presented in section 8.2.2.b of this Universal Registration Document, as the regulatory
body.

Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European
railway area provides that the economic regulation of the rail market is exercised by a single regulatory body per Member
State, whose independence from the States must be strengthened. According to article 55 of this Directive, the regulatory
body “shall be a stand-alone authority which is, in organisational, functional, hierarchical and decision making terms, legally
distinct and independent from any other public or private entity”.

A new bilateral regulation was signed in 2015 to transfer the competence for rail economic regulation from the IGC to the
two national regulatory bodies for the part of the Tunnel located in their respective territories. The two national regulatory
bodies, ART (the French transport regulatory authority, formerly ARAFER) and the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), concluded
a cooperation agreement to ensure cooperation based on reciprocity, transparency, compromise and trust. The aim of this
agreement is to define the guidelines for cooperation between the two authorities with a view to ensuring the economic
regulation of the Tunnel. It sets out the practical arrangements for cooperation between the two regulators.

The IGC continues to monitor, on behalf of the States, issues related to the construction and operation of the Tunnel as set
out in section 8.2.2.b of this Universal Registration Document.

**8.1.3** **BINATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK: BREXIT**

As set out in sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 of this Universal Registration Document, the Fixed Link is a binational infrastructure in
respect of which the French and British authorities conferred its operation to Eurotunnel in 1986 by means of a Concession.

Like any business with operations in the United Kingdom, the Group is faced with legal and regulatory uncertainty. Since
2019, the French government has made various orders that amended and waived measures in order to prepare for the United
Kingdom leaving the EU without an agreement based on article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.

**Railway safety**

By an order dated 13 February 2019 regarding preparations for the United Kingdom’s departure, the French government
indicated that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without an agreement the IGC would no longer be designated
as a binational safety authority by two member states but by one member state (France) and one third country (the United
Kingdom) so it might no longer be able to exercise the authority given by European law to a national safety authority. The
French government decided by means of the said order that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without an
agreement based on article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the national safety mission will be carried out by the
Établissement public de sécurité ferroviaire (EPSF – French public rail safety authority) for the French part of the Fixed Link.
This order was supplemented by a regulation adopted on 25 March 2019 by the European Parliament and the Council to
extend the validity of safety approvals, safety certificates, operating licences and train driver licences for a period of nine
months from the date of exit without an agreement.

The above regulations have lapsed due to the conclusion of a Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the
European Union.

On 21 October 2020, the European Parliament and Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2020/1530 and Decision (EU) 2020/1531
amending Directive (EU) 2016/798 relating to the application of railway safety and interoperability rules on the Fixed Link
and authorising France to negotiate, sign and conclude an international agreement supplementing the Treaty of Canterbury.

As at 31 December 2020, the international agreement referred to above has not been entered into, making it therefore
impossible for the IGC to maintain its status as a safety authority within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/798 on the part
of the Fixed Link located on European territory.

In parallel, the EPSF became the national safety authority on that part of the Fixed Link from 1 January 2021 on the basis of
article L. 2221-1 of the French Transport Code introduced by the law of 17 June 2020 relating to various provisions linked to
the public health crisis and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

Incidentally, the binational safety regulations have had their effects suspended on this same section and have been replaced,
as of 1 January, by Decree no. 2020-1821 of 29 December 2020 relating to rail safety and interoperability of the French part
of the Fixed Link and transposing the technical pillar of the 4[th] railway package.


-----

In order to allow and facilitate the continuity of rail services via the Fixed Link at the end of the Transition Period, on 23
December 2020 the European Parliament and the Council also adopted Regulation (EU) 2020/2222 on certain aspects of rail
safety and rail transport connectivity concerning cross-border infrastructure linking the Union and the United Kingdom via
the Fixed Link. This regulation extends the safety authorisation of Concessionaires in their capacity as infrastructure managers
operating the shuttle transport system from 1 January 2021 for a period of two months as well as the safety certificates and
operating licences of railway undertakings using the Fixed Link for a period of nine months.

**Economic regulation of the railways**

The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union has not resulted in any changes to the regulatory framework applicable
to the economic regulation of railways jointly carried out by ART and ORR. However, it should be recalled that those bodies’
directives may be subject to change and interpretation by administrative authorities and courts and the associated
regulations could even be significantly tightened by national or European authorities. This cooperation between the two
bodies could lead to a risk of discrepancy between the laws and the interpretation of the texts and even more so in the
context of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, which for example affects the structure of rail infrastructure
tariffs and thus the revenues of the Eurotunnel segment.

**8.2** **MATERIAL CONTRACTS**

Other than the material agreements described in this section, the Group’s business activity is not dependent on any industrial,
commercial or financial contract. Furthermore, the Group’s business is not dependent on any patent or licence agreement.

**8.2.1** **THE TREATY OF CANTERBURY**

The principal purpose of the Treaty of Canterbury, signed on 12 February 1986 by France and the United Kingdom in the
presence of François Mitterrand, President of the French Republic, and Margaret Thatcher, British Prime Minister, is to
authorise the construction and operation of the Fixed Link by private concessionaire companies, without any government
funds.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Canterbury, the States guarantee FM and CTG, as Concessionaires, under national and EU
law, freedom to determine their commercial policy, tariffs and the nature of the services they offer to customers.

The Treaty of Canterbury also includes various other provisions relating to the Fixed Link such as:

the establishment of the IGC, created by the Treaty of Canterbury to monitor in the name and on behalf of the
governments of the United Kingdom and the French Republic all questions relating to the construction and use of the
Fixed Link;

the establishment of the Safety Authority to advise and assist the IGC on all issues relating to the safety of the
construction and operation of the Fixed Link as set out in section 8.2.2 b below.

the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to settle disputes between the States and the Concessionaires relating to the
Concession Agreement;

the taxation by the two States of profits and revenues generated by the construction and operation of the Fixed Link is
governed by applicable legislation, including any double taxation treaties for the prevention of tax evasion in force
between the two States and relating to direct taxes, together with any related protocols;

compliance by the two States with the principle of non-discrimination with respect to taxes relating to charges payable
by customers of other directly competing modes of crossing the Channel;

the absence of any withholding tax by the two States on the transfer of funds and financial payments required for the
operation of the Fixed Link, either between the two States, or coming from or going to other countries, other than the
general taxation of payments represented by such transfers or financial payments; and

the commitment of the States to cooperate in a number of areas, including defence, security, policing, border controls,
interpretation or application of the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement.


-----

**8.2.2** **THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT**

The Concession Agreement was signed on 14 March 1986 between the States and the Concessionaires, pursuant to the
Treaty of Canterbury.

Initially entered into for a period of 55 years, the Concession Agreement was extended by 10 years and then 34 years by
successive amendments dated, respectively, 29 June 1994 and 29 March 1999, duly ratified by legislative provisions in France
and the United Kingdom. The term of the Concession Agreement was therefore extended first from 55 to 65 years, then from
65 to 99 years and expires in 2086.

Pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement, the Concessionaires have the right and the obligation, jointly and
severally, to design, finance, construct and operate the Fixed Link, and the Concessionaires do so at their own risk and without
any government funds or state guarantees regardless of the risks that may materialise during the performance of the
Concession Agreement. In particular, the Concessionaires are solely liable for any loss or damage caused to users of the
Fixed Link or third parties resulting from its operation.

Accordingly, the principal obligations of the Concessionaires under the Concession Agreement are:

to operate and maintain the Fixed Link and employ all means necessary to permit the continuous and fluid flow of traffic
in safe and convenient conditions; and

to comply with applicable laws and regulations in relation to the operation of the System and in particular in relation to
customs, immigration, security, sanitary and road transport controls and rescue services.

The Fixed Link is an integrated transport system comprising shuttle services for road vehicles (for cars and trucks) and railway
network services (for passenger and rail freight trains) with no internal transactions between the two activities. The principle
of uniqueness of the Concession arises from clause 2.2 of the Concession Agreement, which states that “[t]he Fixed Link shall
include the ancillary installations, connections to the existing transport network and all plant, machinery, movable and
immovable equipment and railway shuttle rolling stock, necessary for safe and efficient operation between the
two terminals”.

Given the specific nature of the project and its financing, the Fixed Link has a special status. As set out in section 8.1.1 of this
Universal Registration Document, Directive 2016/2370/EU of 4 December 2016 (4th railway package) has confirmed the
exemption for Eurotunnel’s Shuttle Services.

**a)** **Tariffs and commercial policy**

The Concessionaires are free to set their fares. National laws relating to price and fare controls by public authorities do not
apply to the Fixed Link. However, these provisions are without prejudice to the application of national or EU rules relating to
competition and abuse of dominant positions. The Concessionaires must not discriminate between users of the Fixed Link,
in particular with respect to their nationality or direction of travel. They may however adjust tariffs in accordance with normal
commercial practices.

**b)** **Role of the IGC**

The IGC, established by the Treaty of Canterbury, was created to monitor, on behalf and with the authority of the States, all
issues relating to the construction and operation of the System. The IGC is made up of representatives of each of the States
on an equal basis.

The IGC acts as concession authority vis-à-vis the Group on behalf of and under the control of the States, and its duties in
this regard are:

to supervise the construction and operation of the System;

to take decisions on behalf of the States in relation to the performance of the Concession Agreement, including the right
to impose penalties on the Concessionaires in the event of a breach of their obligations under the Concession Agreement;

to consider the proposals of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority;

to prepare or participate in the preparation of all regulations applicable to the System and monitor their application,
including those in relation to maritime and environmental matters; and

to issue advice and recommendations concerning the States and the Concessionaires.

As set out in section 8.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document, the functions of the independent railway control body
for the economic regulation of the Fixed Link’s railway activities provided for in the European Union Directive 2012/34 were
conferred on ART in France and on its British counterpart, the ORR.

As indicated in section 8.1.3 of this Universal Registration Document, on 31 December 2020 the IGC was not retained in its
capacity as safety authority within the meaning of Directive 2016/798/EU on the part of the Fixed Link located on European
territory, which had the effect of making the EPSF competent for the same section.


-----

**c)** **Penalties**

Any failure by the Concessionaires to perform their obligations under the Concession Agreement shall entitle the States to
impose penalties, but no other measure under the Concession Agreement.

Should a breach be identified by the IGC, it would inform the Concessionaires in writing, specifying the nature and subject
of the breach. After the Concessionaires have been heard, the IGC may issue a formal notice to remedy the breach within a
sufficiently long period of time which may not be less than 30 days.

If at the end of such period, the Concessionaires have not remedied the breach identified by the IGC, it may impose a penalty
on the basis of a fixed initial daily sum of between 10,000 and 100,000 ecus at 1986 values (changed to euros at a rate of
one to one on 1 January 1999) and proportionate to the seriousness of the breach giving rise to the penalty.

**d)** **Early termination of the Concession Agreement and compensation**

Each party to the Concession Agreement may request the arbitration tribunal, established pursuant to the Treaty of
Canterbury, to declare the termination of the Concession Agreement in exceptional circumstances, such as war, invasion,
nuclear explosion or natural disaster. In such cases, in principle, no compensation is owed to the Concessionaires. However,
the States may pay the Concessionaires an amount representing the financial benefits, if any, that they may derive from such
termination.

Each of the States may terminate the Concession for reasons of national defence. In such case, the Concessionaires may
claim compensation under the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Canterbury. The Treaty of Canterbury specifies that such
compensation shall be governed by the law of the relevant State.

Each of the States may terminate the Concession Agreement in the event of a fault committed by the Concessionaires. The
Concession Agreement defines a fault as a breach of a particularly serious nature of the obligations under the Concession
Agreement or ceasing to operate the Fixed Link. The States may issue a formal notice to the Concessionaires giving them a
period of three months, which may be extended up to a maximum period of six months, to remedy the breach. This formal
notice is also sent to the lenders that financed the construction and operation of the Fixed Link. If, within such period, the
Concessionaires have not remedied the breaches complained of, the States may terminate the Concession Agreement,
subject to giving prior notice to the lenders of their right of substitution.

Any termination of the Concession Agreement by the States, other than in a situation described above, gives the
Concessionaires the right to payment of compensation. Such compensation shall be for the entire direct and certain loss
actually suffered by the Concessionaires and attributable to the States, within the limits of what can reasonably be estimated
at the date of the termination, including the damage suffered and operating losses. To calculate this compensation, account
is taken of the share of liability of the Concessionaires, if any, in the events which led to the termination.

**e)** **Assignment and substitution by lenders**

The Concession Agreement provides that each of the Concessionaires has the right to transfer the Concession Agreement
or the rights it confers, with the agreement of the States.

In addition, upon the occurrence of one of the events set out below, and for as long as the effects of the event persist, or
any other action or intention that could lead to the termination of the Concession Agreement, the lenders, approved as such
by the States pursuant to the Concession Agreement (the “Lenders”) may request of the States that substitution be operated
in favour of entities controlled by them (referred to as the “Substituted Entities” in the Concession Agreement) if:

(i) the Concessionaires fail to pay, within a contractual grace period, any sum due and payable under the terms of the
finance documents,

(ii) the Concessionaires do not have and cannot procure sufficient funds to finance the forecasted operating costs of the
Fixed Link, and the related finance charges,

(iii) it appears that the date of full and final payment of all receivables of the Lenders must be postponed for a significant

length of time, or

(iv) in the event of the Fixed Link being abandoned, insolvency, liquidation, enforcement of security by other creditors and

related events.

The Substituted Entities must prove to the States, at the time of the substitution, that they have sufficient technical and
financial capacity to continue performance of the Concession Agreement.

The amendment to the Concession Agreement dated 29 March 1999 granted an extension to the term of the Concession
Agreement for the sole benefit of the Concessionaires, such that the extension would not apply if the Lenders exercised their
Substitution Right.

In accordance with article 32 of the Concession Agreement, the lenders of the Term Loan (and equivalents) have been
approved by the States as Lenders able to benefit from the Substitution Right under the terms set out in the Concession
Agreement.


-----

**f)** **Taxation and sharing of profits**

Taxation and customs matters are decided by the States in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Canterbury. If it
appears that changes in tax or customs legislation have a discriminatory effect on the Fixed Link, the relevant State will
examine the issue with the Concessionaires. Furthermore, in accordance with article 19 of the Concession Agreement, as a
matter of principle, the Concessionaires share equally between CTG and FM at cost price all expenses and all revenues from
the Fixed Link for the period during which they operate it. To this end, the consequences of any indirect taxation on the
supply of goods or services levied only on one of the Concessionaires will be taken into account in the costs to be shared.
Any equalising payment made between FM and CTG will be treated as a capital expense or a revenue payment as determined
by the tax legislation of the two States.

With respect to the period between 2052 and 2086, the Concessionaires will be obliged to pay to the States a total annual
sum, including all corporate taxes of any kind whatsoever, equal to 59% of all pre-tax profits.

**g)** **Litigation**

Disputes relating to the application of the Concession Agreement must be submitted to an arbitration tribunal which will
apply the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Canterbury and the Concession Agreement. Provisions of French or English law
may, if necessary, be applied, if this is dictated by the performance of specific obligations under French or English law.
Relevant principles of international law and, if the parties so agree, the principles of equity may be applied.

**8.2.3** **RAILWAY USAGE CONTRACT**

The Railway Usage Contract was entered into on 29 July 1987 between the Concessionaires and the Railways (BRB and SNCF)
at the same time as the Treaty of Canterbury was ratified and the Concession came into force. It sets out the basis on which
the Concessionaires allow the trains using the Railway Network to use the Fixed Link, from the date the Railway Usage
Contract came into force until 2052. It also specifies the conditions under which the Railways undertake and are authorised
to use the Fixed Link with arrangements for the development of certain services and the installation of certain railway
infrastructure and the rolling stock necessary to ensure a sufficient level and quality of traffic in the Tunnel. Likewise, the
Concessionaires subscribe to a number of commitments relating to maintenance of the Fixed Link. Pursuant to the Railway
Usage Contract, trains using the Railway Network are authorised to use up to 50% of the capacity of the Fixed Link per hour
and in each direction, up until 2052.

Under the terms of the Railway Usage Contract, the Railways are obliged to pay the Concessionaires variable charges
depending on the number of passengers travelling on passenger trains and the freight tonnage carried through the Fixed
Link, as well as fixed annual charges. Mechanisms to reduce the annual charges are set out in the event that the Fixed Link
is unavailable. Lastly, under the Railway Usage Contract, the Railways must pay a contribution to the Concessionaires’
operating costs and the renewal of the Fixed Link. To this end, the Railways make monthly provisional payments to the
Concessionaires against operating costs for the current period. Payments are subsequently adjusted to take account of real
operating costs, with the final amount of the contribution determined on the basis of the provisions set out in the Railway
Usage Contract, and agreements reached for its implementation.

The Railway Usage Contract is governed by French law.

In addition, as part of the strategy for the re-launch of freight services, in 2007 Eurotunnel decided to offer a simplified
pricing structure mechanism for goods trains, with a toll per freight train rather than per tonne of freight, based on a charging
regime published annually by Eurotunnel in the Fixed Link Network Statement.

A substantial part of the Group’s revenues emanating from the Railway Network is made up of the variable charges and
annual fixed charges referred to above.

In the context of the privatisation of the British railways, BRB entered into back-to-back contracts with certain entities,
including Network Rail, DB Cargo UK (formerly EWS and DB Schenker Rail UK) and Eurostar International Limited (formerly
Eurostar UK Limited), under the terms of which BRB delegated to those entities operational execution of some of its
obligations to the Concessionaires. As part of the agreement with the British and French governments regarding the
extension of the Concession Agreement until 2086, the Group undertook, under certain conditions, to work with the entities
to which execution of these obligations had been delegated, to ensure the development of passenger train services and
goods train services.

In accordance with EU directives governing the liberalisation of the international rail transport market, the Concessionaires
publish the Fixed Link Network Statement annually; this offers transparent and non-discriminatory conditions of access to
its Railway Network to all Railway Companies and the same tariff framework as that set out by the Railway Usage Contract.

**8.2.4** **THE TERM LOAN AND ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS**

FM and CTG entered into the Term Loan dated 20 March 2007 (as amended and updated from time to time, most recently
on 13 April 2018), under which credit facilities in a principal amount of £1,836.5 million and €2,188 million (the “Senior
Facilities”) were made available to FM and CTG on 28 June 2007 by Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and Deutsche Bank
A.G. (London Branch) (together, the “Initial Lenders”). The financing of the Senior Facilities was arranged by Goldman Sachs
International and Deutsche Bank AG (London Branch) (the “Main Lenders”).

For the purposes of the management of the Senior Facilities, these loans were securitised on 20 August 2007 with Channel
Link Enterprises Finance Plc (CLEF).

**a)** **Principal provisions of the Term Loan**

**Summary of the tranching and the financial conditions of the Term Loan**

The Senior Facilities consist of:

tranches A1, A2, A3 each denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate, indexed on inflation in the
United Kingdom;

tranches A4, A5, A6 each denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate, indexed on inflation in France;

a tranche B1 loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate;

a tranche B2 loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate;

a tranche C1A loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate, which will switch to a variable rate on 20
June 2029;

a tranche C1B loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate;

a tranche C2A loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate, which will switch to a variable rate on 20 June
2022;

a tranche C2B loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate, which will switch to a variable rate on 20 June
2027;

a tranche C2C loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate; and

a tranche C2D loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate.

The C tranches, bearing interest at a variable rate, are hedged as indicated in the paragraph “Hedging arrangements in
respect of the Term Loan” below.

The weighted average interest rate applicable to the Senior Facilities and payments relating to the servicing of debt under
the Term Loan, are detailed in note G to the consolidated financial statements in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration
Document.

The borrowings denominated in sterling have been made available to CTG and those in euros have been made available
to FM.

**Repayment of the Term Loan**

The funds borrowed under the Term Loan will be repayable in accordance with their respective repayment schedules.

Repayment of the tranche A loans began in 2018, 11 years after the start of availability of such loans and will be completed
at least 35 years after the date of signature of the Term Loan.

Repayment of the tranche B1 and B2 loans began in 2013, six years after the date on which the Term Loan was signed.

Repayment of the tranche C1 and C2 loans will begin 39 and 34 years respectively after the date on which such loans become
available and be completed in June 2050.

**Prepayment of the Term Loan**

The amounts borrowed under the Senior Facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at the instigation of the relevant borrower,
subject to the payment of certain market standard prepayment premia.

The amounts borrowed under the Senior Facilities may also be subject to mandatory prepayment, under certain conditions
and in certain proportions, in particular from funds arising from insurance proceeds, permitted asset transfers, expropriation
of such assets, compensation under the Concession Agreement and, in certain instances, excess cash flow.

If Eurotunnel does not meet certain financial targets, excess cash flow must (i) during the first years following drawdown on
the Senior Facilities, be paid into a secured account set up for prepayment of amounts lent under the Senior Facilities and
(ii) subsequently be used directly for such prepayment until Eurotunnel once again meets the above mentioned financial
targets.


-----

**Undertakings and prohibitions under the Term Loan**

The Term Loan includes certain undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for a loan of its nature, in particular
restrictions relating to:

the creation or maintenance of liens on Eurotunnel’s assets;

the sale or transfer of Eurotunnel’s assets and the acquisition by Eurotunnel of new assets;

the granting of loans, securities or guarantees for the benefit of third parties; and

the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent under the Term Loan, including inter alia the Railway
Usage Contract.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan, Eurotunnel is required to meet the following financial covenants: at
each reference date, the debt-service coverage ratio must not be less than 1.10 since 28 June 2012. For the purposes of this
test, the ratio is calculated, on a rolling 12-month period, on a consolidated basis taking into account (i) as regards the
calculation of available cash flow for the servicing of debt, the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the Senior
Facilities, and (ii) as regards the calculation of debt servicing, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel has respected the debt-service coverage
ratio for 2020.

While the Term Loan restricts any increase in the financial indebtedness of Eurotunnel, it permits, amongst other items, (i) the
borrowing of revolving facilities, bonding facilities or guarantee facilities up to a maximum amount of €75 million (provided
that the relevant lender accedes to the Intercreditor Deed (as such term is defined in section “Agreement between Creditors”
below)) and (ii) indebtedness of up to £225 million of its Euro equivalent (provided that such indebtedness is unsecured and
structurally and (through the accession of the new lender(s) to the Intercreditor Deed) contractually subordinated to all
amounts payable under the Term Loan and that the ratings of the Term Loan are affirmed).

The Term Loan permits Eurotunnel to pay dividends, provided that such dividends are paid out of excess cash flow (as defined
in the Term Loan) or funds arising from a permitted disposal under the Term Loan (insofar as these funds do not have to be
allocated to mandatory prepayment) on the condition that no default is continuing under the Term Loan and that the
debt-service coverage ratio is not less than 1.25. For the purposes of this test, the ratio is calculated on the basis of a rolling
12-month period, on a consolidated basis, such consolidation to include (i) as regards the calculation of available cash flow
for the servicing of debt, the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the Senior Facilities and (ii) as regards the
calculation of debt service, Eurotunnel (with amortisation being calculated by reference to the greater of (i) the hypothetical
amortisation of the loan based on an annuity and (ii) the contractual amortisation). Failure to meet this ratio on a six-monthly
testing date would not constitute an event of default but would lead to restrictions on the use of Eurotunnel’s excess available
cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the Term Loan until such time as the test is met once again. If these
conditions are not met on an interest repayment date in connection with the Term Loan, the excess cash flow and funds will
be placed into an account dedicated to so-called “capex” expenditure. Failure to meet this test on three consecutive
six-monthly testing dates would trigger a prepayment event, under which Eurotunnel’s excess available cash flow would
have to be used towards prepayment of the Term Loan until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again.

**Event of default and acceleration**

The Term Loan contains a number of events of default which, in certain instances subject to grace periods, enable the lenders
to declare the Term Loan immediately due and payable, to enforce the liens described below or to demand the start of the
substitution mechanism provided for under the terms of the Concession Agreement and described in section 8.2.2 of this
Universal Registration Document.

The events of default include in particular:

any failure to pay under the Term Loan;

a failure to comply with any provision of the Term Loan, the Intercreditor Agreement or related documents. These
provisions impose limits relative to indebtedness, acquisitions, sales and other transfers, mergers, loans, guarantees and
the granting of new securities by the member companies of Eurotunnel, and include in particular:
(i) a financial commitment pursuant to which Eurotunnel Holding SAS is obliged to ensure that at each half-yearly test

date subsequent to 31 December 2017, the ratio of cash flow from operational activities over the total cost of
servicing the debt resulting from the Senior Facilities is not below 1.10, the said ratio being calculated by reference
to the 12-month period preceding the date of the test; and
(ii) certain commitments related to the tax treatment of the Group and where non-compliance is reasonably likely to

substantially affect the financial situation of FM, CTG or Eurotunnel;

a declaration or statement made or deemed to have been made by a borrower or a guarantor in relation to the Term
Loan, or any other financial document related to it or any other document presented by or on behalf of a borrower or a
guarantor in relation to the said financial documents (which contain the declarations and statements that are usual for
this type of financing), which proves to have been erroneous or misleading at the time when it was made or deemed to
have been made;

the occurrence of a cross default under any other indebtedness (greater than a certain amount) of any of the companies
within Eurotunnel;

the inability of any borrower or guarantor to pay its debts as they fall due, the insolvency or the opening of any legal
proceedings in relation to any borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan;

the illegality or invalidity of the Term Loan, any related liens or the subordination created under the Intercreditor
Agreement;


-----

the permanent impossibility of carrying on the business of operating the Tunnel, or the destruction of the Tunnel, or the
cessation of a substantial part of its activities by a borrower or a guarantor;

a guarantor ceases to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eurotunnel Holding SAS;

any act or omission of France or the United Kingdom which renders a borrower or guarantor under the Term Loan
incapable of performing its obligations under the Term Loan and related documents; and

the occurrence of litigation (or similar proceedings) against any Eurotunnel member company or its assets, which is
reasonably likely to be adversely determined against the relevant company and to have a substantial adverse effect on
the financial position of FM, CTG or Eurotunnel.

The Term Loan also includes other events of default that are usual for this type of funding.

In the context of the public health crisis and as a precautionary measure, on 17 October 2020, the Group secured a waiver
on this covenant from its creditors which will apply for the three test dates between December 2020 and December 2021
inclusive, unless the Group decides that such a waiver is not required no later than two months before one of the dates in
question. The waiver is subject to certain conditions, including the holding of a minimum cash balance at the level of the
Eurotunnel sub-group of €200 million at the relevant dates.

**Hedging arrangements in respect of the Term Loan**

FM and CTG, prior to the drawdown under the Term Loan, entered into various hedging arrangements in order to hedge
their respective exposure to interest rate fluctuation in connection with their payment obligations under the Term Loan as
indicated in note G.1.2.c to the consolidated accounts figuring in section 2.2.1 of this Universal Registration Document.

During 2020, Deutsche Bank, which holds 50% of these hedging contracts, novated part of its portfolio of hedging contracts,
including those in place with the Group, to new counterparties. The transaction was concluded on 4 August 2020 and as a
result those of the Group’s hedging contracts that were previously held by Deutsche Bank were transferred to three new
counterparties. The terms and conditions of these hedging contracts remain unchanged following their novation, in
accordance with the terms of the credit agreements entered into in 2007.

**Agreement between creditors**

Prior to drawdown under the Term Loan, the Group entered into an intercreditor deed with its bank lenders and its
intra-group creditors (the “Intercreditor Deed”) pursuant to which the claims of all intra-group creditors are subordinated to
the claims of the bank lenders.

The Intercreditor Deed also provides for the security and the guarantees described below to be held by a Security Trustee
for the benefit of the lenders under the Term Loan, and, as the case may be, for the benefit of lenders under certain permitted
financial indebtedness acceding to the Intercreditor Deed.

**b)** **Guarantees and security relating to the Term Loan**

**Guarantees**

Under the Intercreditor Deed, Eurotunnel Holding SAS, FM, EFL, CTG, ESGIE, Eurotunnel SE, ESL, EurotunnelPlus Limited and
Gamond Insurance Company, the guarantors on the date of the corporate reorganisation in 2018 (the “Guarantors”), each
jointly and severally guarantee the commitments made by FM and CTG, in their capacity as borrowers under the Term Loan
vis-à-vis the Initial Lenders, the arrangers, the Agents and the hedging counterparties of the Term Loan.

The Term Loan provides that, following its execution, certain of the Group companies (other than the Guarantors) will be
required also to become guarantors of the Term Loan if, in particular, their contribution to the EBITDA, gross value of assets
or Eurotunnel revenue increases above a specified pre-determined threshold.

In order to guarantee their obligations as borrowers under the Term Loan and guarantors under the Intercreditor Deed, the
Guarantors have given various securities.

**Security granted by Eurotunnel under French law**

To secure their obligations as borrower under the Term Loan or guarantor under the Intercreditor Deed, the Guarantors
owning French assets have granted the following security:

assignment of trade receivables by way of guarantee under which (i) FM assigns its receivables under the Concession
Agreement and the Railway Usage Contract as well as its trade receivables owed by the freight transporters and coach
operators and its insurance receivables and intercompany receivables held by it on the French subsidiaries of the Group,
(ii) CTG assigns the same categories of receivables as FM with the exception of its trade receivables owed by the freight
transporters and coach operators, and (iii) other members of the Group qualifying as guarantor assign their insurance
receivables and intercompany receivables held against French companies of Eurotunnel;

unregistered mortgages over FM’s and CTG’s main real estate assets that are not the subject of short or medium-term
development projects;

a non-possessory lien over FM’s rolling stock;

a pledge on all bank and investment accounts open in France in the name of any borrower or guarantor under the
Term Loan;

a pledge on shares in the Eurotunnel members held by the borrowers or guarantors under the Term Loan;

a pledge on the main Eurotunnel trademarks;


-----

a pledge on receivables held by FM under certain pieces of land comprised in the “ZAC 1” and which is the subject of
long-term construction leases (baux à construction);

a pledge on receivables held by Eurotunnel Holding SAS against FM pursuant to the bonds facility agreement dated 28
June 2007 (as amended on 29 August 2007) and entered into, inter alia, Eurotunnel Holding SAS as lender and FM as
borrower; and

a pledge over their rights held in connection with the economic interest grouping (groupement d’intérêt économique or
GIE) by Eurotunnel Holding SAS, FM, CTG and Eurotunnel SE.

**Security granted by Eurotunnel under English law**

To secure their obligations as borrower under the Term Loan or guarantor under the Intercreditor Deed, the Guarantors have
each granted security over all of their assets held at the date of execution of the Term Loan as well as over their future assets.

**Security over the other Eurotunnel assets**

All of the shares of the Eurotunnel members that are not subject to security as described above have been pledged by way
of security for the obligations of the borrowers under the Term Loan and guarantors under the Intercreditor Deed.

**8.2.5** **SENIOR SECURED NOTES ISSUED AS GREEN BONDS**

Getlink SE issued €700 million 3.50% Senior Secured Notes (the “2025 Green Bonds”) on 30 October 2020 (the “Offering”).
The 2025 Green Bonds are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange (trading as Euronext Dublin) and are admitted
to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. The 2025 Green Bonds align with the International Capital Markets
Association’s (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018 and Loan Market Association’s (LMA) Green Loan Principles 2020 and
therefore they fall into the category of “green” financing.

The 2025 Green Bonds are governed by an English law trust deed (the “Trust Deed”) between Getlink SE and BNY Mellon
Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee for the holders of the 2025 Green Bonds.

The 2025 Green Bonds are due on 30 October 2025 and interest thereon is payable semi-annually in arrears on 30 June and
30 December of each year, commencing on 30 December 2020.

Pursuant to the Trust Deed, €25,252,500 was paid into a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) corresponding to one year of
interest on the 2025 Green Bonds and a one-year commitment fee on the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**Permitted use of proceeds of the Offering**

The Group (i) used a portion of the net proceeds therefrom to redeem its €550.0 million 3.625% Senior Secured Notes due
2023 and pay applicable redemption premium and accrued, but unpaid, interest thereon; and (ii) is allowed to use the
remaining portion of such net proceeds to finance capital expenditure in relation to ElecLink and/or other Eligible Green
Assets.

In accordance with its Green Finance Framework, Getlink will prepare and publish a Green Finance Allocation Report within
one year of the issuance of the 2025 Green Bonds and annually thereafter until full allocation of the amount equal to the net
proceeds of the Offering. This report will provide information on the allocation and environmental impact of the 2025 Green
Bonds issued.

**Security and ranking**

The 2025 Green Bonds are subject to an English law intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) between, inter
alios, Getlink SE and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as security agent. The 2025 Green Bonds are secured
by first ranking liens (the “Notes Security”) on (i) all shares in the capital of Eurotunnel Holding SAS and GET Elec Ltd; and (ii)
a debt service reserve account set up by the Group (the “DSRA”).

The 2025 Green Bonds:

are general senior obligations of Getlink SE;

rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior indebtedness of Getlink SE that is not expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the 2025 Green Bonds;

are secured on an equal and rateable basis with certain other pari passu obligations of Getlink SE by a first priority lien
on the Notes Security; provided, however, that pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of
any collection, sale, disposition or other realisation of the Notes Security received in connection with the exercise of
remedies will be applied first to repay any super senior liabilities prior to the 2025 Green Bonds and any other pari passu
obligations of Getlink SE;

rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Getlink SE;

are effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured indebtedness of Getlink SE to the extent of the value of the
Notes Security;

are effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of Getlink SE that is secured by liens on property or
assets that do not secure the 2025 Green Bonds, to the extent of the value of such property or assets so securing such
indebtedness; and


-----

are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including
interest payables, trade payables and lease obligations) of Getlink SE’s subsidiaries (including the Term Loan).

**Redemption**

**Optional redemption**

The 2025 Green Bonds may be redeemed at any time prior to 30 October 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any,
to the redemption date, plus the applicable “make whole” premium.

In addition, at any time prior to 30 October 2022, Getlink SE may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
the 2025 Green Bonds using the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price of 103.500% of the
principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any,
to the redemption date.

At any time on or after 30 October 2022, Getlink SE may redeem the 2025 Green Bonds at the following redemption prices,
expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on 30 October: 2022:
101.75%, 2023: 100.875% or without a premium in or after 2024.

The 2025 Green Bonds may also be redeemed upon the occurrence of certain tax events.

**Repurchase upon a change of control**

If an event treated as a change of control triggering event occurs, then each holder of the 2025 Green Bonds has the right
to require that Getlink SE repurchase all or part of such holder’s 2025 Green Bonds at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase.

**Mandatory redemption**

If Getlink SE disposes of its shares in Eurotunnel Holding SAS to a third party in accordance with the requirements of law or
a governmental authority, it shall apply the net cash proceeds of such disposal to (i) first, repay the amounts outstanding
under the Term Loan and (ii) second, redeem all outstanding 2025 Green Bonds at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase.

**Covenants**

The Trust Deed provides for certain incurrence covenants that are customary for this type of financing. These covenants are
only tested upon the occurrence of an event, rather than on an on-going basis. Unless certain conditions are respected,
certain prohibitions apply in relation to:

The incurrence of additional debt: for example, additional debt can be incurred as long as, on a pro forma basis, the
Group’s (a) Total Net Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than (i) 9.0 to 1.0 until, and including, 30 June 2022 and (ii) 8.0 to
1.0 from, and including, 1 July 2022; and (b) Debt Service Cover Ratio (DSCR) is equal to or greater than 1.25 to 1.0. In
addition, there are certain types of debt that can be incurred irrespective of whether there is ratio debt capacity at all.
These include a €100 million Revolving Credit Facility at Getlink SE of which €75 million was committed but undrawn as
at 31 December 2020; a €50 million basket to finance the activities of GET Elec Limited, ElecLink Ltd or any of their
respective subsidiaries; a €50 million basket to finance the activities of Europorte SAS or any of its subsidiaries; and a
basket of up to €400 million to finance the activities of Getlink SE or any of its subsidiaries.

The making of certain restricted payments, including dividend distributions and purchases of treasury shares. Any such
restricted payments will be permitted if (i) there is no event of default or ii) if the DSCR is greater than 1.25; and (iii) there
is sufficient cash on the DSRA. Any restricted payments using the proceeds of a Europorte sale and restricted payments
in the aggregate amount not to exceed €300 million (and €150 million in each year), are not subject to the DSCR
restriction above.

Other operations, including certain sales of assets, granting of certain liens and consummation of certain merger and
consolidation transactions.

As is customary for financings of this type, there are a number of exceptions to the incurrence covenants noted above that
are aimed to ensure that the Group has sufficient flexibility to operate its business.

In addition, the Trust Deed provides for the establishment of the DSRA and certain requirements as to crediting cash on it.


-----

**Events of default**

Key events of default applicable to the 2025 Green Bonds and listed in the Trust Deed are set out below:

a failure to pay principal when due;

a failure for more than 30 days to pay interest when due;

a failure for more than 60 days after receipt of a notice from the trustee or holders of at least 25% of the aggregate
principal amount of the 2025 Green Bonds outstanding to comply with other covenants or agreements in the Trust Deed;

a cross-acceleration or payment default under certain other indebtedness;

a failure to pay certain final judgments;

an impairment of Notes Security above a certain value; and

certain customary bankruptcy and insolvency events of default.

**8.2.6** **MASTER INTRA-GROUP DEBT AGREEMENT**

Intra-group debts existed between the various companies of the Group. Some of them were expressed in contracts
concluded between 2007 and 2009 for the financial restructuring or simplification of the structure of the Group (“Intra-Group
Debts”). Certain of these Intra-Group Debts for which contracts were concluded in 2007 were reorganised in 2009 as part of
the transactions prior to the merger of TNU SA into Getlink SE which gave rise to the conclusion of new contracts for
intra-group loans.

The Intra-Group Debts, because they were concluded over a period from 2007 to 2009 and partly re-organised in 2009, had
different characteristics as to interest rate and maturity which complicated the financial and accounting management of
Group companies.

Group companies have therefore concluded a contract entitled the “Master Intra-Group Debt Agreement” the principal
object of which is the harmonisation of (i) the rules for current accounts between Group companies, (ii) the interest rates of
the various Intra-Group Debts and (iii) where possible, the other conditions of these Intra-Group Debts in order to facilitate
the financial and accounting management of Group companies and to reflect the financial policy between the Group’s
companies.

**8.3** **CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENT AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION**

Getlink SE is governed by the French law provisions relating to sociétés anonymes with a board of directors, compatible with
the regulations relating to European companies.

**8.3.1** **CORPORATE PURPOSE (ARTICLE 2 OF GETLINK SE’S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION)**

The corporate purpose of Getlink SE is:

acquire equity interests by way of the purchase, subscription, transfer or exchange of corporate rights, shares, partnership
interests or otherwise, with any co-contracting party, French or foreign, in any company whose purpose is directly or
indirectly related to the operation of the Tunnel between France and Great Britain or any other fixed links, infrastructure
or transport activities;

participate in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, in any transactions connected with its corporate purpose via
the creation of new companies, the contribution, subscription or purchase of securities or corporate rights, merger or
otherwise, creation, acquisition, leasing, lease management of all businesses or establishments; taking, acquiring,
operating or selling any procedures or patents relating to its activities;

generally, all industrial, commercial, financial, civil, personal or real property transactions, directly or indirectly related to
any of the purposes referred to above or any similar or connected purposes, including in particular, any transport
business.


-----

**8.3.2** **RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHED TO THE SHARES (ARTICLE 11 OF GETLINK SE’S ARTICLES OF**

**ASSOCIATION)**

Ownership of an ordinary share implies acceptance of the terms of the Articles of Association of Getlink SE and of all decisions
taken by Getlink SE shareholders in General Meeting.

**Ordinary shares**

Subject to the provisions set out hereafter, each member of a general meeting is entitled to the same number of voting
rights and to cast the same number of votes as the number of fully paid-up ordinary shares that he owns or is representing.
However, each fully paid-up ordinary share that has been held by the same shareholder in registered form for two years will
carry a double voting right in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

In addition to voting rights, each ordinary share grants the right to a share in the ownership of the company’s assets, profits
and liquidation proceeds, in proportion to the fraction of the share capital that it represents.

**D preference shares**

The General Meeting of 18 April 2018 authorised the granting of a total of 1,500 D preference shares convertible into a
maximum of 1,500,000 ordinary shares subject to performance criteria. The definitive vesting of the ordinary shares is based
on achieving the following three cumulative performance criteria (with one being external to the Group and the two others
internal to the Group):

The external performance condition (the “TSR weighting”) is based on the average performance including dividends
(TSR) of the Getlink SE ordinary share over a period of three years compared to the performance of the Group sector
index GPR Getlink Index (40%).

The first **internal performance condition (the “EBITDA weighting”) is based on the Group’s financial performance,**
assessed by reference to the average rate of achievement of EBITDA over a period of three years covering 2018, 2019
and 2020 (50%). As set out in section 5.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document, a proposal will be made to the
General Meeting of 28 April 2021 that 2020 be neutralised for the assessment of the EBITDA criterion.

The second internal performance condition (the “CSR weighting”) is based on the CSR composite index (10%).

The conversion ratio will depend on the degree of achievement of performance. As set out in section 7.1.4 of this Universal
Registration Document, the D preference shares will be converted into ordinary shares at the end of the General Meeting to
be held on 28 April 2021 and the corresponding update of the Articles of Association will be proposed at the same meeting.

**E preference shares**

The General Meeting of 18 April 2019 authorised the granting of preference shares (E preference shares) convertible into
ordinary shares subject to performance criteria on identical terms to those for D preference shares. The number of ordinary
shares resulting from the conversion is capped at 1,000 ordinary shares per E share. The vesting period of one year expired
on 18 April 2020 and the issue of preference shares E was materially completed.

**8.3.3** **ALLOCATION OF PROFITS (ARTICLE 31 OF GETLINK SE’S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION)**

The following deductions are made from the profits of each financial year, minus any prior losses, in the order set out below:

at least 5% to constitute the reserve account required by law;

the amounts determined by the general meeting to constitute such reserves for which it determines the distribution and
use; and

the amounts that the general meeting decides to carry forward.

The balance, if any, shall be distributed among all of the shareholders in proportion to the number of ordinary shares held
by each of them.

If the balance sheet prepared during or at the end of the financial year and certified by the statutory auditors indicates that
Getlink SE, since the end of the previous financial year, after any necessary depreciation and reserves and after deducting
any previous losses and amounts required to constitute the necessary reserves pursuant to applicable laws or the Articles of
Association, has made a profit, interim dividends may be distributed before the accounts for the financial year have been
approved. The amount of the interim dividend may not exceed the amount of profit as defined above.

The conditions for the payment of dividends in cash are set by the General Meeting, or failing that, by the Board. Each E
preference share will have one distribution right equal to 1/1,000[th] of the distribution right. In the event of dissolution of
Getlink SE, each E preference share has a right to the liquidation proceeds in proportion to the share that its nominal amount
represents in share capital.

Payment of dividends in cash must be carried out within a maximum period of nine months following the end of the financial
year, unless extended by a court authorisation.


-----

**8.3.4** **MODIFICATIONS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ RIGHTS**

The modification of the Articles of Association requires the approval of an extraordinary general meeting in accordance with
the quorum and majority required by applicable laws and regulations.

**Notice of meeting (article 27 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

General meetings are convened in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

**Venue of meetings (article 27 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

General meetings are held at the registered office of Getlink SE or at any other place referred to in the notice of the meeting.

**Attendance at general meetings (article 27 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

Admission to participate at the General Meetings is subject to the registration of the shares under the shareholder’s name
or that of his/her financial intermediary, by midnight (Paris time) on the second business day preceding the date of the
General Meeting.

Any shareholder may attend general meetings in person or by proxy, regardless of the number of ordinary shares held, upon
providing proof of identity and proof of ownership of the ordinary shares, by registering the ordinary shares in the
shareholders’ name or in the name of the intermediary registered on his behalf, either in the registered accounts held by
Getlink SE, or in the bearer’s form accounts held by the authorised intermediary in accordance with the provisions of article
R. 225-85 of the French Commercial Code.

In accordance with article 4 of Order no. 2020-321 of 25 March 2020, issued in the context of the authorisation granted by
the emergency law no. 2020-290 of 23 March 2020 dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, Getlink's Combined General
Meeting of 30 April 2020 was held without the shareholders and other persons entitled to attend being present in person
or by telephone or audiovisual conference. In view of the order of 14 March 2020 (as supplemented by the order of 16 March
2020) on various measures relating to the fight against the spread of Covid-19 (prohibiting certain gatherings in particular),
the emergency Covid-19 law n° 2020-290 of 23 March 2020, order no. 2020-321 of 25 March 2020 adapting the rules for
meetings and deliberations of general meetings and boards of directors due to Covid-19 and the AMF press releases of 6
March and 27 March 2020 relating to shareholders' meetings of listed companies in the context of Covid-19, the shareholders
used the means made available to them by Getlink SE to participate in advance at a distance, without being physically
present, in this General Meeting[49].

E preference shares carry no voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary general meetings of holders of ordinary shares,
although they carry voting rights at special general meetings of holders of E preference shares.

**Use of electronic means of communication (article 27 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

If the Board so decides at the time the meeting is convened, any shareholder may participate and vote at general meetings
by video conference or any other electronic means of communication in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

For the purposes of calculating the quorum and majority, shareholders participating in the meeting by video conference or
another form of electronic communication enabling them to be identified, and the nature and conditions of application of
which are set in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, are deemed to be present.

**Representation at general meetings (article 27 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association and articles L. 225-106 et seq.**
**of the French Commercial Code)**

Pursuant to articles L. 225-106 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, shareholders may be represented at meetings by the
individual or legal entity of their choice under the conditions stipulated in current regulations. The proxy must prove his
authority in accordance with article L. 225-106 of the French Commercial Code. He is bound by the disclosure obligations
stipulated in current regulations. In addition, owners of securities referred to in the 3rd paragraph of article L. 228-1 of the
French Commercial Code may be represented by a registered intermediary in accordance with the provisions of article
L. 228-3-2 of the French Commercial Code.

Legal representatives of shareholders without legal capacity and individuals representing corporate shareholders may
participate in general meetings, whether or not they are shareholders.

Authority to act as a proxy may be given for one meeting only and shall be in respect of the agenda of that meeting only.
The authorisation must specify the meeting for which it is granted and provide necessary information to identify the ordinary
shares. Authority may however be given for two meetings, one ordinary and the other extraordinary, held on the same day
or within a fortnight of each other. The authority given for one meeting shall be valid for all successive meetings convened
with the same agenda. The proxy named in person on the proxy form may not substitute any other person.

All documents required by applicable laws and regulations must be attached to all proxy forms sent to shareholders.

49 In accordance with Decree No. 2021-955 of 9 March 2021, the general meeting of Getlink SE of 28 April 2021 will also be held behind

closed doors.


-----

The proxy form must be signed by the shareholder being represented and provide the last name, the first name, the address,
the number of ordinary shares owned and the number of votes attached to those ordinary shares. Only proxy forms which
have been received two days prior to the meeting will be taken into account by Getlink SE.

The intermediary referred to in article L. 228-1 of the French Commercial Code may, pursuant to a securities management
general mandate, send votes or powers of attorney on behalf of a shareholder as defined in article L. 228-1 of the French
Commercial Code for the purposes of a general meeting.

**Exercise of voting rights (article 27 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

All shareholders may vote by postal ballot under the conditions and within the time limits provided for by law by using a
form prepared by Getlink SE and sent to shareholders requesting the form and provided such forms reach Getlink SE two
days prior to the general meeting.

**Chairmanship of general meetings (article 27 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

General meetings of shareholders are chaired by the Chairman of the Board or, in his absence, by the most senior Director
present at the meeting. If the meeting has been convened by the statutory auditors, provisional liquidator or receivers, the
general meeting shall be chaired by the person, or one of those persons, who called the meeting.

**Quorum and majority at general meetings (articles 28 and 29 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

Ordinary, extraordinary, combined or special general meetings shall be subject to the quorum and majority conditions
provided by applicable laws and regulations governing such meetings and shall exercise the powers conferred on them by
law. The votes cast do not include those relating to ordinary shares for which the shareholder has not taken part in the vote
or has abstained or voted blank or invalid.

**Voting rights of holders of ordinary shares and double voting rights (article 11 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

Subject to the provisions set forth below, each member of a general meeting is entitled to as many voting rights and to cast
as many votes as the number of fully paid-up ordinary shares he owns or is representing.

However, each fully paid-up ordinary share which has been held by the same shareholder in registered form for two years
will carry a double voting right in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

In the event of a share capital increase by incorporation of reserves, profits or share premiums, this double voting right is
conferred from their date of issue to ordinary shares held in registered form and allocated for free to a shareholder by virtue
of the existing ordinary shares from which he derived this right.

A merger or demerger of Getlink SE has no effect on the double voting right that may be exercised at shareholder meetings
of the surviving companies if the articles of association of such companies so provide.

Any ordinary share converted into bearer form or which is transferred shall lose the double voting right conferred on it as
described in the preceding three paragraphs. However, the double voting right is not lost and the time benefits are not
affected by a transfer by inheritance, liquidation of assets held jointly by spouses or inter vivos gifts in favour of a spouse or
relative entitled to inherit.

**Voting rights of holders of E preference shares (article 11 of Getlink SE’s Articles of Association)**

E preference shares do not grant any voting rights at general meetings of the holders of ordinary shares; however, the
holders of class E preference shares will be entitled to attend a special meeting, in the event of any amendments to the rights
attached to this category of shares.

**8.3.5** **CLAUSES THAT MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE CONTROL OF GETLINK SE**

There are no provisions in the Articles of Association that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change
of control of Getlink SE.

**8.3.6** **IDENTIFICATION OF SHAREHOLDERS (ARTICLE 14 OF GETLINK SE’S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION)**

Getlink SE and its agent have the right to request the securities clearing house, either directly or through one or more
intermediaries as mentioned in article L. 211-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code for information relating to the
identification of Getlink’s shareholders in accordance with applicable laws and regulations (articles L. 228-2 et seq. of the
French Commercial Code) as follows: their name or in the case of legal entities, their company name, nationality, address,
number of shares held by each of them, any restrictions affecting the shares, the year of birth of the holder, or in the case of
a legal entity, the date of its incorporation.

###### Half-year activity report


###### HALF-YEAR ACTIVITY REPORT AT 30 JUNE 2021


###### PREPARATION OF THE HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

The Covid-19 pandemic led to the introduction of numerous restrictive measures in various countries during 2020 and this
situation has continued throughout the first half of 2021.

As indicated in this section and in notes A.1 and D.6 to the summary consolidated financial statements for the six months
ended 30 June 2021, the extension of the traffic restrictions and containment measures imposed by the French and UK
governments since March 2020 continue to have a significant impact on the Group’s traffic and revenues, particularly those
of Eurotunnel.

The general containment measures imposed in France and the UK, as well as the tighter border crossing and quarantine
restrictions for international travellers, have had a significant impact on Passenger Shuttle and Eurostar train activities in the
first six months of the year.

The Truck Shuttle business, albeit affected to a lesser extent by the public health crisis, was nevertheless impacted in the first
few months of 2021 by the implementation of Brexit on 1 January 2021 and the need for its customers to adapt to the new
administrative rules for crossing the border for flows entering the European Union.

In contrast to the Group’s cross-Channel activities, the Europorte segment’s activity returned to its pre-crisis level in the first
half of 2021.

Against this backdrop, the Group has continued in the first half of 2021 the measures designed to protect the health and
safety of its customers and staff, while ensuring the continued movement of goods and people and protect its profitability
and liquidity. In particular, the Group has continued to take action to protect its cash flow by maintaining short-time working
arrangements for some of its staff in France and the United Kingdom, as well as its cost reduction plan aimed at limiting its
expenses to the strict minimum. The Group continues to adapt its Shuttle capacity and operating plans to respond to the
decline in traffic while implementing specific measures to ensure the health and safety of its customers and maintain the
quality of its service. As in 2020, it has postponed a significant part of its capital expenditure that had been planned for the
first half of 2021, while ensuring that it maintains the expenditure necessary for safety and continuity of operations. All of
these measures remain in place at the end of the reporting period.

The reduced activity since the beginning of the pandemic has impacted the Group's results and cash flow. Nevertheless, the
Group has significant liquidity with net cash available at 30 June 2021 of €549 million enabling it to cover its debt service
over the remainder of 2021 and 2022 and to finance its activities.

###### ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT

To enable a better comparison between the two periods, the consolidated income statement for the first half of 2020
presented in this half-year activity report has been recalculated at the exchange rate used for the 2021 half-year income
statement of £1=€1.157.

The Group’s consolidated revenue continues to be severely impacted by the effects of the pandemic, with the entire first half
of the year affected in 2021 compared to 3½ months in the first half of 2020; the Group's consolidated revenue in the first
half of 2021 amounted to €326 million, a decrease of €44 million (-12%) compared to 2020. Faced with the reduction in
traffic from mid-March 2020, the Group implemented measures to limit the impact on its profitability and its cash flow, such
as partial activity in France and a job retention scheme in the UK, as well as the postponement of certain projects. These
measures are still in force and have had full effect in the first half of 2021: operating costs, which totalled €230 million,
decreased by €17 million (7%) compared to 2020. EBITDA reduced by €23 million (19%) to €100 million and at €6 million,
the operating profit for the first six months of 2021 was down by €26 million compared to 2020. After taking into account
an increase of €15 million in net finance costs (mainly due to the impact of higher inflation rates on the index-linked tranche
of the debt), the pre-tax result for the Group’s continuing operations for the first half of 2021 was a loss of €126 million, a
deterioration of €41 million compared to 2020.

After taking into account tax income of €3 million, the Group’s consolidated net result for the first six months of 2021 was a
loss of €123 million compared to a loss of €79 million in 2020.

The health crisis and the strict lockdown measures taken by governments have heavily impacted traffic and the organisation
of Eurotunnel's activities since mid-March 2020. Passenger Shuttle and Eurostar traffic remained severely affected by the
effects of the pandemic during the first half of 2021. Truck Shuttle traffic was also impacted in the first months of 2021 by
the consequences of Brexit which occurred on 1 January 2021.

###### Half-year activity report

**Truck Shuttle**

For the Short Straits market and cross-Channel logistics chains, the beginning of 2021 was marked by the need to adapt to
the new post-Brexit administrative rules as well as by the obligation, introduced at the end of 2020, to present negative PCR
tests of less than 72 hours carried out on British soil for trucks entering France. Although the last few months have seen
some recovery in traffic, it still remains below 2019 levels. In a Short Straits cross-Channel truck market that contracted by
2.0% in the first half of 2021, the Truck Shuttle Service’s market share was stable at 38.9% (39.2 % in the first half of 2020)
with 646,372 trucks carried by Eurotunnel, down 3% compared to the first half of 2020.

**Passenger Shuttle**

Measures put in place by governments to limit the spread of the pandemic since mid-March 2020 have included closing
international borders for non-essential travel and as a consequence, the level of tourist traffic on the Passenger Shuttle
Service has dropped dramatically since that date. In the first half of 2021, the Short Straits cross-Channel car market
contracted by 61.7% compared to the first half of 2020, whilst Eurotunnel’s car traffic decreased by only 55% thanks to a
market share improvement of 13 points compared to the previous year, to 78.8%.

In a market that contracted by 75.6% and with Eurotunnel's coach traffic declining by 64%, the Passenger Shuttle’s coach
market share for the first half of 2021 is up 25 points compared to the previous year, at 75.6% (50.7% in the first half of 2020).

** Rail freight services by train operators (DB Cargo for BRB, SNCF and its subsidiaries, GB Railfreight, Rail Operations Group, RailAdventure and Europorte)
using the Tunnel.

In the first half of 2021, revenues of €66 million were generated from the use of the Tunnel’s Railway Network by Eurostar’s
high-speed passenger trains and by the cross-Channel rail freight trains, down 31% compared to 2020 due to the impact of
the public health crisis and the closure of borders to non-essential travel.

The significant impact of the pandemic on Eurostar traffic, which began in March 2020, continued throughout 2020 and the
first half of 2021. In the first half of 2021, 202,022 Eurostar passengers used the Tunnel, down 90% compared to the same
period in 2020 and down 96% compared to the same period in 2019.

In the first half of 2021, cross-Channel rail freight continued to be affected by the loss of steel flows as well as a weakness in
automobile flows, but nevertheless recorded a growth of 2% in the number of trains compared to the same period in 2020.

**1.2** **EUROTUNNEL SEGMENT OPERATING COSTS**

At €172 million in the first half of 2021, operating expenses were down 10% compared to 2020. This decrease of €20 million
was mainly generated by the favourable impact of the continued implementation throughout the first half of 2021 of cost
saving measures such as partial activity in France and the Job Retention Scheme in the UK as well as other measures to adjust
expenses to lower traffic levels and to review the phasing of some projects in order to preserve the Group’s cash flow. In
2020, these measures were progressively implemented during the second quarter of the year.

Europorte saw a return to normal order volume in 2021 after a first half of 2020 impacted by the public health crisis, as well
as an acceleration in the development of cross-border flows with Belgium and Germany with the launch of the Flex Express
service. In the first half of 2021, Europorte recorded an increase of €8 million in revenue and an increase of €4 million in
EBITDA.

###### ELECLINK SEGMENT

ElecLink’s activity is the construction and operation of a 1 GW electricity interconnector between the UK and France.
Construction works began in 2016 and the cable installation was completed during the first half of 2021. As a result, the
interconnector is expected to be in commercial operation mid-2022.

Costs directly attributable to the project are capitalised as assets under construction. During the first half of 2021, investment
in the project amounted to €53 million.

###### OTHER INCOME

In the first half of 2021, the Group recognised income of €4 million relating to compensation for disruptions caused by
industrial action by Customs officers in 2019, as part of an agreement with the French State (see note A.3 of the summary
consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2021).

Despite the continuation of the measures put in place to limit its effects, the decline in traffic since March 2020 resulting
from the Covid-19 pandemic continues to have a very significant impact on the Group’s consolidated operating margin
(EBITDA), which at €100 million in the first half of 2021 is down by 19% compared to 2020.

###### Half-year activity report

 OPERATING PROFIT (EBIT)

At €92 million, depreciation charges increased by €1 million compared to the first half of 2020 as a result of the capital
investment projects completed in 2020.

The trading profit in the first half of 2021 was €8 million, down by €24 million (75%) compared to 2020.

The operating profit for the first six months of 2021 was down by €26 million (81%) compared to 2020, to €6 million.

###### NET FINANCIAL CHARGES

At €133 million for the first half of 2021, net finance costs increased by €14 million compared to 2020 at a constant exchange
rate. This increase was mainly as a result of the impact of higher inflation rates in the UK and France on the index-linked
tranches of the debt (€15 million).

###### NET CONSOLIDATED RESULT

The Group’s pre-tax result for continuing operations for the first six months of 2021 was a loss of €126 million, a deterioration
of €41 million compared to 2020 at a constant exchange rate. The evolution of the pre-tax result from continuing operations

of unrealised intra-Group exchange losses in the first half of 2020.

After taking into account a net deferred tax income of €3 million, the Group’s net consolidated result for the first half of the
2021 financial year was a loss of €123 million compared to a loss of €79 million at an equivalent exchange rate for the same
period in 2020.

Other non-current assets at 30 June 2021
include the G2 inflation-linked notes held by the Group amounting to €335 million and a deferred tax asset of €190

At 30 June 2021, “Cash and cash equivalents” amounted to €549 million after net capital expenditure of €55 million and
€129 million in debt service costs (interest, repayments and fees).

Equity increased by €58 million as a result of the impact of the recycling of the fair value of value of partially terminated
hedging contracts and the change in the fair value of the financial instruments totalling €229 million and the recognition
of an actuarial gain on employee benefits of €53 million. This increase was partially offset by the impact of net result for
the period (loss of €123 million), payment of €27 million in dividends and by the impact of the change in the exchange
rate on the translation adjustment (€75 million).

Financial liabilities increased by €91 million compared to 31 December 2020 due to the impact of the change in exchange
rate on the sterling-denominated debt (€105 million) and an increase of €24 million arising from the impact of the
amortisation of debt issuance costs and from the effect of inflation on the index-linked debt tranches of the Term Loan.
These increases have been partially offset by contractual debt repayments of €29 million and a decrease of €10 million
in the liability relating to lease contracts.

The liability in respect of the fair value of the interest rate derivatives decreased by €210 million due to the impact of an
increase in the long term rates on the market value of the financial instruments.

Other liabilities include €252 million of trade and other payables, provisions, deferred income and other liabilities, as well
as retirement liabilities of €104 million.

- MyFerryLink maritime segment, see note C.2 to the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2021.

At €110 million, net cash generated from trading by continuing operations in the first half of 2021 reduced by €48 million
compared to the first half of 2020. This change is explained mainly by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Eurotunnel’s
activities:

net cash flow from Eurotunnel and Getlink activities which decreased by €53 million to €98 million (first half 2020: €151
million). This includes the receipt of €4 million in respect of an indemnity under an agreement with the French State (see
note A.3 to the summary half-year financial statements at 30 June 2021);

net cash flows from Europorte’s operations which increased by €5 million to €13 million (first half 2020: €8 million); and

ElecLink’s operating expenses which remained relatively stable at around €1 million.

Other operating and taxation cash flows of €15 million are mainly related to the receipt of the final payment of £11 million
in respect of the settlement agreement between the British Secretary of State for Transport and Eurotunnel reached in 2019
(the last of three annual instalments).

As explained above, the Group took the decision to postpone a significant portion of its capital expenditure that had been
planned for the first half of 2021 as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. In the first half of 2021, net cash flows from investing
activities of €55 million, comprised mainly:

a net amount of €23 million relating to the Eurotunnel and Getlink segments (first half of 2020: €38 million), including a
receipt of €18 million in respect of the partial reimbursement by the French State for Brexit-related investments under
an agreement reached in March 2021 (see note A.3 to the summary half-year financial statements at 30 June 2021). The
main expenditure during the period comprised €13 million for facilities for Brexit and other infrastructure projects and
€21 million on rolling stock; and

net payments of €30 million relating to the construction works for the ElecLink project (net receipts of €2 million in the
first half of 2020 due to the return of a deposit held by RTE).

Net financing payments in the first half of 2021 amounted to €159 million compared to €129 million in the first half of 2020.
During 2021, cash flow from financing comprised:

€30 million paid in respect of capital transactions:

   - €27 million paid in dividends (€0 million in the first half of 2020); and

   - €3 million net payments on the liquidity contract (€4 million net receipts in the first half of 2020).

€129 million of net debt service costs:

   - €96 million of interest paid on the Term Loan and on other borrowings (€91 million in the first half of 2020);

   - €29 million paid in respect of the scheduled repayments on the Term Loan and other borrowings (€26 million in the
first half of 2020);

   - €3 million of cash received from the scheduled repayment of the G2 notes held by the Group and €3 million of interest
received thereon; and

   - €10 million paid in relation to leasing contracts (€10 million in the first half of 2020) presented in cash flows related
to financing activities in accordance with IFRS 16.

**EBITDA to finance cost ratio**

The ratio of the Group’s consolidated EBITDA to its finance costs (excluding interest received and indexation) as defined in
section 2.1.4.b of the 2020 Universal Registration Document was 0.88 at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020 restated: 1.07).

**Net debt to EBITDA ratio**

The Group defines its net debt to EBITDA ratio as the ratio between financial liabilities less the indexed nominal value of the
G2 notes held by the Group and cash and cash equivalents, and consolidated EBITDA. The Group does not consider it
appropriate to publish this ratio when calculated based on the activity of a six-month period. At 31 December 2020, the ratio
was 12.6.

###### COVENANTS RELATING TO THE GROUP’S DEBT

**Eurotunnel**

The debt service cover ratio and the synthetic service cover ratio on the Term Loan apply to the Eurotunnel Holding SAS
sub-group. These ratios are described in note G.1.2.b to the consolidated financial statements contained in section 2.2.1 of
the 2020 Universal Registration Document.

In the context of the public health crisis and as a precautionary measure, on 17 October 2020, the Group agreed a waiver
with its creditors on its principal covenant, the senior debt coverage ratio (see note A.1 to the consolidated financial
statements in section 2.2.1 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document). For the period ending 30 June 2021, the Group
has exercised the option not to use it.

For the 12 months to 30 June 2021, Eurotunnel has respected its financial covenants under the Term Loan.

**Getlink**

The conditions attached to the 2025 Green Bonds issued by Getlink SE include financial ratios, or incurrence covenants, the
non-compliance with which may prevent the completion of certain transactions such as the payment of dividends or the
raising of additional financing, without however giving rise to an event of default. The Group did not comply with these
ratios as of 30 June 2021; however, the refinancing transaction concluded by Getlink in October 2020 increased the Group’s
flexibility to raise new financing (up to €400 million) and its ability to pay dividends (€150 million per year up to €300 million)
without having to comply with these ratios. For more information, see notes A.4 and G.1.1 to the consolidated financial
statements in section 2.2.1 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document.

###### Half-year activity report

 OUTLOOK

As indicated in this half-year activity report and in notes A.1 and D.6 to the summary half-year consolidated financial
statements as at 30 June 2021, the Group’s results and financial position in the first half of 2021, and in particular those of
the Eurotunnel segment, continued to be strongly impacted by the effects of the strict measures taken by the French and
UK governments in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The general containment measures in place in the UK since the end of 2020 and reintroduced in France in April 2021, as well
as the tightening of border crossing and quarantine restrictions for international travellers since the beginning of the year,
have resulted in a further decline in Passenger Shuttle and Eurostar train traffic in the first six months of 2021.

Despite the progress made in terms of vaccination of the population and the progressive easing of containment measures
in the UK and in Europe over the last few weeks, the cross-Channel passenger market is still affected by the uncertainties
linked to the Covid-19 crisis, particularly with regard to the evolution of the variants and international transport restrictions:
the flow of travellers between the UK and continental Europe fluctuates according to the health situation in the countries
and the vaccination status of travellers. The recent decisions of the British government to maintain quarantine measures for
travellers arriving from France, even if they have been doubly vaccinated, and of the French government to impose the
"health pass" in certain public places, may delay the resumption of traffic over the next few weeks. However, the Group, while
recognising that the situation remains uncertain and could change further, is confident that its Passenger Shuttle traffic will
rebound once travel restrictions are relaxed, as was the case in the summer of 2020. The Passenger Shuttle service continues
to benefit from its position as an extremely safe mode of transport in the health context, with a market share in the first half
of 2021 approaching 80%.

Truck Shuttle traffic, impacted at the beginning of 2021 by the need for its customers to adapt to the new administrative
rules for crossing the border for flows entering the European Union following the implementation of Brexit on 1 January,
gradually recovered during the period. The Group is actively preparing for the entry into force, (expected by early 2022), of
the new arrangements for border controls on entry to the UK. The impact of Brexit on the Truck Shuttle business in the
medium term will depend on the development of the cross-Channel market and the regulatory arrangements for trade
between the UK and the EU.

The Group is closely monitoring the announced changes in the competitive environment in the Short Straits market, in
particular the arrival of a new entrant in the Short Straits market and the announcement of a cooperation agreement between
the main ferry operators.

Despite the difficult short-term environment, the Group is pursuing its commercial strategy focused on the quality of its
Shuttle services and on optimised yield management for both cars and trucks, with a view to sustainable growth. The
reintroduction of duty-free sales at the Folkestone terminal from the beginning of 2021 and at the Coquelles terminal in the
second half of 2021 will further strengthen the commercial offer of the Shuttle services.

The Group continues to invest in technological solutions to facilitate the border crossing of its customers in the new health
and regulatory context, with the introduction in the first half of 2021 of additional assistance services, the "Eurotunnel Border
Pass" for its Truck Shuttle customers and the "Passenger Wallet" for its Passenger Shuttle customers.

Eurostar traffic, still penalised by travel restrictions between the UK and continental Europe resulting from the public health
crisis, remained at a very low level in the first half of 2021, and, following recent announcements, is likely to remain so over
the coming weeks. The launch at the end of 2020 of the direct service between Amsterdam and London strengthens
Eurostar's offer in the medium term. In addition, the Group notes the refinancing deal concluded by Eurostar in the first half
of 2021.

In 2021, the Group is continuing with the actions implemented in 2020 to limit its costs and preserve cash, in particular by
dynamically adjusting the capacity and operating plans of its Shuttles in line with traffic levels and by using the partial activity
scheme for its staff as required.

The Group also plans to limit the level of its capital expenditure in 2021 to a level similar to that of 2020, by deferring certain
expenditure on major renewal programmes, while continuing to give priority to projects related to safety and service
continuity. The postponement of this expenditure in the context of the public health crisis does not alter the Group's
medium-term investment strategy, which is focused on strengthening the quality of service and modernising its equipment
and infrastructure.

**Europorte, which had a relatively limited impact from the public health crisis in 2020, returned to its pre-crisis traffic levels**
in the first half of 2021 and continues to pursue its strategy of controlled growth, with the launch in March of Flex Express,
a new rail shuttle service between France, Germany and the Benelux countries.

As far as ElecLink is concerned, following the agreement obtained from the IGC on 10 December 2020, the installation work
on the cable in the Tunnel was completed on 20 June 2021. A phase of in-depth tests and trials will be launched in the
second half of 2021 before commercial operation, still planned for mid-2022. As part of the derogation granted in 2014,
ElecLink obtained in the first half of 2021 the agreement of the national regulators and the European Commission on the
extension of the deadline for the interconnector's commissioning to 15 August 2022.

###### Half-year activity report

**Objectives**

The lack of short-term visibility does not affect the Group's long-term strength and competitive advantages, including
environmental, of its various businesses, nor their medium and long-term growth potential.

The Group confirms its commitment to improve its financial, operational and environmental performance.

Given the uncertainties regarding the cross-Channel border crossing imposed by the various governments, the Group is not
in a position to give a financial trajectory for the 2021 financial year.

**Cash position and financial ratios**

Despite the unfavourable environment, the various measures taken by the Group throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021
have enabled it to comply with the covenants relating to the Eurotunnel Term Loan at 30 June 2021 and to strengthen its
liquidity position.

At 30 June 2021, the Group's cash position was €549 million. On the basis of its forecasts, based on the information available
to date and its best assessment of how the situation, particularly in terms of the public health crisis and the economy, could
evolve in the short and medium term, the Group considers that it has sufficient liquidity to cover the servicing of its debt for
the remainder of 2021 and 2022, as well as the financing of its activities.

In October 2020, the Group entered into a waiver agreement with its creditors on its main covenant at 31 December 2020
and on an option at 30 June 2021 and 31 December 2021.

###### RISKS

The principal risks and uncertainties that the Group may face in the remaining six months of the financial year are identified
in chapter 3 "Risks and Controls" of the 2020 Universal Registration Document which includes a detailed description of the
risk factors to which the Group is exposed, and in particular, those relating to the public health crisis, the consequences of
Brexit and the competitive environment. However, other risks, not identified at the date of publication of this half-year
financial report, may exist.

###### RELATED PARTIES

In the first half of 2021, the Group did not have any related parties transactions as defined by IAS 24.

###### Summary consolidated half-year financial statements

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Getlink SE is the Group’s consolidating entity. Its registered office is at 3 rue La Boétie, 75008 Paris, France, and its shares are
listed on Euronext Paris. The term “Getlink SE” refers to the holding company which is governed by French law. The term
“Group” refers to Getlink SE and all its subsidiaries.

The main activities of the Group are the design, financing, construction and operation by the Eurotunnel segment of the
Fixed Link’s infrastructure and transport system in accordance with the terms of the Concession (which will expire in 2086),
the rail freight activity of the Europorte segment as well as the construction and operation (expected mid-2022) of the 1 GW
electricity interconnector in the Tunnel by ElecLink. The maritime activity was discontinued in 2015 (see note C.2 below).

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements for 2021 were approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting
held on 21 July 2021.

###### A. Important events

 A.1 Activity in the first half of 2021

**A.1.1** **Covid-19 pandemic**

The strict population containment and movement restriction measures put in place in 2020 by the French and British
governments in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic have been continued during the first half of 2021.

The public health crisis and the measures taken by the governments have had a very significant impact on the Group’s traffic
and its internal organisation, and more particularly on Eurotunnel’s activities, which continued to experience a very sharp fall
in traffic in the first half of 2021, particularly on Passenger Shuttles and in the number of Eurostar passengers.

Faced with this situation, the Group has maintained the various measures which it launched in 2020, aimed at enabling the
movement of goods, while ensuring the safety of its customers and staff.

It has also continued to take action to preserve its cash flow by maintaining partial activity arrangements for some of its staff
in France and in the United Kingdom. The Group also continued its cost reduction plan aimed at limiting its expenses to the
strict minimum and postponing a significant portion of its capital expenditure that it had planned for the first half of 2021,
while ensuring that it maintains the expenses necessary for safety and continuity of operations. All of these measures remain
in place at the balance sheet date.

The impact of the public health crisis and the measures implemented by the Group on the Group’s results and financial
position in the first half of 2021 is detailed in note D.6 below.

Despite this unfavourable environment, the various measures taken by the Group during 2020 and the first half of 2021 have
enabled it to comply with the covenants relating to the Eurotunnel Term Loan as at 30 June 2021, and to strengthen its
liquidity position. At 30 June 2021, the Group's cash and cash equivalents amounted to €549 million.

In October 2020, the Group entered into a waiver agreement with its creditors on its main covenant as at 31 December 2020
and on an option as at 30 June 2021 and 31 December 2021. The Group has not made use of this waiver as at 30 June 2021.
The waiver is subject to certain conditions including the holding of a minimum cash balance of approximately €200 million
at the level of the Eurotunnel sub-group at the relevant dates. At 30 June 2021, the cash held by the Eurotunnel sub-group
amounted to €276 million.

**A.1.2** **Brexit: the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union**

Following the decision of the referendum on 23 June 2016 and the triggering of Article 50 by the UK Government at the end
of March 2017, the transition period for the UK’s official exit from the European Union ended on 31 December 2020. The
new procedures for managing vehicle and goods controls on entry to the EU have been effective since 1 January 2021 at the
Coquelles terminal. Truck Shuttle traffic was impacted in the first months of 2021 by the adaptation of its customers to these
new administrative rules for crossing the border.

During the first half of 2021, the UK government announced the postponement of the application of the new provisions
relating to border controls on entry to the UK. These controls, which will apply at the border from 1 January 2022, will be
progressively implemented from 1 October 2021.

The Group has updated its budget forecasts for 2021 and subsequent years, based on the information available to date and
its best assessment of how the situation, particularly health and regulatory issues, could evolve in the short to medium term.
On the basis of these forecasts, the Group will have sufficient liquidity to cover the servicing of its debt over the remainder
of 2021 and 2022 and the financing of its activities.

The Group has taken this context into account in determining the main estimates and assumptions made in the context of
the preparation of its summary consolidated financial statements as at 30 June 2021 as set out in note B.4 below. The
indication of impairment identified on the Concession assets led the Group to perform an impairment test on these assets
at 30 June 2021, which did not result in the recognition of an impairment at that date (see note F below).

 A.2 ElecLink project

Following IGC approval on 10 December 2020, the cable installation work, which started in January 2021, was completed on
20 June 2021. A phase of extensive testing and trials will be carried out in the second half of 2021 before commercial
operation can begin, which is still planned for mid-2022.

Investment in the project during the first half of 2021 amounted to €53 million (including capitalised expenses). The amount
recorded in the Group’s balance sheet as at 30 June 2021 was €852 million, of which €732 million is in tangible assets and
€120 million in intangible assets.

In addition, the exemption under Article 17 of the European Union Electricity Regulation granted to ElecLink by the national
regulators and the European Commission in 2014 was conditional on the interconnector being commissioned before 31 July
2020. During 2020, and as part of the IGC agreement reached on 10 December 2020, the national regulators and the
European Commission granted an extension until 30 June 2021 allowing the stakeholders to finalise an agreement on the
final commissioning date. In the first half of 2021, ElecLink submitted a request for a final extension, bringing the deadline
for commissioning the interconnector to 15 August 2022. The national regulators and the European Commission have
confirmed their agreement to this request.

###### A.3 Transactional agreement with the French government

On 17 March 2021, the Group entered into a settlement agreement with the French government following a claim for
compensation for part of the costs it had incurred in connection with the investments requested by the government for the
construction of the works and facilities required to enable the new customs, sanitary and phytosanitary border controls made
compulsory by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, and also for financial compensation following the
industrial action by Customs officers in March 2019. Under the terms of this agreement, the Group received a settlement
indemnity of €22 million during the first half of 2021. In the Group’s half-year consolidated financial statements for the six
months ended 30 June 2021, this indemnity was recognised for €18 million in respect of Brexit-related investments and for
€4 million in other income in respect of compensation for disruption caused by the industrial action by Customs officers.

###### A.4 Duty Free

On 10 June 2021, the French government announced its decision to authorise the re-establishment of duty free at
Eurotunnel's French terminal in Coquelles. This activity will start in the second half of the year in addition to the duty free
activity already in place since the beginning of 2021 at the Folkestone terminal.

###### B. Principles of preparation, main accounting policies and
 methods

 B.1 Statement of compliance 

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union and applicable on 30 June 2021. They have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and therefore do not
contain all the information required for complete annual financial statements and must be read in conjunction with Getlink
SE’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.

###### B.2 Basis of preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements for Getlink SE and its subsidiaries are prepared as at 30 June.

The summary half-year consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the principles of currency conversion as
defined in the annual financial statements as at 31 December 2020.

The average and closing exchange rates used in the preparation of the 2021 and 2020 half-year accounts and the 2020
annual accounts are as follows:

###### Summary consolidated half-year financial statements

 B.3 Changes in accounting standards as at 30 June 2021

The standards and interpretations used and described in the annual financial statements as at 31 December 2020 have been
supplemented by the standards, amendments and interpretations whose application is mandatory for financial years
beginning on or after 1 January 2021.

**B.3.1** **Texts adopted by the European Union whose application is compulsory**

**Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - interest rate benchmark reform, phase 2**

A reform of the main reference rates is underway with the replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) with alternative
risk free rates.

The Group has applied the provisions of the amendments to IFRS 9 Phase 2 and IFRS 7 as at 1 January 2021, which include
a series of temporary provisions allowing hedging relationships to continue without interruption when there is a change in
the reference rate affecting a hedged item and/or a hedging instrument.

For the Group, the main exposure is the sterling LIBOR associated with certain financial instruments (the C1a tranche of the
Term Loan with a nominal value of £350 million) and the related hedging contract with a nominal value of £350 million and
to a lesser extent certain commercial contracts (interest on arrears, etc.).

On 5 March 2021, the UK financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), announced that the provision
of information by the panel banks for the purpose of determining, among other things, GBP LIBOR rates will cease on 31
December 2021. The Group expects to complete its work to update its contracts or implement fallback provisions in response
to this reform by the end of 2021.

The transition of rates does not have any impact on the Group's summary half-year consolidated financial statements as at
30 June 2021.

**B.3.2** **Texts and amendments published by the IASB but not approved by the European Union**

The following texts concerning accounting rules and methods specifically applied by the Group have not yet been approved
by the European Union:

amendments to IFRS 3 – references to the conceptual framework;

amendments to IAS 37 – onerous contracts - contract performance costs; and

amendments to IFRS 16 – lease arrangements beyond 30 June 2021.

The potential impact of these texts will be assessed by the Group in subsequent years.

###### B.4 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. The Group’s
management and Board of Directors periodically review its valuations and estimates based on their experience and various
other factors considered relevant for the determination of reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’
carrying value. In addition, the estimates underlying the preparation of these half-year consolidated financial statements to
30 June 2021 have been established in the context of the uncertainties concerning the Covid-19 pandemic and the
implementation of Brexit. Depending on the evolution of these assumptions, actual results may differ from current estimates.

The use of estimations concerns mainly the valuation of intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment (see note F)
in particular for the ElecLink project, the evaluation of the Group’s deferred tax situation (note I), the valuation of the Group’s
retirement liabilities (note E) and certain elements of the valuation of financial assets and liabilities (note G.5) as well as the
application of IFRS 16 “Leases” in particular for the definition of the lease and the estimation of the remaining term of each
lease.

###### Summary consolidated half-year financial statements

 D.6 Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic

As indicated in note A.1 above, the public health crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken since March
2020 by the French and British governments concerning the confinement of the population and the movement of people
within and between the two countries has had a significant impact on the Group’s business and results, in particular on those
of Eurotunnel, in the first half of both 2020 and 2021.

**Eurotunnel**

In the first two months of 2020, traffic across Eurotunnel’s various businesses was at a similar level to 2019 but from midMarch 2020 onwards, traffic fell sharply due to the containment measures and travel restrictions put in place by governments
in response to the first wave of the public health crisis.

In the first half of 2021, the general containment measures imposed in France and the UK, as well as the more stringent
border crossing and quarantine restrictions for international travellers, continued to have a significant impact on the activities
of Passenger Shuttles and Eurostar. For the months of January and February 2021, compared to the same period in 2020,
Passenger Shuttle traffic was down 76% and Eurostar passenger numbers fell by 96%. For the four months of March to June,
with travel restrictions in place in both years, 2021 Passenger Shuttle traffic was down by 24% and Eurostar passenger
numbers were down by 65%.

The Truck Shuttle business was less affected by the public health crisis in the first half of 2021 than in 2020, in particular
because of the exemption from the rules applicable to international travel for certain categories of workers, including lorry
drivers. Truck Shuttle traffic in January and February 2021, impacted by the need for its customers to adapt to the new
administrative rules for crossing the border for flows entering the European Union following the implementation of Brexit
on 1 January 2021, was down by 31% compared to the same period in 2020 and cross-Channel rail freight train traffic was
down by 20%. In contrast, for the four months from March to June, Truck Shuttle traffic was up by 15% and cross-Channel
freight train traffic by 17%, but the level of traffic for these activities nevertheless remained below 2019 levels, by -11% and
-23% respectively.

2019 variance compared to 2021.

Eurotunnel’s revenues decreased by €52 million in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 at a constant
exchange rate. This decrease was mainly concentrated in the first two months of the year where, in 2021, revenue was heavily
impacted by the fall in Shuttle Services and Eurostar passenger traffic, whereas in 2020, prior to the onset of the Covid crisis,
this traffic was at a relatively normal level. Eurotunnel’s revenue for the months of March to June was up by €17 million in
2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the relative improvement in the Truck Shuttle and cross-Channel freight train businesses.

2019 variance compared to 2021.

Eurotunnel’s operating and staff costs decreased by €20 million in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period in
2020 at a constant exchange rate. This decrease is mainly due to the savings generated by the actions implemented by the
Group in its management of the public health crisis. In response to the fall in traffic since March 2020, the Group has revised
its Shuttle capacity and operating plans downwards and, as part of the measures put in place by the French and British
governments, has introduced partial activity measures for some of its staff in France and the United Kingdom. These
measures remained in place throughout the first half of 2021.

**Group**

In the first half of 2021, the Group’s EBITDA decreased by €23 million compared to the same period in 2020 at a constant
exchange rate. This decrease only concerns the Eurotunnel segment and is concentrated in the first two months of the year.
However, the period from March to June 2021 saw an improvement of €29 million (52%) compared to the same period in
2020 mainly due to the relative recovery in Truck Shuttle traffic. EBITDA for the first half of 2021 was down by €157 million
(-61%) compared to the first half of 2019 (the base year, before the public health crisis).

###### Summary consolidated half-year financial statements

 E.2 Retirement benefits

At 30 June 2021, the Group reviewed the main assumptions used in its actuarial calculations and updated the amount of its
pension obligations in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom. On this basis, as at 30 June
2021, the UK pension liability was decreased by €56 million compared to 31 December 2020. The corresponding actuarial
gain was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as at 30 June 2021.

###### F. Intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment

**Investments during the period**

The €53 million investment in the ElecLink project between 31 December 2020 and 30 June 2021 is mainly explained by
capitalised expenses relating to the project.

**Indications of impairment and impairment tests**

Concession property, plant and equipment

The significant decline in Eurotunnel revenues in the first half of 2021 (see note D.6 above) constitutes an indication of
impairment under IAS 36. Consequently, the Group carried out a value-in-use test of the assets of this segment at 30 June
2021 to ensure that the recoverable amount of assets remains higher than their net book value.

The valuation test at 30 June 2021 is based on the latest financial estimates prepared by the Group and presented to Getlink's
Board of Directors on 17 June 2021. It was based on a WACC of 5.87% (5.79% at 31 December 2020) and the Group’s best
estimates at that date of the likely evolution of the public health crisis, government measures and the economic situation in
Europe and the United Kingdom over the short and medium term. In particular, the test includes the assumption of a gradual
recovery in Shuttle and Railway Network traffic and revenues over the second half of 2021 and in 2022 and 2023 to return
to pre-crisis levels, followed by revenue growth of approximately 2% per year thereafter. This test confirms that the
recoverable amount of Eurotunnel’s Concession assets is higher than their carrying amount at 30 June 2021.

The Group has also carried out sensitivity analyses on changes in its crisis exit projections and other key assumptions
(discount rate, long-term revenue growth rate, sterling / euro exchange rate). These analyses did not reveal any probable
scenario leading to an impairment of the Concession assets.

Europorte property, plant and equipment

As at 30 June 2021, the Group has not identified any impairment of Europorte’s assets.

ElecLink property, plant and equipment

As indicated in note A.2, the cable installation work was completed on 20 June 2021, with the start of operations still
scheduled for mid-2022. As a result, the Group has not identified any impairment of the ElecLink assets as at 30 June 2021.

###### Summary half-year consolidated financial statements

 G.2 Hedging instruments

In 2007, the Group put in place hedging contracts to cover its floating rate loans (tranches C1 and C2) in the form of swaps
for the same duration and for the same value (EURIBOR against a fixed rate of 4.90% and LIBOR against a fixed rate of 5.26%).
The nominal value of hedging swap is €953 million and £350 million. These derivatives were partially terminated as part of
the refinancing of tranche C in June 2017.

These derivatives have been measured at their fair value as a liability on the statement of financial position as follows:

To the Shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by the general meeting and in accordance with the requirements of article
L. 451-1-2 III of the French Monetary and Financial Code ("Code monétaire et financier"), we hereby report to you on:

the review of the accompanying summary half-year consolidated financial statements of Getlink S.E., for the period from
1 January to 30 June, 2021,

the verification of the information presented in the half-year activity report.

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the summary half-yearly consolidated financial statements of this
period have been prepared and reviewed under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken
in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their
operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as
travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance
of our procedures.

These summary half-year consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. Our role is to
express a conclusion on these financial statements based on our review.

**I - Conclusion on the financial statements**

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. A review of interim financial
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying summary half-year
consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 - standard of the IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

**II – Specific verification**

We have also verified the information presented in the half-year management report on the summary half-year consolidated
financial statements subject to our review. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and consistency with the
summary half-year consolidated financial statements.
